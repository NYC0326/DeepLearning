1311.2191,Neighborhood filters and the decreasing rearrangement,"Nonlocal filters are simple and powerful techniques for image denoising. In this paper, we give new insights into the analysis of one kind of them, the Neighborhood filter, by using a classical although not very common transformation: the decreasing rearrangement of a function (the image). Independently of the dimension of the image, we reformulate the Neighborhood filter and its iterative variants as an integral operator defined in a one-dimensional space. The simplicity of this formulation allows to perform a detailed analysis of its properties. Among others, we prove that the filter behaves asymptotically as a shock filter combined with a border diffusive term, responsible for the staircaising effect and the loss of contrast."
1311.3269,On a non-local spectrogram for denoising one-dimensional signals,"In previous works, we investigated the use of local filters based on partial differential equations (PDE) to denoise one-dimensional signals through the image processing of time-frequency representations, such as the spectrogram. In this image denoising algorithms, the particularity of the image was hardly taken into account. We turn, in this paper, to study the performance of non-local filters, like Neighborhood or Yaroslavsky filters, in the same problem. We show that, for certain iterative schemes involving the Neighborhood filter, the computational time is drastically reduced with respect to Yaroslavsky or nonlinear PDE based filters, while the outputs of the filtering processes are similar. This is heuristically justified by the connection between the (fast) Neighborhood filter applied to a spectrogram and the corresponding Nonlocal Means filter (accurate) applied to the Wigner-Ville distribution of the signal. This correspondence holds only for time-frequency representations of one-dimensional signals, not to usual images, and in this sense the particularity of the image is exploited. We compare though a series of experiments on synthetic and biomedical signals the performance of local and non-local filters."
1404.0736,Exploiting Linear Structure Within Convolutional Networks for Efficient   Evaluation,"We present techniques for speeding up the test-time evaluation of large convolutional networks, designed for object recognition tasks. These models deliver impressive accuracy but each image evaluation requires millions of floating point operations, making their deployment on smartphones and Internet-scale clusters problematic. The computation is dominated by the convolution operations in the lower layers of the model. We exploit the linear structure present within the convolutional filters to derive approximations that significantly reduce the required computation. Using large state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate we demonstrate speedups of convolutional layers on both CPU and GPU by a factor of 2x, while keeping the accuracy within 1% of the original model."
1404.6055,A General Homogeneous Matrix Formulation to 3D Rotation Geometric   Transformations,We present algebraic projective geometry definitions of 3D rotations so as to bridge a small gap between the applications and the definitions of 3D rotations in homogeneous matrix form. A general homogeneous matrix formulation to 3D rotation geometric transformations is proposed which suits for the cases when the rotation axis is unnecessarily through the coordinate system origin given their rotation axes and rotation angles.   General three-dimensional rotation formula~\eqref{eqn:3D homogeneous roation} and~\eqref{eqn:3D rotation matrix vector Euclidean} similar to the Euler-Rodrigues formula were presented. The matrix-vector form of 3D rotation in Euclidean space is especially suited for numerical applications where gimbal lock is a concern.}
1407.7504,A Fast Hierarchical Method for Multi-script and Arbitrary Oriented Scene   Text Extraction,"Typography and layout lead to the hierarchical organisation of text in words, text lines, paragraphs. This inherent structure is a key property of text in any script and language, which has nonetheless been minimally leveraged by existing text detection methods. This paper addresses the problem of text segmentation in natural scenes from a hierarchical perspective. Contrary to existing methods, we make explicit use of text structure, aiming directly to the detection of region groupings corresponding to text within a hierarchy produced by an agglomerative similarity clustering process over individual regions. We propose an optimal way to construct such an hierarchy introducing a feature space designed to produce text group hypotheses with high recall and a novel stopping rule combining a discriminative classifier and a probabilistic measure of group meaningfulness based in perceptual organization. Results obtained over four standard datasets, covering text in variable orientations and different languages, demonstrate that our algorithm, while being trained in a single mixed dataset, outperforms state of the art methods in unconstrained scenarios."
1412.8656,A multistep segmentation algorithm for vessel extraction in medical imaging,"The main contribution of this paper is to propose an iterative procedure for tubular structure segmentation of 2D images, which combines tight frame of Curvelet transforms with a SURE technique thresholding which is based on principle obtained by minimizing Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate for denoising. This proposed algorithm is mainly based on the TFA proposal presented in [1, 9], which we use eigenvectors of Hessian matrix of image for improving this iterative part in segmenting unclear and narrow vessels and filling the gap between separate pieces of detected vessels. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model."
1505.00412,On a fast bilateral filtering formulation using functional   rearrangements,"We introduce an exact reformulation of a broad class of neighborhood filters, among which the bilateral filters, in terms of two functional rearrangements: the decreasing and the relative rearrangements.   Independently of the image spatial dimension (one-dimensional signal, image, volume of images, etc.), we reformulate these filters as integral operators defined in a one-dimensional space corresponding to the level sets measures.   We prove the equivalence between the usual pixel-based version and the rearranged version of the filter. When restricted to the discrete setting, our reformulation of bilateral filters extends previous results for the so-called fast bilateral filtering. We, in addition, prove that the solution of the discrete setting, understood as constant-wise interpolators, converges to the solution of the continuous setting.   Finally, we numerically illustrate computational aspects concerning quality approximation and execution time provided by the rearranged formulation."
1505.05489,A Sparse Gaussian Process Framework for Photometric Redshift Estimation,"Accurate photometric redshifts are a lynchpin for many future experiments to pin down the cosmological model and for studies of galaxy evolution. In this study, a novel sparse regression framework for photometric redshift estimation is presented. Simulated and real data from SDSS DR12 were used to train and test the proposed models. We show that approaches which include careful data preparation and model design offer a significant improvement in comparison with several competing machine learning algorithms. Standard implementations of most regression algorithms have as the objective the minimization of the sum of squared errors. For redshift inference, however, this induces a bias in the posterior mean of the output distribution, which can be problematic. In this paper we directly target minimizing $\Delta z = (z_\textrm{s} - z_\textrm{p})/(1+z_\textrm{s})$ and address the bias problem via a distribution-based weighting scheme, incorporated as part of the optimization objective. The results are compared with other machine learning algorithms in the field such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gaussian Processes (GPs) and sparse GPs. The proposed framework reaches a mean absolute $\Delta z = 0.0026(1+z_\textrm{s})$, over the redshift range of $0 \le z_\textrm{s} \le 2$ on the simulated data, and $\Delta z = 0.0178(1+z_\textrm{s})$ over the entire redshift range on the SDSS DR12 survey, outperforming the standard ANNz used in the literature. We also investigate how the relative size of the training set affects the photometric redshift accuracy. We find that a training set of \textgreater 30 per cent of total sample size, provides little additional constraint on the photometric redshifts, and note that our GP formalism strongly outperforms ANNz in the sparse data regime for the simulated data set."
1505.08070,General Deformations of Point Configurations Viewed By a Pinhole Model   Camera,This paper is a theoretical study of the following Non-Rigid Structure from Motion problem. What can be computed from a monocular view of a parametrically deforming set of points? We treat various variations of this problem for affine and polynomial deformations with calibrated and uncalibrated cameras. We show that in general at least three images with quasi-identical two deformations are needed in order to have a finite set of solutions of the points' structure and calculate some simple examples.
1506.02247,Well-posedness of a nonlinear integro-differential problem and its   rearranged formulation,"We study the existence and uniqueness of solutions of a nonlinear integro-differential problem which we reformulate introducing the notion of the decreasing rearrangement of the solution. A dimensional reduction of the problem is obtained and a detailed analysis of the properties of the solutions of the model is provided. Finally, a fast numerical method is devised and implemented to show the performance of the model when typical image processing tasks such as filtering and segmentation are performed."
1606.07757,A Taxonomy and Library for Visualizing Learned Features in Convolutional   Neural Networks,"Over the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) saw a tremendous surge in performance. However, understanding what a network has learned still proves to be a challenging task. To remedy this unsatisfactory situation, a number of groups have recently proposed different methods to visualize the learned models. In this work we suggest a general taxonomy to classify and compare these methods, subdividing the literature into three main categories and providing researchers with a terminology to base their works on. Furthermore, we introduce the FeatureVis library for MatConvNet: an extendable, easy to use open source library for visualizing CNNs. It contains implementations from each of the three main classes of visualization methods and serves as a useful tool for an enhanced understanding of the features learned by intermediate layers, as well as for the analysis of why a network might fail for certain examples."
1607.01327,Feature Selection Library (MATLAB Toolbox),"The Feature Selection Library (FSLib) introduces a comprehensive suite of feature selection (FS) algorithms for MATLAB, aimed at improving machine learning and data mining tasks. FSLib encompasses filter, embedded, and wrapper methods to cater to diverse FS requirements. Filter methods focus on the inherent characteristics of features, embedded methods incorporate FS within model training, and wrapper methods assess features through model performance metrics. By enabling effective feature selection, FSLib addresses the curse of dimensionality, reduces computational load, and enhances model generalizability. The elimination of redundant features through FSLib streamlines the training process, improving efficiency and scalability. This facilitates faster model development and boosts key performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, and recall by focusing on vital features. Moreover, FSLib contributes to data interpretability by revealing important features, aiding in pattern recognition and understanding. Overall, FSLib provides a versatile framework that not only simplifies feature selection but also significantly benefits the machine learning and data mining ecosystem by offering a wide range of algorithms, reducing dimensionality, accelerating model training, improving model outcomes, and enhancing data insights."
1608.07876,Human Action Recognition without Human,"The objective of this paper is to evaluate ""human action recognition without human"". Motion representation is frequently discussed in human action recognition. We have examined several sophisticated options, such as dense trajectories (DT) and the two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN). However, some features from the background could be too strong, as shown in some recent studies on human action recognition. Therefore, we considered whether a background sequence alone can classify human actions in current large-scale action datasets (e.g., UCF101). In this paper, we propose a novel concept for human action analysis that is named ""human action recognition without human"". An experiment clearly shows the effect of a background sequence for understanding an action label."
1609.05672,Multi-Residual Networks: Improving the Speed and Accuracy of Residual   Networks,"In this article, we take one step toward understanding the learning behavior of deep residual networks, and supporting the observation that deep residual networks behave like ensembles. We propose a new convolutional neural network architecture which builds upon the success of residual networks by explicitly exploiting the interpretation of very deep networks as an ensemble. The proposed multi-residual network increases the number of residual functions in the residual blocks. Our architecture generates models that are wider, rather than deeper, which significantly improves accuracy. We show that our model achieves an error rate of 3.73% and 19.45% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively, that outperforms almost all of the existing models. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms very deep residual networks by 0.22% (top-1 error) on the full ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. Additionally, inspired by the parallel structure of multi-residual networks, a model parallelism technique has been investigated. The model parallelism method distributes the computation of residual blocks among the processors, yielding up to 15% computational complexity improvement."
1609.07630,Low-complexity Image and Video Coding Based on an Approximate Discrete   Tchebichef Transform,"The usage of linear transformations has great relevance for data decorrelation applications, like image and video compression. In that sense, the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT) possesses useful coding and decorrelation properties. The DTT transform kernel does not depend on the input data and fast algorithms can be developed to real time applications. However, the DTT fast algorithm presented in literature possess high computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a new low-complexity approximation for the DTT. The fast algorithm of the proposed transform is multiplication-free and requires a reduced number of additions and bit-shifting operations. Image and video compression simulations in popular standards shows good performance of the proposed transform. Regarding hardware resource consumption for FPGA shows 43.1% reduction of configurable logic blocks and ASIC place and route realization shows 57.7% reduction in the area-time figure when compared with the 2-D version of the exact DTT."
1610.00291,Deep Feature Consistent Variational Autoencoder,"We present a novel method for constructing Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Instead of using pixel-by-pixel loss, we enforce deep feature consistency between the input and the output of a VAE, which ensures the VAE's output to preserve the spatial correlation characteristics of the input, thus leading the output to have a more natural visual appearance and better perceptual quality. Based on recent deep learning works such as style transfer, we employ a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and use its hidden features to define a feature perceptual loss for VAE training. Evaluated on the CelebA face dataset, we show that our model produces better results than other methods in the literature. We also show that our method can produce latent vectors that can capture the semantic information of face expressions and can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in facial attribute prediction."
1611.06430,Semi-Supervised Learning with Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial   Networks,"We introduce a simple semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss. Images with random patches removed are presented to a generator whose task is to fill in the hole, based on the surrounding pixels. The in-painted images are then presented to a discriminator network that judges if they are real (unaltered training images) or not. This task acts as a regularizer for standard supervised training of the discriminator. Using our approach we are able to directly train large VGG-style networks in a semi-supervised fashion. We evaluate on STL-10 and PASCAL datasets, where our approach obtains performance comparable or superior to existing methods."
1701.07275,"Universal representations:The missing link between faces, text,   planktons, and cat breeds","With the advent of large labelled datasets and high-capacity models, the performance of machine vision systems has been improving rapidly. However, the technology has still major limitations, starting from the fact that different vision problems are still solved by different models, trained from scratch or fine-tuned on the target data. The human visual system, in stark contrast, learns a universal representation for vision in the early life of an individual. This representation works well for an enormous variety of vision problems, with little or no change, with the major advantage of requiring little training data to solve any of them. In this paper we investigate whether neural networks may work as universal representations by studying their capacity in relation to the âsizeâ of a large combination of vision problems. We do so by showing that a single neural network can learn simultaneously several very different visual domains (from sketches to planktons and MNIST digits) as well as, or better than, a number of specialized networks. However, we also show that this requires to carefully normalize the information in the network, by using domain-specific scaling factors or, more generically, by using an instance normalization layer."
1705.01809,Pixel Normalization from Numeric Data as Input to Neural Networks,"Text to image transformation for input to neural networks requires intermediate steps. This paper attempts to present a new approach to pixel normalization so as to convert textual data into image, suitable as input for neural networks. This method can be further improved by its Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementation to provide significant speedup in computational time."
1705.06011,PaMM: Pose-aware Multi-shot Matching for Improving Person   Re-identification,"Person re-identification is the problem of recognizing people across different images or videos with non-overlapping views. Although there has been much progress in person re-identification over the last decade, it remains a challenging task because appearances of people can seem extremely different across diverse camera viewpoints and person poses. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for person re-identification by analyzing camera viewpoints and person poses in a so-called Pose-aware Multi-shot Matching (PaMM), which robustly estimates people's poses and efficiently conducts multi-shot matching based on pose information. Experimental results using public person re-identification datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods and are promising for person re-identification from diverse viewpoints and pose variances."
1705.09369,Unsupervised Feature Learning for Writer Identification and Writer   Retrieval,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown great success in supervised classification tasks such as character classification or dating. Deep learning methods typically need a lot of annotated training data, which is not available in many scenarios. In these cases, traditional methods are often better than or equivalent to deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective, way to learn CNN activation features in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, we train a deep residual network using surrogate classes. The surrogate classes are created by clustering the training dataset, where each cluster index represents one surrogate class. The activations from the penultimate CNN layer serve as features for subsequent classification tasks. We evaluate the feature representations on two publicly available datasets. The focus lies on the ICDAR17 competition dataset on historical document writer identification (Historical-WI). We show that the activation features trained without supervision are superior to descriptors of state-of-the-art writer identification methods. Additionally, we achieve comparable results in the case of handwriting classification using the ICFHR16 competition dataset on historical Latin script types (CLaMM16)."
1705.10915,Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations from Video,"We present a new model DrNET that learns disentangled image representations from video. Our approach leverages the temporal coherence of video and a novel adversarial loss to learn a representation that factorizes each frame into a stationary part and a temporally varying component. The disentangled representation can be used for a range of tasks. For example, applying a standard LSTM to the time-vary components enables prediction of future frames. We evaluate our approach on a range of synthetic and real videos, demonstrating the ability to coherently generate hundreds of steps into the future."
1707.09933,Learning Neural Network Classifiers with Low Model Complexity,"Modern neural network architectures for large-scale learning tasks have substantially higher model complexities, which makes understanding, visualizing and training these architectures difficult. Recent contributions to deep learning techniques have focused on architectural modifications to improve parameter efficiency and performance. In this paper, we derive a continuous and differentiable error functional for a neural network that minimizes its empirical error as well as a measure of the model complexity. The latter measure is obtained by deriving a differentiable upper bound on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the classifier layer of a class of deep networks. Using standard backpropagation, we realize a training rule that tries to minimize the error on training samples, while improving generalization by keeping the model complexity low. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation (the Low Complexity Neural Network - LCNN) across several deep learning algorithms, and a variety of large benchmark datasets. We show that hidden layer neurons in the resultant networks learn features that are crisp, and in the case of image datasets, quantitatively sharper. Our proposed approach yields benefits across a wide range of architectures, in comparison to and in conjunction with methods such as Dropout and Batch Normalization, and our results strongly suggest that deep learning techniques can benefit from model complexity control methods such as the LCNN learning rule."
1708.09684,Boosting with Lexicographic Programming: Addressing Class Imbalance   without Cost Tuning,"A large amount of research effort has been dedicated to adapting boosting for imbalanced classification. However, boosting methods are yet to be satisfactorily immune to class imbalance, especially for multi-class problems. This is because most of the existing solutions for handling class imbalance rely on expensive cost set tuning for determining the proper level of compensation. We show that the assignment of weights to the component classifiers of a boosted ensemble can be thought of as a game of Tug of War between the classes in the margin space. We then demonstrate how this insight can be used to attain a good compromise between the rare and abundant classes without having to resort to cost set tuning, which has long been the norm for imbalanced classification. The solution is based on a lexicographic linear programming framework which requires two stages. Initially, class-specific component weight combinations are found so as to minimize a hinge loss individually for each of the classes. Subsequently, the final component weights are assigned so that the maximum deviation from the class-specific minimum loss values (obtained in the previous stage) is minimized. Hence, the proposal is not only restricted to two-class situations, but is also readily applicable to multi-class problems. Additionally,we also derive the dual formulation corresponding to the proposed framework. Experiments conducted on artificial and real-world imbalanced datasets as well as on challenging applications such as hyperspectral image classification and ImageNet classification establish the efficacy of the proposal."
1709.01062,A hierarchical loss and its problems when classifying non-hierarchically,"Failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper should be worse and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle; after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing metrics of failure (so-called ""loss"" or ""win"") used in textual or visual classification/recognition via neural networks seldom leverage a-priori information, such as a sheepdog being more similar to a poodle than to a skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a classifier's classes. An ultrametric tree is a tree with a so-called ultrametric distance metric such that all leaves are at the same distance from the root. Unfortunately, extensive numerical experiments indicate that the standard practice of training neural networks via stochastic gradient descent with random starting points often drives down the hierarchical loss nearly as much when minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss as when trying to minimize the hierarchical loss directly. Thus, this hierarchical loss is unreliable as an objective for plain, randomly started stochastic gradient descent to minimize; the main value of the hierarchical loss may be merely as a meaningful metric of success of a classifier."
1710.00983,Joint Person Re-identification and Camera Network Topology Inference in   Multiple Cameras,"Person re-identification is the task of recognizing or identifying a person across multiple views in multi-camera networks. Although there has been much progress in person re-identification, person re-identification in large-scale multi-camera networks still remains a challenging task because of the large spatio-temporal uncertainty and high complexity due to a large number of cameras and people. To handle these difficulties, additional information such as camera network topology should be provided, which is also difficult to automatically estimate, unfortunately. In this study, we propose a unified framework which jointly solves both person re-identification and camera network topology inference problems with minimal prior knowledge about the environments. The proposed framework takes general multi-camera network environments into account and can be applied to online person re-identification in large-scale multi-camera networks. In addition, to effectively show the superiority of the proposed framework, we provide a new person re-identification dataset with full annotations, named SLP, captured in the multi-camera network consisting of nine non-overlapping cameras. Experimental results using our person re-identification and public datasets show that the proposed methods are promising for both person re-identification and camera topology inference tasks."
1710.05267,MR fingerprinting Deep RecOnstruction NEtwork (DRONE),"PURPOSE: Demonstrate a novel fast method for reconstruction of multi-dimensional MR Fingerprinting (MRF) data using Deep Learning methods.   METHODS: A neural network (NN) is defined using the TensorFlow framework and trained on simulated MRF data computed using the Bloch equations. The accuracy of the NN reconstruction of noisy data is compared to conventional MRF template matching as a function of training data size, and quantified in a both simulated numerical brain phantom data and acquired data from the ISMRM/NIST phantom. The utility of the method is demonstrated in a healthy subject in vivo at 1.5 T.   RESULTS: Network training required 10 minutes and once trained, data reconstruction required approximately 10 ms. Reconstruction of simulated brain data using the NN resulted in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 ms for T1 and 7.8 ms for T2. The RMSE for the NN trained on sparse dictionaries was approximately 6 fold lower for T1 and 2 fold lower for T2 than conventional MRF dot-product dictionary matching on the same dictionaries. Phantom measurements yielded good agreement (R2=0.99) between the T1 and T2 estimated by the NN and reference values from the ISMRM/NIST phantom.   CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of MRF data with a NN is accurate, 300 fold faster and more robust to noise and undersampling than conventional MRF dictionary matching."
1710.05512,The Feeling of Success: Does Touch Sensing Help Predict Grasp Outcomes?,"A successful grasp requires careful balancing of the contact forces. Deducing whether a particular grasp will be successful from indirect measurements, such as vision, is therefore quite challenging, and direct sensing of contacts through touch sensing provides an appealing avenue toward more successful and consistent robotic grasping. However, in order to fully evaluate the value of touch sensing for grasp outcome prediction, we must understand how touch sensing can influence outcome prediction accuracy when combined with other modalities. Doing so using conventional model-based techniques is exceptionally difficult. In this work, we investigate the question of whether touch sensing aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing framework that combines vision and touch. To that end, we collected more than 9,000 grasping trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network models to directly predict grasp outcomes from either modality individually, and from both modalities together. Our experimental results indicate that incorporating tactile readings substantially improve grasping performance."
1712.00158,Distance-based Camera Network Topology Inference for Person   Re-identification,"In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based camera network topology inference method for efficient person re-identification. To this end, we first calibrate each camera and estimate relative scales between cameras. Using the calibration results of multiple cameras, we calculate the speed of each person and infer the distance between cameras to generate distance-based camera network topology. The proposed distance-based topology can be applied adaptively to each person according to its speed and handle diverse transition time of people between non-overlapping cameras. To validate the proposed method, we tested the proposed method using an open person re-identification dataset and compared to state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for person re-identification in the large-scale camera network with various people transition time."
1712.00427,Unsupervised Classification of PolSAR Data Using a Scattering Similarity Measure Derived from a Geodesic Distance,"In this letter, we propose a novel technique for obtaining scattering components from Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data using the geodesic distance on the unit sphere. This geodesic distance is obtained between an elementary target and the observed Kennaugh matrix, and it is further utilized to compute a similarity measure between scattering mechanisms. The normalized similarity measure for each elementary target is then modulated with the total scattering power (Span). This measure is used to categorize pixels into three categories i.e. odd-bounce, double-bounce and volume, depending on which of the above scattering mechanisms dominate. Then the maximum likelihood classifier of [J.-S. Lee, M. R. Grunes, E. Pottier, and L. Ferro-Famil, Unsupervised terrain classification preserving polarimetric scattering characteristics, IEEE Trans. Geos. Rem. Sens., vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 722731, April 2004.] based on the complex Wishart distribution is iteratively used for each category. Dominant scattering mechanisms are thus preserved in this classification scheme. We show results for L-band AIRSAR and ALOS-2 datasets acquired over San Francisco and Mumbai, respectively. The scattering mechanisms are better preserved using the proposed methodology than the unsupervised classification results using the Freeman-Durden scattering powers on an orientation angle (OA) corrected PolSAR image. Furthermore, (1) the scattering similarity is a completely non-negative quantity unlike the negative powers that might occur in double- bounce and odd-bounce scattering component under Freeman Durden decomposition (FDD), and (2) the methodology can be extended to more canonical targets as well as for bistatic scattering."
1712.00960,FSSD: Feature Fusion Single Shot Multibox Detector,"SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) is one of the best object detection algorithms with both high accuracy and fast speed. However, SSD's feature pyramid detection method makes it hard to fuse the features from different scales. In this paper, we proposed FSSD (Feature Fusion Single Shot Multibox Detector), an enhanced SSD with a novel and lightweight feature fusion module which can improve the performance significantly over SSD with just a little speed drop. In the feature fusion module, features from different layers with different scales are concatenated together, followed by some down-sampling blocks to generate new feature pyramid, which will be fed to multibox detectors to predict the final detection results. On the Pascal VOC 2007 test, our network can achieve 82.7 mAP (mean average precision) at the speed of 65.8 FPS (frame per second) with the input size 300$\times$300 using a single Nvidia 1080Ti GPU. In addition, our result on COCO is also better than the conventional SSD with a large margin. Our FSSD outperforms a lot of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms in both aspects of accuracy and speed. Code is available at https://github.com/lzx1413/CAFFE_SSD/tree/fssd."
1801.01451,Reducing Deep Network Complexity via Sparse Hierarchical Fourier   Interaction Networks,"This paper presents a Sparse Hierarchical Fourier Interaction Networks, an architectural building block that unifies three complementary principles of frequency domain modeling: A hierarchical patch wise Fourier transform that affords simultaneous access to local detail and global context; A learnable, differentiable top K masking mechanism which retains only the most informative spectral coefficients, thereby exploiting the natural compressibility of visual and linguistic signals."
1802.03494,AMC: AutoML for Model Compression and Acceleration on Mobile Devices,"Model compression is a critical technique to efficiently deploy neural network models on mobile devices which have limited computation resources and tight power budgets. Conventional model compression techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics and rule-based policies that require domain experts to explore the large design space trading off among model size, speed, and accuracy, which is usually sub-optimal and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoML for Model Compression (AMC) which leverage reinforcement learning to provide the model compression policy. This learning-based compression policy outperforms conventional rule-based compression policy by having higher compression ratio, better preserving the accuracy and freeing human labor. Under 4x FLOPs reduction, we achieved 2.7% better accuracy than the handcrafted model compression policy for VGG-16 on ImageNet. We applied this automated, push-the-button compression pipeline to MobileNet and achieved 1.81x speedup of measured inference latency on an Android phone and 1.43x speedup on the Titan XP GPU, with only 0.1% loss of ImageNet Top-1 accuracy."
1802.07687,Stochastic Video Generation with a Learned Prior,"Generating video frames that accurately predict future world states is challenging. Existing approaches either fail to capture the full distribution of outcomes, or yield blurry generations, or both. In this paper we introduce an unsupervised video generation model that learns a prior model of uncertainty in a given environment. Video frames are generated by drawing samples from this prior and combining them with a deterministic estimate of the future frame. The approach is simple and easily trained end-to-end on a variety of datasets. Sample generations are both varied and sharp, even many frames into the future, and compare favorably to those from existing approaches."
1803.03724,Contour Parametrization via Anisotropic Mean Curvature Flows,"We present a new implementation of anisotropic mean curvature flow for contour recognition. Our procedure couples the mean curvature flow of planar closed smooth curves, with an external field from a potential of point-wise charges. This coupling constrains the motion when the curve matches a picture placed as background. We include a stability criteria for our numerical approximation."
1803.10683,Pose2Seg: Detection Free Human Instance Segmentation,"The standard approach to image instance segmentation is to perform the object detection first, and then segment the object from the detection bounding-box. More recently, deep learning methods like Mask R-CNN perform them jointly. However, little research takes into account the uniqueness of the ""human"" category, which can be well defined by the pose skeleton. Moreover, the human pose skeleton can be used to better distinguish instances with heavy occlusion than using bounding-boxes. In this paper, we present a brand new pose-based instance segmentation framework for humans which separates instances based on human pose, rather than proposal region detection. We demonstrate that our pose-based framework can achieve better accuracy than the state-of-art detection-based approach on the human instance segmentation problem, and can moreover better handle occlusion. Furthermore, there are few public datasets containing many heavily occluded humans along with comprehensive annotations, which makes this a challenging problem seldom noticed by researchers. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a new benchmark ""Occluded Human (OCHuman)"", which focuses on occluded humans with comprehensive annotations including bounding-box, human pose and instance masks. This dataset contains 8110 detailed annotated human instances within 4731 images. With an average 0.67 MaxIoU for each person, OCHuman is the most complex and challenging dataset related to human instance segmentation. Through this dataset, we want to emphasize occlusion as a challenging problem for researchers to study."
1804.06291,Efficient Solvers for Sparse Subspace Clustering,"Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) clusters $n$ points that lie near a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The SSC model expresses each point as a linear or affine combination of the other points, using either $\ell_1$ or $\ell_0$ regularization. Using $\ell_1$ regularization results in a convex problem but requires $O(n^2)$ storage, and is typically solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers which takes $O(n^3)$ flops. The $\ell_0$ model is non-convex but only needs memory linear in $n$, and is solved via orthogonal matching pursuit and cannot handle the case of affine subspaces. This paper shows that a proximal gradient framework can solve SSC, covering both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$ models, and both linear and affine constraints. For both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$, algorithms to compute the proximity operator in the presence of affine constraints have not been presented in the SSC literature, so we derive an exact and efficient algorithm that solves the $\ell_1$ case with just $O(n^2)$ flops. In the $\ell_0$ case, our algorithm retains the low-memory overhead, and is the first algorithm to solve the SSC-$\ell_0$ model with affine constraints. Experiments show our algorithms do not rely on sensitive regularization parameters, and they are less sensitive to sparsity misspecification and high noise."
1804.11142,Evolution of Visual Odometry Techniques,"With rapid advancements in the area of mobile robotics and industrial automation, a growing need has arisen towards accurate navigation and localization of moving objects. Camera based motion estimation is one such technique which is gaining huge popularity owing to its simplicity and use of limited resources in generating motion path. In this paper, an attempt is made to introduce this topic for beginners covering different aspects of vision based motion estimation task. The evolution of VO schemes over last few decades is discussed under two broad categories, that is, geometric and non-geometric approaches. The geometric approaches are further detailed under three different classes, that is, feature-based, appearance-based, and a hybrid of feature and appearance based schemes. The non-geometric approach is one of the recent paradigm shift from conventional pose estimation technique and is thus discussed in a separate section. Towards the end, a list of different datasets for visual odometry and allied research areas are provided for a ready reference."
1805.04487,Non-Stationary Texture Synthesis by Adversarial Expansion,"The real world exhibits an abundance of non-stationary textures. Examples include textures with large-scale structures, as well as spatially variant and inhomogeneous textures. While existing example-based texture synthesis methods can cope well with stationary textures, non-stationary textures still pose a considerable challenge, which remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach for example-based non-stationary texture synthesis. Our approach uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), trained to double the spatial extent of texture blocks extracted from a specific texture exemplar. Once trained, the fully convolutional generator is able to expand the size of the entire exemplar, as well as of any of its sub-blocks. We demonstrate that this conceptually simple approach is highly effective for capturing large-scale structures, as well as other non-stationary attributes of the input exemplar. As a result, it can cope with challenging textures, which, to our knowledge, no other existing method can handle."
1806.10866,Exploring Architectures for CNN-Based Word Spotting,"The goal in word spotting is to retrieve parts of document images which are relevant with respect to a certain user-defined query. The recent past has seen attribute-based Convolutional Neural Networks take over this field of research. As is common for other fields of computer vision, the CNNs used for this task are already considerably deep. The question that arises, however, is: How complex does a CNN have to be for word spotting? Are increasingly deeper models giving increasingly better results or does performance behave asymptotically for these architectures? On the other hand, can similar results be obtained with a much smaller CNN? The goal of this paper is to give an answer to these questions. Therefore, the recently successful TPP-PHOCNet will be compared to a Residual Network, a Densely Connected Convolutional Network and a LeNet architecture empirically. As will be seen in the evaluation, a complex model can be beneficial for word spotting on harder tasks such as the IAM Offline Database but gives no advantage for easier benchmarks such as the George Washington Database."
1807.02323,Optimal Sensor Data Fusion Architecture for Object Detection in Adverse   Weather Conditions,"A good and robust sensor data fusion in diverse weather conditions is a quite challenging task. There are several fusion architectures in the literature, e.g. the sensor data can be fused right at the beginning (Early Fusion), or they can be first processed separately and then concatenated later (Late Fusion). In this work, different fusion architectures are compared and evaluated by means of object detection tasks, in which the goal is to recognize and localize predefined objects in a stream of data. Usually, state-of-the-art object detectors based on neural networks are highly optimized for good weather conditions, since the well-known benchmarks only consist of sensor data recorded in optimal weather conditions. Therefore, the performance of these approaches decreases enormously or even fails in adverse weather conditions. In this work, different sensor fusion architectures are compared for good and adverse weather conditions for finding the optimal fusion architecture for diverse weather situations. A new training strategy is also introduced such that the performance of the object detector is greatly enhanced in adverse weather scenarios or if a sensor fails. Furthermore, the paper responds to the question if the detection accuracy can be increased further by providing the neural network with a-priori knowledge such as the spatial calibration of the sensors."
1807.03142,Faster Bounding Box Annotation for Object Detection in Indoor Scenes,"This paper proposes an approach for rapid bounding box annotation for object detection datasets. The procedure consists of two stages: The first step is to annotate a part of the dataset manually, and the second step proposes annotations for the remaining samples using a model trained with the first stage annotations. We experimentally study which first/second stage split minimizes to total workload. In addition, we introduce a new fully labeled object detection dataset collected from indoor scenes. Compared to other indoor datasets, our collection has more class categories, different backgrounds, lighting conditions, occlusion and high intra-class differences. We train deep learning based object detectors with a number of state-of-the-art models and compare them in terms of speed and accuracy. The fully annotated dataset is released freely available for the research community."
1807.10027,A Tensor Factorization Method for 3D Super-Resolution with Application   to Dental CT,"Available super-resolution techniques for 3D images are either computationally inefficient prior-knowledge-based iterative techniques or deep learning methods which require a large database of known low- and high-resolution image pairs. A recently introduced tensor-factorization-based approach offers a fast solution without the use of known image pairs or strict prior assumptions. In this article this factorization framework is investigated for single image resolution enhancement with an off-line estimate of the system point spread function. The technique is applied to 3D cone beam computed tomography for dental image resolution enhancement. To demonstrate the efficiency of our method, it is compared to a recent state-of-the-art iterative technique using low-rank and total variation regularizations. In contrast to this comparative technique, the proposed reconstruction technique gives a 2-order-of-magnitude improvement in running time -- 2 minutes compared to 2 hours for a dental volume of 282$\times$266$\times$392 voxels. Furthermore, it also offers slightly improved quantitative results (peak signal-to-noise ratio, segmentation quality). Another advantage of the presented technique is the low number of hyperparameters. As demonstrated in this paper, the framework is not sensitive to small changes of its parameters, proposing an ease of use."
1807.10108,Effects of Degradations on Deep Neural Network Architectures,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have massively influenced recent advances in large-scale image classification. More recently, a dynamic routing algorithm with capsules (groups of neurons) has shown state-of-the-art recognition performance. However, the behavior of such networks in the presence of a degrading signal (noise) is mostly unexplored. An analytical study on different network architectures toward noise robustness is essential for selecting the appropriate model in a specific application scenario. This paper presents an extensive performance analysis of six deep architectures for image classification on six most common image degradation models. In this study, we have compared VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, MobileNet and CapsuleNet architectures on Gaussian white, Gaussian color, salt-and-pepper, Gaussian blur, motion blur and JPEG compression noise models."
1807.10441,Synthetically Trained Icon Proposals for Parsing and Summarizing   Infographics,"Widely used in news, business, and educational media, infographics are handcrafted to effectively communicate messages about complex and often abstract topics including `ways to conserve the environment' and `understanding the financial crisis'. Composed of stylistically and semantically diverse visual and textual elements, infographics pose new challenges for computer vision. While automatic text extraction works well on infographics, computer vision approaches trained on natural images fail to identify the stand-alone visual elements in infographics, or `icons'. To bridge this representation gap, we propose a synthetic data generation strategy: we augment background patches in infographics from our Visually29K dataset with Internet-scraped icons which we use as training data for an icon proposal mechanism. On a test set of 1K annotated infographics, icons are located with 38% precision and 34% recall (the best model trained with natural images achieves 14% precision and 7% recall). Combining our icon proposals with icon classification and text extraction, we present a multi-modal summarization application. Our application takes an infographic as input and automatically produces text tags and visual hashtags that are textually and visually representative of the infographic's topics respectively."
1808.00601,Classification of Building Information Model (BIM) Structures with Deep   Learning,"In this work we study an application of machine learning to the construction industry and we use classical and modern machine learning methods to categorize images of building designs into three classes: Apartment building, Industrial building or Other. No real images are used, but only images extracted from Building Information Model (BIM) software, as these are used by the construction industry to store building designs. For this task, we compared four different methods: the first is based on classical machine learning, where Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) was used for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification; the other three methods are based on deep learning, covering common pre-trained networks as well as ones designed from scratch. To validate the accuracy of the models, a database of 240 images was used. The accuracy achieved is 57% for the HOG + SVM model, and above 89% for the neural networks."
1808.01356,Deep Learning-Based Multiple Object Visual Tracking on Embedded System   for IoT and Mobile Edge Computing Applications,"Compute and memory demands of state-of-the-art deep learning methods are still a shortcoming that must be addressed to make them useful at IoT end-nodes. In particular, recent results depict a hopeful prospect for image processing using Convolutional Neural Netwoks, CNNs, but the gap between software and hardware implementations is already considerable for IoT and mobile edge computing applications due to their high power consumption. This proposal performs low-power and real time deep learning-based multiple object visual tracking implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development kit. It includes a camera and wireless connection capability and it is battery powered for mobile and outdoor applications. A collection of representative sequences captured with the on-board camera, dETRUSC video dataset, is used to exemplify the performance of the proposed algorithm and to facilitate benchmarking. The results in terms of power consumption and frame rate demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning algorithms on embedded platforms although more effort to joint algorithm and hardware design of CNNs is needed."
1808.02357,Acoustic Scene Classification: A Competition Review,"In this paper we study the problem of acoustic scene classification, i.e., categorization of audio sequences into mutually exclusive classes based on their spectral content. We describe the methods and results discovered during a competition organized in the context of a graduate machine learning course; both by the students and external participants. We identify the most suitable methods and study the impact of each by performing an ablation study of the mixture of approaches. We also compare the results with a neural network baseline, and show the improvement over that. Finally, we discuss the impact of using a competition as a part of a university course, and justify its importance in the curriculum based on student feedback."
1809.01701,Pack and Detect: Fast Object Detection in Videos Using   Region-of-Interest Packing,"Object detection in videos is an important task in computer vision for various applications such as object tracking, video summarization and video search. Although great progress has been made in improving the accuracy of object detection in recent years due to the rise of deep neural networks, the state-of-the-art algorithms are highly computationally intensive. In order to address this challenge, we make two important observations in the context of videos: (i) Objects often occupy only a small fraction of the area in each video frame, and (ii) There is a high likelihood of strong temporal correlation between consecutive frames. Based on these observations, we propose Pack and Detect (PaD), an approach to reduce the computational requirements of object detection in videos. In PaD, only selected video frames called anchor frames are processed at full size. In the frames that lie between anchor frames (inter-anchor frames), regions of interest (ROIs) are identified based on the detections in the previous frame. We propose an algorithm to pack the ROIs of each inter-anchor frame together into a reduced-size frame. The computational requirements of the detector are reduced due to the lower size of the input. In order to maintain the accuracy of object detection, the proposed algorithm expands the ROIs greedily to provide additional background around each object to the detector. PaD can use any underlying neural network architecture to process the full-size and reduced-size frames. Experiments using the ImageNet video object detection dataset indicate that PaD can potentially reduce the number of FLOPS required for a frame by $4\times$. This leads to an overall increase in throughput of $1.25\times$ on a 2.1 GHz Intel Xeon server with a NVIDIA Titan X GPU at the cost of $1.1\%$ drop in accuracy."
1809.05955,3D Path Planning from a Single 2D Fluoroscopic Image for Robot Assisted   Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair,"The current standard of intra-operative navigation during Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) calls for need of 3D alignments between inserted devices and aortic branches. The navigation commonly via 2D fluoroscopic images, lacks anatomical information, resulting in longer operation hours and radiation exposure. In this paper, a framework for real-time 3D robotic path planning from a single 2D fluoroscopic image of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is introduced. A graph matching method is proposed to establish the correspondence between the 3D preoperative and 2D intra-operative AAA skeletons, and then the two skeletons are registered by skeleton deformation and regularization in respect to skeleton length and smoothness. Furthermore, deep learning was used to segment 3D pre-operative AAA from Computed Tomography (CT) scans to facilitate the framework automation. Simulation, phantom and patient AAA data sets have been used to validate the proposed framework. 3D distance error of 2mm was achieved in the phantom setup. Performance advantages were also achieved in terms of accuracy, robustness and time-efficiency. All the code will be open source."
1809.09607,Semantic and structural image segmentation for prosthetic vision,"Prosthetic vision is being applied to partially recover the retinal stimulation of visually impaired people. However, the phosphenic images produced by the implants have very limited information bandwidth due to the poor resolution and lack of color or contrast. The ability of object recognition and scene understanding in real environments is severely restricted for prosthetic users. Computer vision can play a key role to overcome the limitations and to optimize the visual information in the simulated prosthetic vision, improving the amount of information that is presented. We present a new approach to build a schematic representation of indoor environments for phosphene images. The proposed method combines a variety of convolutional neural networks for extracting and conveying relevant information about the scene such as structural informative edges of the environment and silhouettes of segmented objects. Experiments were conducted with normal sighted subjects with a Simulated Prosthetic Vision system. The results show good accuracy for object recognition and room identification tasks for indoor scenes using the proposed approach, compared to other image processing methods."
1810.02897,CDF Transform-and-Shift: An effective way to deal with datasets of   inhomogeneous cluster densities,"The problem of inhomogeneous cluster densities has been a long-standing issue for distance-based and density-based algorithms in clustering and anomaly detection. These algorithms implicitly assume that all clusters have approximately the same density. As a result, they often exhibit a bias towards dense clusters in the presence of sparse clusters. Many remedies have been suggested; yet, we show that they are partial solutions which do not address the issue satisfactorily. To match the implicit assumption, we propose to transform a given dataset such that the transformed clusters have approximately the same density while all regions of locally low density become globally low density -- homogenising cluster density while preserving the cluster structure of the dataset. We show that this can be achieved by using a new multi-dimensional Cumulative Distribution Function in a transform-and-shift method. The method can be applied to every dataset, before the dataset is used in many existing algorithms to match their implicit assumption without algorithmic modification. We show that the proposed method performs better than existing remedies."
1810.05420,Cryo-CARE: Content-Aware Image Restoration for Cryo-Transmission   Electron Microscopy Data,"Multiple approaches to use deep learning for image restoration have recently been proposed. Training such approaches requires well registered pairs of high and low quality images. While this is easily achievable for many imaging modalities, e.g. fluorescence light microscopy, for others it is not. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) could profoundly benefit from improved denoising methods, unfortunately it is one of the latter. Here we show how recent advances in network training for image restoration tasks, i.e. denoising, can be applied to cryo-TEM data. We describe our proposed method and show how it can be applied to single cryo-TEM projections and whole cryo-tomographic image volumes. Our proposed restoration method dramatically increases contrast in cryo-TEM images, which improves the interpretability of the acquired data. Furthermore we show that automated downstream processing on restored image data, demonstrated on a dense segmentation task, leads to improved results."
1810.06612,Learning to Segment Corneal Tissue Interfaces in OCT Images,"Accurate and repeatable delineation of corneal tissue interfaces is necessary for surgical planning during anterior segment interventions, such as Keratoplasty. Designing an approach to identify interfaces, which generalizes to datasets acquired from different Optical Coherence Tomographic (OCT) scanners, is paramount. In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework called CorNet that can accurately segment three corneal interfaces across datasets obtained with different scan settings from different OCT scanners. Extensive validation of the approach was conducted across all imaged datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning based approach to segment both anterior and posterior corneal tissue interfaces. Our errors are 2x lower than non-proprietary state-of-the-art corneal tissue interface segmentation algorithms, which include image analysis-based and deep learning approaches."
1810.07746,A Convolutional Autoencoder Approach to Learn Volumetric Shape   Representations for Brain Structures,"We propose a novel machine learning strategy for studying neuroanatomical shape variation. Our model works with volumetric binary segmentation images, and requires no pre-processing such as the extraction of surface points or a mesh. The learned shape descriptor is invariant to affine transformations, including shifts, rotations and scaling. Thanks to the adopted autoencoder framework, inter-subject differences are automatically enhanced in the learned representation, while intra-subject variances are minimized. Our experimental results on a shape retrieval task showed that the proposed representation outperforms a state-of-the-art benchmark for brain structures extracted from MRI scans."
1810.08774,Improved Techniques for GAN based Facial Inpainting,"In this paper we present several architectural and optimization recipes for generative adversarial network(GAN) based facial semantic inpainting. Current benchmark models are susceptible to initial solutions of non-convex optimization criterion of GAN based inpainting. We present an end-to-end trainable parametric network to deterministically start from good initial solutions leading to more photo realistic reconstructions with significant optimization speed up. For the first time, we show how to efficiently extend GAN based single image inpainter models to sequences by a)learning to initialize a temporal window of solutions with a recurrent neural network and b)imposing a temporal smoothness loss(during iterative optimization) to respect the redundancy in temporal dimension of a sequence. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations on CelebA images and pseudo sequences followed by real life videos of VidTIMIT dataset. The proposed method significantly outperforms current GAN based state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality with a simultaneous speedup of over 15$\times$. We also show that our proposed model is better in preserving facial identity in a sequence even without explicitly using any face recognition module during training."
1810.12813,Contextual Hourglass Network for Semantic Segmentation of High   Resolution Aerial Imagery,"Semantic segmentation for aerial imagery is a challenging and important problem in remotely sensed imagery analysis. In recent years, with the success of deep learning, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have been developed. However, due to the varying sizes of the objects and imbalanced class labels, it can be challenging to obtain accurate pixel-wise semantic segmentation results. To address those challenges, we develop a novel semantic segmentation method and call it Contextual Hourglass Network. In our method, in order to improve the robustness of the prediction, we design a new contextual hourglass module which incorporates attention mechanism on processed low-resolution featuremaps to exploit the contextual semantics. We further exploit the stacked encoder-decoder structure by connecting multiple contextual hourglass modules from end to end. This architecture can effectively extract rich multi-scale features and add more feedback loops for better learning contextual semantics through intermediate supervision. To demonstrate the efficacy of our semantic segmentation method, we test it on Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets. Through the comparisons to other baseline methods, our method yields the best results on overall performance."
1811.04661,RelDenClu: A Relative Density based Biclustering Method for identifying   non-linear feature relations,"The existing biclustering algorithms for finding feature relation based biclusters often depend on assumptions like monotonicity or linearity. Though a few algorithms overcome this problem by using density-based methods, they tend to miss out many biclusters because they use global criteria for identifying dense regions. The proposed method, RelDenClu uses the local variations in marginal and joint densities for each pair of features to find the subset of observations, which forms the bases of the relation between them. It then finds the set of features connected by a common set of observations, resulting in a bicluster.   To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, experimentation has been carried out on fifteen types of simulated datasets. Further, it has been applied to six real-life datasets. For three of these real-life datasets, the proposed method is used for unsupervised learning, while for other three real-life datasets it is used as an aid to supervised learning. For all the datasets the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of seven different state-of-the-art algorithms and the proposed algorithm is seen to produce better results. The efficacy of proposed algorithm is also seen by its use on COVID-19 dataset for identifying some features (genetic, demographics and others) that are likely to affect the spread of COVID-19."
1811.06295,Selective Feature Connection Mechanism: Concatenating Multi-layer CNN   Features with a Feature Selector,"Different layers of deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) can encode different-level information. High-layer features always contain more semantic information, and low-layer features contain more detail information. However, low-layer features suffer from the background clutter and semantic ambiguity. During visual recognition, the feature combination of the low-layer and high-level features plays an important role in context modulation. If directly combining the high-layer and low-layer features, the background clutter and semantic ambiguity may be caused due to the introduction of detailed information. In this paper, we propose a general network architecture to concatenate CNN features of different layers in a simple and effective way, called Selective Feature Connection Mechanism (SFCM). Low-level features are selectively linked to high-level features with a feature selector which is generated by high-level features. The proposed connection mechanism can effectively overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority, and universal applicability of this method on multiple challenging computer vision tasks, including image classification, scene text detection, and image-to-image translation."
1811.08075,Scene Graph Generation via Conditional Random Fields,"Despite the great success object detection and segmentation models have achieved in recognizing individual objects in images, performance on cognitive tasks such as image caption, semantic image retrieval, and visual QA is far from satisfactory. To achieve better performance on these cognitive tasks, merely recognizing individual object instances is insufficient. Instead, the interactions between object instances need to be captured in order to facilitate reasoning and understanding of the visual scenes in an image. Scene graph, a graph representation of images that captures object instances and their relationships, offers a comprehensive understanding of an image. However, existing techniques on scene graph generation fail to distinguish subjects and objects in the visual scenes of images and thus do not perform well with real-world datasets where exist ambiguous object instances. In this work, we propose a novel scene graph generation model for predicting object instances and its corresponding relationships in an image. Our model, SG-CRF, learns the sequential order of subject and object in a relationship triplet, and the semantic compatibility of object instance nodes and relationship nodes in a scene graph efficiently. Experiments empirically show that SG-CRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, on three different datasets, i.e., CLEVR, VRD, and Visual Genome, raising the Recall@100 from 24.99% to 49.95%, from 41.92% to 50.47%, and from 54.69% to 54.77%, respectively."
1812.00352,MDU-Net: Multi-scale Densely Connected U-Net for biomedical image   segmentation,"Biomedical image segmentation plays a central role in quantitative analysis, clinical diagnosis, and medical intervention. In the light of the fully convolutional networks (FCN) and U-Net, deep convolutional networks (DNNs) have made significant contributions to biomedical image segmentation applications. In this paper, we propose three different multi-scale dense connections (MDC) for the encoder, the decoder of U-shaped architectures, and across them. Based on three dense connections, we propose a multi-scale densely connected U-Net (MDU-Net) for biomedical image segmentation. MDU-Net directly fuses the neighboring feature maps with different scales from both higher layers and lower layers to strengthen feature propagation in the current layer. Multi-scale dense connections, which contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and output, also make a much deeper U-Net possible. Besides, we introduce quantization to alleviate the potential overfitting in dense connections, and further improve the segmentation performance. We evaluate our proposed model on the MICCAI 2015 Gland Segmentation (GlaS) dataset. The three MDC improve U-Net performance by up to 1.8% on test A and 3.5% on test B in the MICCAI Gland dataset. Meanwhile, the MDU-Net with quantization obviously improves the segmentation performance of original U-Net."
1812.00725,CRAVES: Controlling Robotic Arm with a Vision-based Economic System,"Training a robotic arm to accomplish real-world tasks has been attracting increasing attention in both academia and industry. This work discusses the role of computer vision algorithms in this field. We focus on low-cost arms on which no sensors are equipped and thus all decisions are made upon visual recognition, e.g., real-time 3D pose estimation. This requires annotating a lot of training data, which is not only time-consuming but also laborious.   In this paper, we present an alternative solution, which uses a 3D model to create a large number of synthetic data, trains a vision model in this virtual domain, and applies it to real-world images after domain adaptation. To this end, we design a semi-supervised approach, which fully leverages the geometric constraints among keypoints. We apply an iterative algorithm for optimization. Without any annotations on real images, our algorithm generalizes well and produces satisfying results on 3D pose estimation, which is evaluated on two real-world datasets. We also construct a vision-based control system for task accomplishment, for which we train a reinforcement learning agent in a virtual environment and apply it to the real-world. Moreover, our approach, with merely a 3D model being required, has the potential to generalize to other types of multi-rigid-body dynamic systems. Website: https://qiuwch.github.io/craves.ai.

1812.01243,Efficient Attention: Attention with Linear Complexities,"Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/cmsflash/efficient-attention."
1812.01973,"VideoMem: Constructing, Analyzing, Predicting Short-term and Long-term   Video Memorability","Humans share a strong tendency to memorize/forget some of the visual information they encounter. This paper focuses on providing computational models for the prediction of the intrinsic memorability of visual content. To address this new challenge, we introduce a large scale dataset (VideoMem) composed of 10,000 videos annotated with memorability scores. In contrast to previous work on image memorability -- where memorability was measured a few minutes after memorization -- memory performance is measured twice: a few minutes after memorization and again 24-72 hours later. Hence, the dataset comes with short-term and long-term memorability annotations. After an in-depth analysis of the dataset, we investigate several deep neural network based models for the prediction of video memorability. Our best model using a ranking loss achieves a Spearman's rank correlation of 0.494 for short-term memorability prediction, while our proposed model with attention mechanism provides insights of what makes a content memorable. The VideoMem dataset with pre-extracted features is publicly available."
1901.02520,Lattice Identification and Separation: Theory and Algorithm,"Motivated by lattice mixture identification and grain boundary detection, we present a framework for lattice pattern representation and comparison, and propose an efficient algorithm for lattice separation. We define new scale and shape descriptors, which helps to considerably reduce the size of equivalence classes of lattice bases. These finitely many equivalence relations are fully characterized by modular group theory. We construct the lattice space $\mathscr{L}$ based on the equivalent descriptors and define a metric $d_{\mathscr{L}}$ to accurately quantify the visual similarities and differences between lattices. Furthermore, we introduce the Lattice Identification and Separation Algorithm (LISA), which identifies each lattice patterns from superposed lattices. LISA finds lattice candidates from the high responses in the image spectrum, then sequentially extracts different layers of lattice patterns one by one. Analyzing the frequency components, we reveal the intricate dependency of LISA's performances on particle radius, lattice density, and relative translations. Various numerical experiments are designed to show LISA's robustness against a large number of lattice layers, moir\'{e} patterns and missing particles."
1901.10415,MgNet: A Unified Framework of Multigrid and Convolutional Neural Network,"We develop a unified model, known as MgNet, that simultaneously recovers some convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification and multigrid (MG) methods for solving discretized partial differential equations (PDEs). This model is based on close connections that we have observed and uncovered between the CNN and MG methodologies. For example, pooling operation and feature extraction in CNN correspond directly to restriction operation and iterative smoothers in MG, respectively. As the solution space is often the dual of the data space in PDEs, the analogous concept of feature space and data space (which are dual to each other) is introduced in CNN. With such connections and new concept in the unified model, the function of various convolution operations and pooling used in CNN can be better understood. As a result, modified CNN models (with fewer weights and hyper parameters) are developed that exhibit competitive and sometimes better performance in comparison with existing CNN models when applied to both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets."
1901.11398,A study on general visual categorization of objects into animal and   plant groups using global shape descriptors with a focus on category-specific   deficits,"How do humans distinguish between general categories of objects? In a number of semantic category deficits, patients are good at making broad categorization but are unable to remember fine and specific details. It has been well accepted that general information about concepts is more robust to damages related to semantic memory. Results from patients with semantic memory disorders demonstrate the loss of ability in subcategory recognition. In this paper, we review the behavioral evidence for category specific disorder and show that general categories of animal and plant are visually distinguishable without processing textural information. To this aim, we utilize shape descriptors with an additional phase of feature learning. The results are evaluated with both supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms and confirm that the proposed method can effectively discriminates between animal and plant object categories in visual domain."
1902.00615,Confidence Trigger Detection: Accelerating Real-time   Tracking-by-detection Systems,"Real-time object tracking necessitates a delicate balance between speed and accuracy, a challenge exacerbated by the computational demands of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Triggered Detection (CTD), an innovative approach that strategically bypasses object detection for frames closely resembling intermediate states, leveraging tracker confidence scores. CTD not only enhances tracking speed but also preserves accuracy, surpassing existing tracking algorithms. Through extensive evaluation across various tracker confidence thresholds, we identify an optimal trade-off between tracking speed and accuracy, providing crucial insights for parameter fine-tuning and enhancing CTD's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our experiments across diverse detection models underscore the robustness and versatility of the CTD framework, demonstrating its potential to enable real-time tracking in resource-constrained environments."
1902.03589,NeurAll: Towards a Unified Visual Perception Model for Automated Driving,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully used for the important automotive visual perception tasks including object recognition, motion and depth estimation, visual SLAM, etc. However, these tasks are typically independently explored and modeled. In this paper, we propose a joint multi-task network design for learning several tasks simultaneously. Our main motivation is the computational efficiency achieved by sharing the expensive initial convolutional layers between all tasks. Indeed, the main bottleneck in automated driving systems is the limited processing power available on deployment hardware. There is also some evidence for other benefits in improving accuracy for some tasks and easing development effort. It also offers scalability to add more tasks leveraging existing features and achieving better generalization. We survey various CNN based solutions for visual perception tasks in automated driving. Then we propose a unified CNN model for the important tasks and discuss several advanced optimization and architecture design techniques to improve the baseline model. The paper is partly review and partly positional with demonstration of several preliminary results promising for future research. We first demonstrate results of multi-stream learning and auxiliary learning which are important ingredients to scale to a large multi-task model. Finally, we implement a two-stream three-task network which performs better in many cases compared to their corresponding single-task models, while maintaining network size."
1902.06634,Contextual Encoder-Decoder Network for Visual Saliency Prediction,"Predicting salient regions in natural images requires the detection of objects that are present in a scene. To develop robust representations for this challenging task, high-level visual features at multiple spatial scales must be extracted and augmented with contextual information. However, existing models aimed at explaining human fixation maps do not incorporate such a mechanism explicitly. Here we propose an approach based on a convolutional neural network pre-trained on a large-scale image classification task. The architecture forms an encoder-decoder structure and includes a module with multiple convolutional layers at different dilation rates to capture multi-scale features in parallel. Moreover, we combine the resulting representations with global scene information for accurately predicting visual saliency. Our model achieves competitive and consistent results across multiple evaluation metrics on two public saliency benchmarks and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach on five datasets and selected examples. Compared to state of the art approaches, the network is based on a lightweight image classification backbone and hence presents a suitable choice for applications with limited computational resources, such as (virtual) robotic systems, to estimate human fixations across complex natural scenes."
1902.09707,MFQE 2.0: A New Approach for Multi-frame Quality Enhancement on   Compressed Video,"The past few years have witnessed great success in applying deep learning to enhance the quality of compressed image/video. The existing approaches mainly focus on enhancing the quality of a single frame, not considering the similarity between consecutive frames. Since heavy fluctuation exists across compressed video frames as investigated in this paper, frame similarity can be utilized for quality enhancement of low-quality frames given their neighboring high-quality frames. This task is Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement (MFQE). Accordingly, this paper proposes an MFQE approach for compressed video, as the first attempt in this direction. In our approach, we firstly develop a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) based detector to locate Peak Quality Frames (PQFs) in compressed video. Then, a novel Multi-Frame Convolutional Neural Network (MF-CNN) is designed to enhance the quality of compressed video, in which the non-PQF and its nearest two PQFs are the input. In MF-CNN, motion between the non-PQF and PQFs is compensated by a motion compensation subnet. Subsequently, a quality enhancement subnet fuses the non-PQF and compensated PQFs, and then reduces the compression artifacts of the non-PQF. Also, PQF quality is enhanced in the same way. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our MFQE approach in advancing the state-of-the-art quality enhancement of compressed video. The code is available at https://github.com/RyanXingQL/MFQEv2.0.git."
1902.11122,Deep Learning in Cardiology,"The medical field is creating large amount of data that physicians are unable to decipher and use efficiently. Moreover, rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis, prediction and intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform the data non-linearly, thus, revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data, signal and imaging modalities from cardiology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of applying deep learning in cardiology that also apply in medicine in general, while proposing certain directions as the most viable for clinical use."
1903.00289,Provably scale-covariant networks from oriented quasi quadrature   measures in cascade,"This article presents a continuous model for hierarchical networks based on a combination of mathematically derived models of receptive fields and biologically inspired computations. Based on a functional model of complex cells in terms of an oriented quasi quadrature combination of first- and second-order directional Gaussian derivatives, we couple such primitive computations in cascade over combinatorial expansions over image orientations. Scale-space properties of the computational primitives are analysed and it is shown that the resulting representation allows for provable scale and rotation covariance. A prototype application to texture analysis is developed and it is demonstrated that a simplified mean-reduced representation of the resulting QuasiQuadNet leads to promising experimental results on three texture datasets."
1903.01192,STEFANN: Scene Text Editor using Font Adaptive Neural Network,"Textual information in a captured scene plays an important role in scene interpretation and decision making. Though there exist methods that can successfully detect and interpret complex text regions present in a scene, to the best of our knowledge, there is no significant prior work that aims to modify the textual information in an image. The ability to edit text directly on images has several advantages including error correction, text restoration and image reusability. In this paper, we propose a method to modify text in an image at character-level. We approach the problem in two stages. At first, the unobserved character (target) is generated from an observed character (source) being modified. We propose two different neural network architectures - (a) FANnet to achieve structural consistency with source font and (b) Colornet to preserve source color. Next, we replace the source character with the generated character maintaining both geometric and visual consistency with neighboring characters. Our method works as a unified platform for modifying text in images. We present the effectiveness of our method on COCO-Text and ICDAR datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively."
1903.06811,"Multi-camera calibration with pattern rigs, including for   non-overlapping cameras: CALICO","This paper describes CALICO, a method for multi-camera calibration suitable for challenging contexts: stationary and mobile multi-camera systems, cameras without overlapping fields of view, and non-synchronized cameras. Recent approaches are roughly divided into infrastructure- and pattern-based. Infrastructure-based approaches use the scene's features to calibrate, while pattern-based approaches use calibration patterns. Infrastructure-based approaches are not suitable for stationary camera systems, and pattern-based approaches may constrain camera placement because shared fields of view or extremely large patterns are required.   CALICO is a pattern-based approach, where the multi-calibration problem is formulated using rigidity constraints between patterns and cameras. We use a {\it pattern rig}: several patterns rigidly attached to each other or some structure. We express the calibration problem as that of algebraic and reprojection error minimization problems. Simulated and real experiments demonstrate the method in a variety of settings. CALICO compared favorably to Kalibr. Mean reconstruction accuracy error was $\le 0.71$ mm for real camera rigs, and $\le 1.11$ for simulated camera rigs. Code and data releases are available at \cite{tabb_amy_2019_3520866} and \url{https://github.com/amy-tabb/calico}."
1904.03391,KNN and ANN-based Recognition of Handwritten Pashto Letters using Zoning Features,"This paper presents a recognition system for handwritten Pashto letters. However, handwritten character recognition is a challenging task. These letters not only differ in shape and style but also vary among individuals. The recognition becomes further daunting due to the lack of standard datasets for inscribed Pashto letters. In this work, we have designed a database of moderate size, which encompasses a total of 4488 images, stemming from 102 distinguishing samples for each of the 44 letters in Pashto. The recognition framework uses zoning feature extractor followed by K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) classifiers for classifying individual letter. Based on the evaluation of the proposed system, an overall classification accuracy of approximately 70.05% is achieved by using KNN while 72% is achieved by using NN."
1904.04339,L2AE-D: Learning to Aggregate Embeddings for Few-shot Learning with   Meta-level Dropout,"Few-shot learning focuses on learning a new visual concept with very limited labelled examples. A successful approach to tackle this problem is to compare the similarity between examples in a learned metric space based on convolutional neural networks. However, existing methods typically suffer from meta-level overfitting due to the limited amount of training tasks and do not normally consider the importance of the convolutional features of different examples within the same channel. To address these limitations, we make the following two contributions: (a) We propose a novel meta-learning approach for aggregating useful convolutional features and suppressing noisy ones based on a channel-wise attention mechanism to improve class representations. The proposed model does not require fine-tuning and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The main novelty lies in incorporating a shared weight generation module that learns to assign different weights to the feature maps of different examples within the same channel. (b) We also introduce a simple meta-level dropout technique that reduces meta-level overfitting in several few-shot learning approaches. In our experiments, we find that this simple technique significantly improves the performance of the proposed method as well as various state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms. Applying our method to few-shot image recognition using Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets shows that it is capable of delivering a state-of-the-art classification performance."
1904.05449,Analyzing Dynamical Brain Functional Connectivity As Trajectories on   Space of Covariance Matrices,"Human brain functional connectivity (FC) is often measured as the similarity of functional MRI responses across brain regions when a brain is either resting or performing a task. This paper aims to statistically analyze the dynamic nature of FC by representing the collective time-series data, over a set of brain regions, as a trajectory on the space of covariance matrices, or symmetric-positive definite matrices (SPDMs). We use a recently developed metric on the space of SPDMs for quantifying differences across FC observations, and for clustering and classification of FC trajectories. To facilitate large scale and high-dimensional data analysis, we propose a novel, metric-based dimensionality reduction technique to reduce data from large SPDMs to small SPDMs. We illustrate this comprehensive framework using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database for multiple subjects and tasks, with task classification rates that match or outperform state-of-the-art techniques."
1904.05519,Efficient and Robust Registration on the 3D Special Euclidean Group,"We present an accurate, robust and fast method for registration of 3D scans. Our motion estimation optimizes a robust cost function on the intrinsic representation of rigid motions, i.e., the Special Euclidean group $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We exploit the geometric properties of Lie groups as well as the robustness afforded by an iteratively reweighted least squares optimization. We also generalize our approach to a joint multiview method that simultaneously solves for the registration of a set of scans. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by thorough experimental validation. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art robust 3D registration method based on a line process in terms of both speed and accuracy. We also show that this line process method is a special case of our principled geometric solution. Finally, we also present scenarios where global registration based on feature correspondences fails but multiview ICP based on our robust motion estimation is successful."
1904.09601,MiniMax Entropy Network: Learning Category-Invariant Features for Domain   Adaptation,"How to effectively learn from unlabeled data from the target domain is crucial for domain adaptation, as it helps reduce the large performance gap due to domain shift or distribution change. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-implement method dubbed MiniMax Entropy Networks (MMEN) based on adversarial learning. Unlike most existing approaches which employ a generator to deal with domain difference, MMEN focuses on learning the categorical information from unlabeled target samples with the help of labeled source samples. Specifically, we set an unfair multi-class classifier named categorical discriminator, which classifies source samples accurately but be confused about the categories of target samples. The generator learns a common subspace that aligns the unlabeled samples based on the target pseudo-labels. For MMEN, we also provide theoretical explanations to show that the learning of feature alignment reduces domain mismatch at the category level. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing state-of-the-art baselines."
1904.11592,Optical Flow Techniques for Facial Expression Analysis -- a Practical   Evaluation Study,"Optical flow techniques are becoming increasingly performant and robust when estimating motion in a scene, but their performance has yet to be proven in the area of facial expression recognition. In this work, a variety of optical flow approaches are evaluated across multiple facial expression datasets, so as to provide a consistent performance evaluation. The aim of this work is not to propose a new expression recognition technique, but to understand better the adequacy of existing state-of-the art optical flow for encoding facial motion in the context of facial expression recognition. Our evaluations highlight the fact that motion approximation methods used to overcome motion discontinuities have a significant impact when optical flows are used to characterize facial expressions."
1904.13216,Signal2Image Modules in Deep Neural Networks for EEG Classification,"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision utilizing the increased availability of big data and the power of parallel computational units such as graphical processing units. The vast majority of deep learning research is conducted using images as training data, however the biomedical domain is rich in physiological signals that are used for diagnosis and prediction problems. It is still an open research question how to best utilize signals to train deep neural networks.   In this paper we define the term Signal2Image (S2Is) as trainable or non-trainable prefix modules that convert signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG), to image-like representations making them suitable for training image-based deep neural networks defined as `base models'. We compare the accuracy and time performance of four S2Is (`signal as image', spectrogram, one and two layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)) combined with a set of `base models' (LeNet, AlexNet, VGGnet, ResNet, DenseNet) along with the depth-wise and 1D variations of the latter. We also provide empirical evidence that the one layer CNN S2I performs better in eleven out of fifteen tested models than non-trainable S2Is for classifying EEG signals and we present visual comparisons of the outputs of the S2Is."
1905.01058,Semantic Segmentation of Video Sequences with Convolutional LSTMs,"Most of the semantic segmentation approaches have been developed for single image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal, and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays, state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach for up to 1.6 percent."
1905.05487,American Sign Language Alphabet Recognition using Deep Learning,Tremendous headway has been made in the field of 3D hand pose estimation but the 3D depth cameras are usually inaccessible. We propose a model to recognize American Sign Language alphabet from RGB images. Images for the training were resized and pre-processed before training the Deep Neural Network. The model was trained on a squeezenet architecture to make it capable of running on mobile devices with an accuracy of 83.29%.
1905.08610,Skin Cancer Recognition using Deep Residual Network,"The advances in technology have enabled people to access internet from every part of the world. But to date, access to healthcare in remote areas is sparse. This proposed solution aims to bridge the gap between specialist doctors and patients. This prototype will be able to detect skin cancer from an image captured by the phone or any other camera. The network is deployed on cloud server-side processing for an even more accurate result. The Deep Residual learning model has been used for predicting the probability of cancer for server side The ResNet has three parametric layers. Each layer has Convolutional Neural Network, Batch Normalization, Maxpool and ReLU. Currently the model achieves an accuracy of 77% on the ISIC - 2017 challenge."
1905.10529,Domain Adaptive Attention Learning for Unsupervised Person   Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (Re-ID) across multiple datasets is a challenging task due to two main reasons: the presence of large cross-dataset distinctions and the absence of annotated target instances. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a domain adaptive attention learning approach to reliably transfer discriminative representation from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. In this approach, a domain adaptive attention model is learned to separate the feature map into domain-shared part and domain-specific part. In this manner, the domain-shared part is used to capture transferable cues that can compensate cross-dataset distinctions and give positive contributions to the target task, while the domain-specific part aims to model the noisy information to avoid the negative transfer caused by domain diversity. A soft label loss is further employed to take full use of unlabeled target data by estimating pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts."
1905.10711,DISN: Deep Implicit Surface Network for High-quality Single-view 3D   Reconstruction,"Reconstructing 3D shapes from single-view images has been a long-standing research problem. In this paper, we present DISN, a Deep Implicit Surface Network which can generate a high-quality detail-rich 3D mesh from an 2D image by predicting the underlying signed distance fields. In addition to utilizing global image features, DISN predicts the projected location for each 3D point on the 2D image, and extracts local features from the image feature maps. Combining global and local features significantly improves the accuracy of the signed distance field prediction, especially for the detail-rich areas. To the best of our knowledge, DISN is the first method that constantly captures details such as holes and thin structures present in 3D shapes from single-view images. DISN achieves the state-of-the-art single-view reconstruction performance on a variety of shape categories reconstructed from both synthetic and real images.

1905.13555,Provably scale-covariant continuous hierarchical networks based on   scale-normalized differential expressions coupled in cascade,"This article presents a theory for constructing hierarchical networks in such a way that the networks are guaranteed to be provably scale covariant. We first present a general sufficiency argument for obtaining scale covariance, which holds for a wide class of networks defined from linear and non-linear differential expressions expressed in terms of scale-normalized scale-space derivatives. Then, we present a more detailed development of one example of such a network constructed from a combination of mathematically derived models of receptive fields and biologically inspired computations. Based on a functional model of complex cells in terms of an oriented quasi quadrature combination of first- and second-order directional Gaussian derivatives, we couple such primitive computations in cascade over combinatorial expansions over image orientations. Scale-space properties of the computational primitives are analysed and we give explicit proofs of how the resulting representation allows for scale and rotation covariance. A prototype application to texture analysis is developed and it is demonstrated that a simplified mean-reduced representation of the resulting QuasiQuadNet leads to promising experimental results on three texture datasets."
1906.01304,Vision-Based Autonomous UAV Navigation and Landing for Urban Search and   Rescue,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with bioradars are a life-saving technology that can enable identification of survivors under collapsed buildings in the aftermath of natural disasters such as earthquakes or gas explosions. However, these UAVs have to be able to autonomously navigate in disaster struck environments and land on debris piles in order to accurately locate the survivors. This problem is extremely challenging as pre-existing maps cannot be leveraged for navigation due to structural changes that may have occurred. Furthermore, existing landing site detection algorithms are not suitable to identify safe landing regions on debris piles. In this work, we present a computationally efficient system for autonomous UAV navigation and landing that does not require any prior knowledge about the environment. We propose a novel landing site detection algorithm that computes costmaps based on several hazard factors including terrain flatness, steepness, depth accuracy, and energy consumption information. We also introduce a first-of-a-kind synthetic dataset of over 1.2 million images of collapsed buildings with groundtruth depth, surface normals, semantics and camera pose information. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system using experiments from a city scale hyperrealistic simulation environment and in real-world scenarios with collapsed buildings."
1906.02429,Occluded Face Recognition Using Low-rank Regression with Generalized   Gradient Direction,"In this paper, a very effective method to solve the contiguous face occlusion recognition problem is proposed. It utilizes the robust image gradient direction features together with a variety of mapping functions and adopts a hierarchical sparse and low-rank regression model. This model unites the sparse representation in dictionary learning and the low-rank representation on the error term that is usually messy in the gradient domain. We call it the ""weak low-rankness"" optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by the framework of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The optimum of the error term has a similar weak low-rank structure as the reference error map and the recognition performance can be enhanced by leaps and bounds using weak low-rankness optimization. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world disguise / occlusion data and synthesized contiguous occlusion data. These experiments show that the proposed gradient direction-based hierarchical adaptive sparse and low-rank (GD-HASLR) algorithm has the best performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including popular convolutional neural network-based methods."
1906.02939,Key Ingredients of Self-Driving Cars,"Over the past decade, many research articles have been published in the area of autonomous driving. However, most of them focus only on a specific technological area, such as visual environment perception, vehicle control, etc. Furthermore, due to fast advances in the self-driving car technology, such articles become obsolete very fast. In this paper, we give a brief but comprehensive overview on key ingredients of autonomous cars (ACs), including driving automation levels, AC sensors, AC software, open source datasets, industry leaders, AC applications and existing challenges."
1906.04002,Detecting Clues for Skill Levels and Machine Operation Difficulty from   Egocentric Vision,"With respect to machine operation tasks, the experiences from different skill level operators, especially novices, can provide worthy understanding about the manner in which they perceive the operational environment and formulate knowledge to deal with various operation situations. In this study, we describe the operator's behaviors by utilizing the relations among their head, hand, and operation location (hotspot) during the operation. A total of 40 experiences associated with a sewing machine operation task performed by amateur operators was recorded via a head-mounted RGB-D camera. We examined important features of operational behaviors in different skill level operators and confirmed their correlation to the difficulties of the operation steps. The result shows that the pure-gazing behavior is significantly reduced when the operator's skill improved. Moreover, the hand-approaching duration and the frequency of attention movement before operation are strongly correlated to the operational difficulty in such machine operating environments."
1906.06439,Image Counterfactual Sensitivity Analysis for Detecting Unintended Bias,"Facial analysis models are increasingly used in applications that have serious impacts on people's lives, ranging from authentication to surveillance tracking. It is therefore critical to develop techniques that can reveal unintended biases in facial classifiers to help guide the ethical use of facial analysis technology. This work proposes a framework called \textit{image counterfactual sensitivity analysis}, which we explore as a proof-of-concept in analyzing a smiling attribute classifier trained on faces of celebrities. The framework utilizes counterfactuals to examine how a classifier's prediction changes if a face characteristic slightly changes. We leverage recent advances in generative adversarial networks to build a realistic generative model of face images that affords controlled manipulation of specific image characteristics. We then introduce a set of metrics that measure the effect of manipulating a specific property on the output of the trained classifier. Empirically, we find several different factors of variation that affect the predictions of the smiling classifier. This proof-of-concept demonstrates potential ways generative models can be leveraged for fine-grained analysis of bias and fairness."
1906.09744,Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Stochastic Neighbour   Embedding with Isolation Kernel,"This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of Gaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects. First, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of misrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian kernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each local bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is derived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of Isolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because data-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned. In contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the computational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly improves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating misrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE from processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy, unlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE."
1906.11577,A PolSAR Scattering Power Factorization Framework and Novel Roll-Invariant Parameters Based Unsupervised Classification Scheme Using a Geodesic Distance,"We propose a generic Scattering Power Factorization Framework (SPFF) for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to directly obtain $N$ scattering power components along with a residue power component for each pixel. Each scattering power component is factorized into similarity (or dissimilarity) using elementary targets and a generalized random volume model. The similarity measure is derived using a geodesic distance between pairs of $4\times4$ real Kennaugh matrices. In standard model-based decomposition schemes, the $3\times3$ Hermitian positive semi-definite covariance (or coherency) matrix is expressed as a weighted linear combination of scattering targets following a fixed hierarchical process. In contrast, under the proposed framework, a convex splitting of unity is performed to obtain the weights while preserving the dominance of the scattering components. The product of the total power (Span) with these weights provides the non-negative scattering power components. Furthermore, the framework along the geodesic distance is effectively used to obtain specific roll-invariant parameters which are then utilized to design an unsupervised classification scheme. The SPFF, the roll invariant parameters, and the classification results are assessed using C-band RADARSAT-2 and L-band ALOS-2 images of San Francisco."
1906.11875,Instant automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the OphtAI system for the automatic detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the automatic assessment of DR severity using color fundus photography. OphtAI relies on ensembles of convolutional neural networks trained to recognize eye laterality, detect referable DR and assess DR severity. The system can either process single images or full examination records. To document the automatic diagnoses, accurate heatmaps are generated. The system was developed and validated using a dataset of 763,848 images from 164,660 screening procedures from the OPHDIAT screening program. For comparison purposes, it was also evaluated in the public Messidor-2 dataset. Referable DR can be detected with an area under the ROC curve of AUC = 0.989 in the Messidor-2 dataset, using the University of Iowa's reference standard (95% CI: 0.984-0.994). This is better than the only AI system authorized by the FDA, evaluated in the exact same conditions (AUC = 0.980). OphtAI can also detect vision-threatening DR with an AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.996-0.998) and proliferative DR with an AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995-0.999). The system runs in 0.3 seconds using a graphics processing unit and less than 2 seconds without. OphtAI is safer, faster and more comprehensive than the only AI system authorized by the FDA so far. Instant DR diagnosis is now possible, which is expected to streamline DR screening and to give easy access to DR screening to more diabetic patients."
1907.01131,Learnable Gated Temporal Shift Module for Deep Video Inpainting,"How to efficiently utilize temporal information to recover videos in a consistent way is the main issue for video inpainting problems. Conventional 2D CNNs have achieved good performance on image inpainting but often lead to temporally inconsistent results where frames will flicker when applied to videos (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Vh1HDBjD0&list=PLPoVtv-xp_dL5uckIzz1PKwNjg1yI0I94&index=1); 3D CNNs can capture temporal information but are computationally intensive and hard to train. In this paper, we present a novel component termed Learnable Gated Temporal Shift Module (LGTSM) for video inpainting models that could effectively tackle arbitrary video masks without additional parameters from 3D convolutions. LGTSM is designed to let 2D convolutions make use of neighboring frames more efficiently, which is crucial for video inpainting. Specifically, in each layer, LGTSM learns to shift some channels to its temporal neighbors so that 2D convolutions could be enhanced to handle temporal information. Meanwhile, a gated convolution is applied to the layer to identify the masked areas that are poisoning for conventional convolutions. On the FaceForensics and Free-form Video Inpainting (FVI) dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results with simply 33% of parameters and inference time."
1907.01743,Deep Attentive Features for Prostate Segmentation in 3D Transrectal   Ultrasound,"Automatic prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images is of essential importance for image-guided prostate interventions and treatment planning. However, developing such automatic solutions remains very challenging due to the missing/ambiguous boundary and inhomogeneous intensity distribution of the prostate in TRUS, as well as the large variability in prostate shapes. This paper develops a novel 3D deep neural network equipped with attention modules for better prostate segmentation in TRUS by fully exploiting the complementary information encoded in different layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention module utilizes the attention mechanism to selectively leverage the multilevel features integrated from different layers to refine the features at each individual layer, suppressing the non-prostate noise at shallow layers of the CNN and increasing more prostate details into features at deep layers. Experimental results on challenging 3D TRUS volumes show that our method attains satisfactory segmentation performance. The proposed attention mechanism is a general strategy to aggregate multi-level deep features and has the potential to be used for other medical image segmentation tasks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wulalago/DAF3D."
1907.03802,Personalised aesthetics with residual adapters,"The use of computational methods to evaluate aesthetics in photography has gained interest in recent years due to the popularization of convolutional neural networks and the availability of new annotated datasets. Most studies in this area have focused on designing models that do not take into account individual preferences for the prediction of the aesthetic value of pictures. We propose a model based on residual learning that is capable of learning subjective, user specific preferences over aesthetics in photography, while surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and keeping a limited number of user-specific parameters in the model. Our model can also be used for picture enhancement, and it is suitable for content-based or hybrid recommender systems in which the amount of computational resources is limited."
1907.03865,Brain Tissues Segmentation on MR Perfusion Images Using CUSUM Filter for   Boundary Pixels,"The fully automated and relatively accurate method of brain tissues segmentation on T2-weighted magnetic resonance perfusion images is proposed. Segmentation with this method provides a possibility to obtain perfusion region of interest on images with abnormal brain anatomy that is very important for perfusion analysis. In the proposed method the result is presented as a binary mask, which marks two regions: brain tissues pixels with unity values and skull, extracranial soft tissue and background pixels with zero values. The binary mask is produced based on the location of boundary between two studied regions. Each boundary point is detected with CUSUM filter as a change point for iteratively accumulated points at time of moving on a sinusoidal-like path along the boundary from one region to another. The evaluation results for 20 clinical cases showed that proposed segmentation method could significantly reduce the time and efforts required to obtain desirable results for perfusion region of interest detection on T2-weighted magnetic resonance perfusion images with abnormal brain anatomy."
1907.05062,FIRE: Unsupervised bi-directional inter-modality registration using deep   networks,"Inter-modality image registration is an critical preprocessing step for many applications within the routine clinical pathway. This paper presents an unsupervised deep inter-modality registration network that can learn the optimal affine and non-rigid transformations simultaneously. Inverse-consistency is an important property commonly ignored in recent deep learning based inter-modality registration algorithms. We address this issue through the proposed multi-task architecture and the new comprehensive transformation network. Specifically, the proposed model learns a modality-independent latent representation to perform cycle-consistent cross-modality synthesis, and use an inverse-consistent loss to learn a pair of transformations to align the synthesized image with the target. We name this proposed framework as FIRE due to the shape of its structure. Our method shows comparable and better performances with the popular baseline method in experiments on multi-sequence brain MR data and intra-modality 4D cardiac Cine-MR data."
1907.06592,Sparsely Activated Networks,"Previous literature on unsupervised learning focused on designing structural priors with the aim of learning meaningful features. However, this was done without considering the description length of the learned representations which is a direct and unbiased measure of the model complexity. In this paper, first we introduce the $\varphi$ metric that evaluates unsupervised models based on their reconstruction accuracy and the degree of compression of their internal representations. We then present and define two activation functions (Identity, ReLU) as base of reference and three sparse activation functions (top-k absolutes, Extrema-Pool indices, Extrema) as candidate structures that minimize the previously defined $\varphi$. We lastly present Sparsely Activated Networks (SANs) that consist of kernels with shared weights that, during encoding, are convolved with the input and then passed through a sparse activation function. During decoding, the same weights are convolved with the sparse activation map and subsequently the partial reconstructions from each weight are summed to reconstruct the input. We compare SANs using the five previously defined activation functions on a variety of datasets (Physionet, UCI-epilepsy, MNIST, FMNIST) and show that models that are selected using $\varphi$ have small description representation length and consist of interpretable kernels."
1907.06781,"Rethinking RGB-D Salient Object Detection: Models, Data Sets, and   Large-Scale Benchmarks","The use of RGB-D information for salient object detection has been extensively explored in recent years. However, relatively few efforts have been put towards modeling salient object detection in real-world human activity scenes with RGBD. In this work, we fill the gap by making the following contributions to RGB-D salient object detection. (1) We carefully collect a new SIP (salient person) dataset, which consists of ~1K high-resolution images that cover diverse real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusions, illuminations, and backgrounds. (2) We conduct a large-scale (and, so far, the most comprehensive) benchmark comparing contemporary methods, which has long been missing in the field and can serve as a baseline for future research. We systematically summarize 32 popular models and evaluate 18 parts of 32 models on seven datasets containing a total of about 97K images. (3) We propose a simple general architecture, called Deep Depth-Depurator Network (D3Net). It consists of a depth depurator unit (DDU) and a three-stream feature learning module (FLM), which performs low-quality depth map filtering and cross-modal feature learning respectively. These components form a nested structure and are elaborately designed to be learned jointly. D3Net exceeds the performance of any prior contenders across all five metrics under consideration, thus serving as a strong model to advance research in this field. We also demonstrate that D3Net can be used to efficiently extract salient object masks from real scenes, enabling effective background changing application with a speed of 65fps on a single GPU. All the saliency maps, our new SIP dataset, the D3Net model, and the evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/DengPingFan/D3NetBenchmark."
1907.09423,Satellite-Net: Automatic Extraction of Land Cover Indicators from   Satellite Imagery by Deep Learning,"In this paper we address the challenge of land cover classification for satellite images via Deep Learning (DL). Land Cover aims to detect the physical characteristics of the territory and estimate the percentage of land occupied by a certain category of entities: vegetation, residential buildings, industrial areas, forest areas, rivers, lakes, etc. DL is a new paradigm for Big Data analytics and in particular for Computer Vision. The application of DL in images classification for land cover purposes has a great potential owing to the high degree of automation and computing performance. In particular, the invention of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) was a fundament for the advancements in this field. In [1], the Satellite Task Team of the UN Global Working Group describes the results achieved so far with respect to the use of earth observation for Official Statistics. However, in that study, CNNs have not yet been explored for automatic classification of imagery. This work investigates the usage of CNNs for the estimation of land cover indicators, providing evidence of the first promising results. In particular, the paper proposes a customized model, called Satellite-Net, able to reach an accuracy level up to 98% on test sets."
1907.10831,Safe Feature Elimination for Non-Negativity Constrained Convex   Optimization,"Inspired by recent work on safe feature elimination for $1$-norm regularized least-squares, we develop strategies to eliminate features from convex optimization problems with non-negativity constraints. Our strategy is safe in the sense that it will only remove features/coordinates from the problem when they are guaranteed to be zero at a solution. To perform feature elimination we use an accurate, but not optimal, primal-dual feasible pair, making our methods robust and able to be used on ill-conditioned problems. We supplement our feature elimination problem with a method to construct an accurate dual feasible point from an accurate primal feasible point; this allows us to use a first-order method to find an accurate primal feasible point, then use that point to construct an accurate dual feasible point and perform feature elimination. Under reasonable conditions, our feature elimination strategy will eventually eliminate all zero features from the problem. As an application of our methods we show how safe feature elimination can be used to robustly certify the uniqueness of non-negative least-squares (NNLS) problems. We give numerical examples on a well-conditioned synthetic NNLS problem and a on set of 40000 extremely ill-conditioned NNLS problems arising in a microscopy application."
1907.13426,Expectation-Maximization Attention Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Self-attention mechanism has been widely used for various tasks. It is designed to compute the representation of each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Thus, it can capture long-range relations for computer vision tasks. However, it is computationally consuming. Since the attention maps are computed w.r.t all other positions. In this paper, we formulate the attention mechanism into an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimate a much more compact set of bases upon which the attention maps are computed. By a weighted summation upon these bases, the resulting representation is low-rank and deprecates noisy information from the input. The proposed Expectation-Maximization Attention (EMA) module is robust to the variance of input and is also friendly in memory and computation. Moreover, we set up the bases maintenance and normalization methods to stabilize its training procedure. We conduct extensive experiments on popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff, on which we set new records."
1908.01978,Multi-view Deep Subspace Clustering Networks,"Multi-view subspace clustering aims to discover the inherent structure of data by fusing multiple views of complementary information. Most existing methods first extract multiple types of handcrafted features and then learn a joint affinity matrix for clustering. The disadvantage of this approach lies in two aspects: 1) multi-view relations are not embedded into feature learning, and 2) the end-to-end learning manner of deep learning is not suitable for multi-view clustering. Even when deep features have been extracted, it is a nontrivial problem to choose a proper backbone for clustering on different datasets. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-view Deep Subspace Clustering Networks (MvDSCN), which learns a multi-view self-representation matrix in an end-to-end manner. The MvDSCN consists of two sub-networks, \ie, a diversity network (Dnet) and a universality network (Unet). A latent space is built using deep convolutional autoencoders, and a self-representation matrix is learned in the latent space using a fully connected layer. Dnet learns view-specific self-representation matrices, whereas Unet learns a common self-representation matrix for all views. To exploit the complementarity of multi-view representations, the Hilbert--Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced as a diversity regularizer that captures the nonlinear, high-order inter-view relations. Because different views share the same label space, the self-representation matrices of each view are aligned to the common one by universality regularization. The MvDSCN also unifies multiple backbones to boost clustering performance and avoid the need for model selection. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the MvDSCN."
1908.04126,Improving Robustness of Deep Learning Based Knee MRI Segmentation: Mixup   and Adversarial Domain Adaptation,"Degeneration of articular cartilage (AC) is actively studied in knee osteoarthritis (OA) research via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Segmentation of AC tissues from MRI data is an essential step in quantification of their damage. Deep learning (DL) based methods have shown potential in this realm and are the current state-of-the-art, however, their robustness to heterogeneity of MRI acquisition settings remains an open problem. In this study, we investigated two modern regularization techniques -- mixup and adversarial unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) -- to improve the robustness of DL-based knee cartilage segmentation to new MRI acquisition settings. Our validation setup included two datasets produced by different MRI scanners and using distinct data acquisition protocols. We assessed the robustness of automatic segmentation by comparing mixup and UDA approaches to a strong baseline method at different OA severity stages and, additionally, in relation to anatomical locations. Our results showed that for moderate changes in knee MRI data acquisition settings both approaches may provide notable improvements in the robustness, which are consistent for all stages of the disease and affect the clinically important areas of the knee joint. However, mixup may be considered as a recommended approach, since it is more computationally efficient and does not require additional data from the target acquisition setup."
1908.05040,Deep Generalized Max Pooling,"Global pooling layers are an essential part of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). They are used to aggregate activations of spatial locations to produce a fixed-size vector in several state-of-the-art CNNs. Global average pooling or global max pooling are commonly used for converting convolutional features of variable size images to a fix-sized embedding. However, both pooling layer types are computed spatially independent: each individual activation map is pooled and thus activations of different locations are pooled together. In contrast, we propose Deep Generalized Max Pooling that balances the contribution of all activations of a spatially coherent region by re-weighting all descriptors so that the impact of frequent and rare ones is equalized. We show that this layer is superior to both average and max pooling on the classification of Latin medieval manuscripts (CLAMM'16, CLAMM'17), as well as writer identification (Historical-WI'17)."
1908.05782,"MimickNet, Matching Clinical Post-Processing Under Realistic Black-Box   Constraints","Image post-processing is used in clinical-grade ultrasound scanners to improve image quality (e.g., reduce speckle noise and enhance contrast). These post-processing techniques vary across manufacturers and are generally kept proprietary, which presents a challenge for researchers looking to match current clinical-grade workflows. We introduce a deep learning framework, MimickNet, that transforms raw conventional delay-and-summed (DAS) beams into the approximate post-processed images found on clinical-grade scanners. Training MimickNet only requires post-processed image samples from a scanner of interest without the need for explicit pairing to raw DAS data. This flexibility allows it to hypothetically approximate any manufacturer's post-processing without access to the pre-processed data. MimickNet generates images with an average similarity index measurement (SSIM) of 0.930$\pm$0.0892 on a 300 cineloop test set, and it generalizes to cardiac cineloops outside of our train-test distribution achieving an SSIM of 0.967$\pm$0.002. We also explore the theoretical SSIM achievable by evaluating MimickNet performance when trained under gray-box constraints (i.e., when both pre-processed and post-processed images are available). To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish deep learning models that closely approximate current clinical-grade ultrasound post-processing under realistic black-box constraints where before and after post-processing data is unavailable. MimickNet serves as a clinical post-processing baseline for future works in ultrasound image formation to compare against. To this end, we have made the MimickNet software open source."
1908.08652,MTCNET: Multi-task Learning Paradigm for Crowd Count Estimation,"We propose a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) paradigm based deep neural network architecture, called MTCNet (Multi-Task Crowd Network) for crowd density and count estimation. Crowd count estimation is challenging due to the non-uniform scale variations and the arbitrary perspective of an individual image. The proposed model has two related tasks, with Crowd Density Estimation as the main task and Crowd-Count Group Classification as the auxiliary task. The auxiliary task helps in capturing the relevant scale-related information to improve the performance of the main task. The main task model comprises two blocks: VGG-16 front-end for feature extraction and a dilated Convolutional Neural Network for density map generation. The auxiliary task model shares the same front-end as the main task, followed by a CNN classifier. Our proposed network achieves 5.8% and 14.9% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) than the state-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech dataset without using any data augmentation. Our model also outperforms with 10.5% lower MAE on UCF_CC_50 dataset."
1908.10406,An Effective and Efficient Method for Detecting Hands in Egocentric   Videos for Rehabilitation Applications,"Objective: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) report upper limb function as their top recovery priority. To accurately represent the true impact of new interventions on patient function and independence, evaluation should occur in a natural setting. Wearable cameras can be used to monitor hand function at home, using computer vision to automatically analyze the resulting videos (egocentric video). A key step in this process, hand detection, is difficult to do robustly and reliably, hindering deployment of a complete monitoring system in the home and community. We propose an accurate and efficient hand detection method that uses a simple combination of existing detection and tracking algorithms. Methods: Detection, tracking, and combination methods were evaluated on a new hand detection dataset, consisting of 167,622 frames of egocentric videos collected on 17 individuals with SCI performing activities of daily living in a home simulation laboratory. Results: The F1-scores for the best detector and tracker alone (SSD and Median Flow) were 0.90$\pm$0.07 and 0.42$\pm$0.18, respectively. The best combination method, in which a detector was used to initialize and reset a tracker, resulted in an F1-score of 0.87$\pm$0.07 while being two times faster than the fastest detector alone. Conclusion: The combination of the fastest detector and best tracker improved the accuracy over online trackers while improving the speed of detectors. Significance: The method proposed here, in combination with wearable cameras, will help clinicians directly measure hand function in a patient's daily life at home, enabling independence after SCI."
1909.01940,Can we trust deep learning models diagnosis? The impact of domain shift   in chest radiograph classification,"While deep learning models become more widespread, their ability to handle unseen data and generalize for any scenario is yet to be challenged. In medical imaging, there is a high heterogeneity of distributions among images based on the equipment that generates them and their parametrization. This heterogeneity triggers a common issue in machine learning called domain shift, which represents the difference between the training data distribution and the distribution of where a model is employed. A high domain shift tends to implicate in a poor generalization performance from the models. In this work, we evaluate the extent of domain shift on four of the largest datasets of chest radiographs. We show how training and testing with different datasets (e.g., training in ChestX-ray14 and testing in CheXpert) drastically affects model performance, posing a big question over the reliability of deep learning models trained on public datasets. We also show that models trained on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR generalize better to other datasets."
1910.04331,Agent with Warm Start and Active Termination for Plane Localization in   3D Ultrasound,"Standard plane localization is crucial for ultrasound (US) diagnosis. In prenatal US, dozens of standard planes are manually acquired with a 2D probe. It is time-consuming and operator-dependent. In comparison, 3D US containing multiple standard planes in one shot has the inherent advantages of less user-dependency and more efficiency. However, manual plane localization in US volume is challenging due to the huge search space and large fetal posture variation. In this study, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework to automatically localize fetal brain standard planes in 3D US. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we equip the RL framework with a landmark-aware alignment module to provide warm start and strong spatial bounds for the agent actions, thus ensuring its effectiveness. Second, instead of passively and empirically terminating the agent inference, we propose a recurrent neural network based strategy for active termination of the agent's interaction procedure. This improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the localization system. Extensively validated on our in-house large dataset, our approach achieves the accuracy of 3.4mm/9.6{\deg} and 2.7mm/9.1{\deg} for the transcerebellar and transthalamic plane localization, respectively. Ourproposed RL framework is general and has the potential to improve the efficiency and standardization of US scanning."
1910.04935,FetusMap: Fetal Pose Estimation in 3D Ultrasound,"The 3D ultrasound (US) entrance inspires a multitude of automated prenatal examinations. However, studies about the structuralized description of the whole fetus in 3D US are still rare. In this paper, we propose to estimate the 3D pose of fetus in US volumes to facilitate its quantitative analyses in global and local scales. Given the great challenges in 3D US, including the high volume dimension, poor image quality, symmetric ambiguity in anatomical structures and large variations of fetal pose, our contribution is three-fold. (i) This is the first work about 3D pose estimation of fetus in the literature. We aim to extract the skeleton of whole fetus and assign different segments/joints with correct torso/limb labels. (ii) We propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to finetune the deep network to form visually plausible pose predictions. Specifically, we leverage the landmark-based registration to effectively encode case-adaptive anatomical priors and generate evolving label proxy for supervision. (iii) To enable our 3D network perceive better contextual cues with higher resolution input under limited computing resource, we further adopt the gradient check-pointing (GCP) strategy to save GPU memory and improve the prediction. Extensively validated on a large 3D US dataset, our method tackles varying fetal poses and achieves promising results. 3D pose estimation of fetus has potentials in serving as a map to provide navigation for many advanced studies."
1910.05602,Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Facial expression recognition is a topic of great interest in most fields from artificial intelligence and gaming to marketing and healthcare. The goal of this paper is to classify images of human faces into one of seven basic emotions. A number of different models were experimented with, including decision trees and neural networks before arriving at a final Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs work better for image recognition tasks since they are able to capture spacial features of the inputs due to their large number of filters. The proposed model consists of six convolutional layers, two max pooling layers and two fully connected layers. Upon tuning of the various hyperparameters, this model achieved a final accuracy of 0.60."
1910.07655,Deep Semantic Segmentation of Natural and Medical Images: A Review,"The semantic image segmentation task consists of classifying each pixel of an image into an instance, where each instance corresponds to a class. This task is a part of the concept of scene understanding or better explaining the global context of an image. In the medical image analysis domain, image segmentation can be used for image-guided interventions, radiotherapy, or improved radiological diagnostics. In this review, we categorize the leading deep learning-based medical and non-medical image segmentation solutions into six main groups of deep architectural, data synthesis-based, loss function-based, sequenced models, weakly supervised, and multi-task methods and provide a comprehensive review of the contributions in each of these groups. Further, for each group, we analyze each variant of these groups and discuss the limitations of the current approaches and present potential future research directions for semantic image segmentation."
1910.08173,Deep Weakly-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Pain Localization in Videos,"Automatic pain assessment has an important potential diagnostic value for populations that are incapable of articulating their pain experiences. As one of the dominating nonverbal channels for eliciting pain expression events, facial expressions has been widely investigated for estimating the pain intensity of individual. However, using state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in real-world pain estimation applications poses several challenges related to the subjective variations of facial expressions, operational capture conditions, and lack of representative training videos with labels. Given the cost of annotating intensity levels for every video frame, we propose a weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WSDA) technique that allows for training 3D CNNs for spatio-temporal pain intensity estimation using weakly labeled videos, where labels are provided on a periodic basis. In particular, WSDA integrates multiple instance learning into an adversarial deep domain adaptation framework to train an Inflated 3D-CNN (I3D) model such that it can accurately estimate pain intensities in the target operational domain. The training process relies on weak target loss, along with domain loss and source loss for domain adaptation of the I3D model. Experimental results obtained using labeled source domain RECOLA videos and weakly-labeled target domain UNBC-McMaster videos indicate that the proposed deep WSDA approach can achieve significantly higher level of sequence (bag)-level and frame (instance)-level pain localization accuracy than related state-of-the-art approaches."
1910.08853,Image Restoration Using Deep Regulated Convolutional Networks,"While the depth of convolutional neural networks has attracted substantial attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability. The code is available at https://github.com/cswin/RC-Nets."
1910.09455,Depth-wise Decomposition for Accelerating Separable Convolutions in   Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks,"Very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been firmly established as the primary methods for many computer vision tasks. However, most state-of-the-art CNNs are large, which results in high inference latency. Recently, depth-wise separable convolution has been proposed for image recognition tasks on computationally limited platforms such as robotics and self-driving cars. Though it is much faster than its counterpart, regular convolution, accuracy is sacrificed. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition approach based on SVD, namely depth-wise decomposition, for expanding regular convolutions into depthwise separable convolutions while maintaining high accuracy. We show our approach can be further generalized to the multi-channel and multi-layer cases, based on Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) [59]. We conduct thorough experiments with the latest ShuffleNet V2 model [47] on both random synthesized dataset and a large-scale image recognition dataset: ImageNet [10]. Our approach outperforms channel decomposition [73] on all datasets. More importantly, our approach improves the Top-1 accuracy of ShuffleNet V2 by ~2%."
1910.10330,Stain Style Transfer using Transitive Adversarial Networks,"Digitized pathological diagnosis has been in increasing demand recently. It is well known that color information is critical to the automatic and visual analysis of pathological slides. However, the color variations due to various factors not only have negative impact on pathologist's diagnosis, but also will reduce the robustness of the algorithms. The factors that cause the color differences are not only in the process of making the slices, but also in the process of digitization. Different strategies have been proposed to alleviate the color variations. Most of such techniques rely on collecting color statistics to perform color matching across images and highly dependent on a reference template slide. Since the pathological slides between hospitals are usually unpaired, these methods do not yield good matching results. In this work, we propose a novel network that we refer to as Transitive Adversarial Networks (TAN) to transfer the color information among slides from different hospitals or centers. It is not necessary for an expert to pick a representative reference slide in the proposed TAN method. We compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method yields an improvement of 0.87dB in terms of PSNR, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed TAN method in stain style transfer."
1910.12906,STEP: Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Emotion   Perception from Gaits,"We present a novel classifier network called STEP, to classify perceived human emotion from gaits, based on a Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture. Given an RGB video of an individual walking, our formulation implicitly exploits the gait features to classify the emotional state of the human into one of four emotions: happy, sad, angry, or neutral. We use hundreds of annotated real-world gait videos and augment them with thousands of annotated synthetic gaits generated using a novel generative network called STEP-Gen, built on an ST-GCN based Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). We incorporate a novel push-pull regularization loss in the CVAE formulation of STEP-Gen to generate realistic gaits and improve the classification accuracy of STEP. We also release a novel dataset (E-Gait), which consists of $2,177$ human gaits annotated with perceived emotions along with thousands of synthetic gaits. In practice, STEP can learn the affective features and exhibits classification accuracy of 89% on E-Gait, which is 14 - 30% more accurate over prior methods."
1910.13988,Auto-Annotation Quality Prediction for Semi-Supervised Learning with   Ensembles,"Auto-annotation by ensemble of models is an efficient method of learning on unlabeled data. Wrong or inaccurate annotations generated by the ensemble may lead to performance degradation of the trained model. To deal with this problem we propose filtering the auto-labeled data using a trained model that predicts the quality of the annotation from the degree of consensus between ensemble models. Using semantic segmentation as an example, we show the advantage of the proposed auto-annotation filtering over training on data contaminated with inaccurate labels.   Moreover, our experimental results show that in the case of semantic segmentation, the performance of a state-of-the-art model can be achieved by training it with only a fraction (30$\%$) of the original manually labeled data set, and replacing the rest with the auto-annotated, quality filtered labels."
1911.04169,Explaining Away Results in Accurate and Tolerant Template Matching,"Recognising and locating image patches or sets of image features is an important task underlying much work in computer vision. Traditionally this has been accomplished using template matching. However, template matching is notoriously brittle in the face of changes in appearance caused by, for example, variations in viewpoint, partial occlusion, and non-rigid deformations. This article tests a method of template matching that is more tolerant to such changes in appearance and that can, therefore, more accurately identify image patches. In traditional template matching the comparison between a template and the image is independent of the other templates. In contrast, the method advocated here takes into account the evidence provided by the image for the template at each location and the full range of alternative explanations represented by the same template at other locations and by other templates. Specifically, the proposed method of template matching is performed using a form of probabilistic inference known as ""explaining away"". The algorithm used to implement explaining away has previously been used to simulate several neurobiological mechanisms, and been applied to image contour detection and pattern recognition tasks. Here it is applied for the first time to image patch matching, and is shown to produce superior results in comparison to the current state-of-the-art methods."
1911.06998,Revisiting Shadow Detection: A New Benchmark Dataset for Complex World,"Shadow detection in general photos is a nontrivial problem, due to the complexity of the real world. Though recent shadow detectors have already achieved remarkable performance on various benchmark data, their performance is still limited for general real-world situations. In this work, we collected shadow images for multiple scenarios and compiled a new dataset of 10,500 shadow images, each with labeled ground-truth mask, for supporting shadow detection in the complex world. Our dataset covers a rich variety of scene categories, with diverse shadow sizes, locations, contrasts, and types. Further, we comprehensively analyze the complexity of the dataset, present a fast shadow detection network with a detail enhancement module to harvest shadow details, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to detect shadows in general situations."
1911.07308,Counterfactual Vision-and-Language Navigation via Adversarial Path   Sampling,"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a task where agents must decide how to move through a 3D environment to reach a goal by grounding natural language instructions to the visual surroundings. One of the problems of the VLN task is data scarcity since it is difficult to collect enough navigation paths with human-annotated instructions for interactive environments. In this paper, we explore the use of counterfactual thinking as a human-inspired data augmentation method that results in robust models. Counterfactual thinking is a concept that describes the human propensity to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred. We propose an adversarial-driven counterfactual reasoning model that can consider effective conditions instead of low-quality augmented data. In particular, we present a model-agnostic adversarial path sampler (APS) that learns to sample challenging paths that force the navigator to improve based on the navigation performance. APS also serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's ability to generalize. We evaluate the influence of APS on the performance of different VLN baseline models using the room-to-room dataset (R2R). The results show that the adversarial training process with our proposed APS benefits VLN models under both seen and unseen environments. And the pre-exploration process can further gain additional improvements under unseen environments."
1911.08303,Lightweight Residual Network for The Classification of Thyroid Nodules,"Ultrasound is a useful technique for diagnosing thyroid nodules. Benign and malignant nodules that automatically discriminate in the ultrasound pictures can provide diagnostic recommendations or, improve diagnostic accuracy in the absence of specialists. The main issue here is how to collect suitable features for this particular task. We suggest here a technique for extracting features from ultrasound pictures based on the Residual U-net. We attempt to introduce significant semantic characteristics to the classification. Our model gained 95% classification accuracy."
1911.08708,Take an Emotion Walk: Perceiving Emotions from Gaits Using Hierarchical   Attention Pooling and Affective Mapping,"We present an autoencoder-based semi-supervised approach to classify perceived human emotions from walking styles obtained from videos or motion-captured data and represented as sequences of 3D poses. Given the motion on each joint in the pose at each time step extracted from 3D pose sequences, we hierarchically pool these joint motions in a bottom-up manner in the encoder, following the kinematic chains in the human body. We also constrain the latent embeddings of the encoder to contain the space of psychologically-motivated affective features underlying the gaits. We train the decoder to reconstruct the motions per joint per time step in a top-down manner from the latent embeddings. For the annotated data, we also train a classifier to map the latent embeddings to emotion labels. Our semi-supervised approach achieves a mean average precision of 0.84 on the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset, which contains both labeled and unlabeled gaits collected from multiple sources. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for both emotion recognition and action recognition from 3D gaits by 7%--23% on the absolute. More importantly, we improve the average precision by 10%--50% on the absolute on classes that each makes up less than 25% of the labeled part of the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset."
1911.10335,Attention Deep Model with Multi-Scale Deep Supervision for Person   Re-Identification,"In recent years, person re-identification (PReID) has become a hot topic in computer vision duo to it is an important part in intelligent surveillance. Many state-of-the-art PReID methods are attention-based or multi-scale feature learning deep models. However, introducing attention mechanism may lead to some important feature information losing issue. Besides, most of the multi-scale models embedding the multi-scale feature learning block into the feature extraction deep network, which reduces the efficiency of inference network. To address these issue, in this study, we introduce an attention deep architecture with multi-scale deep supervision for PReID. Technically, we contribute a reverse attention block to complement the attention block, and a novel multi-scale layer with deep supervision operator for training the backbone network. The proposed block and operator are only used for training, and discard in test phase. Experiments have been performed on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets. All the experiment results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the other competitive state-of-the-art methods."
1911.11250,A Novel Visual Fault Detection and Classification System for   Semiconductor Manufacturing Using Stacked Hybrid Convolutional Neural   Networks,"Automated visual inspection in the semiconductor industry aims to detect and classify manufacturing defects utilizing modern image processing techniques. While an earliest possible detection of defect patterns allows quality control and automation of manufacturing chains, manufacturers benefit from an increased yield and reduced manufacturing costs. Since classical image processing systems are limited in their ability to detect novel defect patterns, and machine learning approaches often involve a tremendous amount of computational effort, this contribution introduces a novel deep neural network based hybrid approach. Unlike classical deep neural networks, a multi-stage system allows the detection and classification of the finest structures in pixel size within high-resolution imagery. Consisting of stacked hybrid convolutional neural networks (SH-CNN) and inspired by current approaches of visual attention, the realized system draws the focus over the level of detail from its structures to more task-relevant areas of interest. The results of our test environment show that the SH-CNN outperforms current approaches of learning-based automated visual inspection, whereas a distinction depending on the level of detail enables the elimination of defect patterns in earlier stages of the manufacturing process."
1911.11251,Hexagonal Image Processing in the Context of Machine Learning:   Conception of a Biologically Inspired Hexagonal Deep Learning Framework,"Inspired by the human visual perception system, hexagonal image processing in the context of machine learning deals with the development of image processing systems that combine the advantages of evolutionary motivated structures based on biological models. While conventional state-of-the-art image processing systems of recording and output devices almost exclusively utilize square arranged methods, their hexagonal counterparts offer a number of key advantages that can benefit both researchers and users. This contribution serves as a general application-oriented approach the synthesis of the therefore designed hexagonal image processing framework, called Hexnet, the processing steps of hexagonal image transformation, and dependent methods. The results of our created test environment show that the realized framework surpasses current approaches of hexagonal image processing systems, while hexagonal artificial neural networks can benefit from the implemented hexagonal architecture. As hexagonal lattice format based deep neural networks, also called H-DNN, can be compared to their square counterparts by transforming classical square lattice based data sets into their hexagonal representation, they can also result in a reduction of trainable parameters as well as result in increased training and test rates."
1912.01067,A Bayesian Inference Framework for Procedural Material Parameter   Estimation,"Procedural material models have been gaining traction in many applications thanks to their flexibility, compactness, and easy editability. We explore the inverse rendering problem of procedural material parameter estimation from photographs, presenting a unified view of the problem in a Bayesian framework. In addition to computing point estimates of the parameters by optimization, our framework uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to sample the space of plausible material parameters, providing a collection of plausible matches that a user can choose from, and efficiently handling both discrete and continuous model parameters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we fit procedural models of a range of materials---wall plaster, leather, wood, anisotropic brushed metals and layered metallic paints---to both synthetic and real target images."
1912.01181,Learning Multi-resolution Graph Edge Embedding for Discovering Brain   Network Dysfunction in Neurological Disorders,"Tremendous recent literature show that associations between different brain regions, i.e., brain connectivity, provide early symptoms of neurological disorders. Despite significant efforts made for graph neural network (GNN) techniques, their focus on graph nodes makes the state-of-the-art GNN methods not suitable for classifying brain connectivity as graphs where the objective is to characterize disease-relevant network dysfunction patterns on graph links. To address this issue, we propose Multi-resolution Edge Network (MENET) to detect disease-specific connectomic benchmarks with high discrimination power across diagnostic categories. The core of MENET is a novel graph edge-wise transform that we propose, which allows us to capture multi-resolution ``connectomic'' features. Using a rich set of the connectomic features, we devise a graph learning framework to jointly select discriminative edges and assign diagnostic labels for graphs. Experiments on two real datasets show that MENET accurately predicts diagnostic labels and identify brain connectivities highly associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder."
1912.05469,Analysis of effectiveness of thresholding in perfusion ROI detection on   T2-weighted MR images with abnormal brain anatomy,"The brain perfusion ROI detection being a preliminary step, designed to exclude non-brain tissues from analyzed DSC perfusion MR images. Its accuracy is considered as the key factor for delivering correct results of perfusion data analysis. Despite the large variety of algorithms developed on brain tissues segmentation, there is no one that works reliably and robustly on 2T-waited MR images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy. Therefore, thresholding method is still the state-of-the-art technique that is widely used as a way of managing pixels involved in brain perfusion ROI. This paper presents the analysis of effectiveness of thresholding techniques in brain perfusion ROI detection on 2T-waited MR images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy. Four threshold-based algorithms implementation are considered: according to Otsu method as global thresholding, according to Niblack method as local thresholding, thresholding in approximate anatomical brain location, and brute force thresholding. The analysis is done using comparison of qualitative maps produced from thresholded images and from the reference ones. Pearson correlation analysis showed strong positive (r was ranged from 0.7123 to 0.8518, p<0.01) and weak positive (r<0.35, p<0.01) relationship in case of conducted experiments with CBF, CBV, MTT and Tmax maps, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed at level of 95% confidence interval that maps produced from thresholded images were subject to scale and offset errors in all conducted experiments. The experimental results showed that widely used thresholding methods are an ineffective way of managing pixels involved in brain perfusion ROI. Thresholding as brain segmentation tool can lead to poor placement of perfusion ROI and, as a result, produced maps will be subject to artifacts and can cause falsely high or falsely low perfusion parameters assessment."
1912.06931,Asymmetric GANs for Image-to-Image Translation,"Existing models for unsupervised image translation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn the mapping from the source domain to the target domain using a cycle-consistency loss. However, these methods always adopt a symmetric network architecture to learn both forward and backward cycles. Because of the task complexity and cycle input difference between the source and target domains, the inequality in bidirectional forward-backward cycle translations is significant and the amount of information between two domains is different. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of existing symmetric GANs in asymmetric translation tasks, and propose an AsymmetricGAN model with both translation and reconstruction generators of unequal sizes and different parameter-sharing strategy to adapt to the asymmetric need in both unsupervised and supervised image translation tasks. Moreover, the training stage of existing methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images, thus we explore different optimization losses for better training of AsymmetricGAN, making image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised generative tasks with 8 datasets show that AsymmetricGAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance compared with existing GANs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the asymmetric GAN structure on both unsupervised and supervised image translation tasks."
1912.07105,Semantic-Aware Label Placement for Augmented Reality in Street View,"In an augmented reality (AR) application, placing labels in a manner that is clear and readable without occluding the critical information from the real-world can be a challenging problem. This paper introduces a label placement technique for AR used in street view scenarios. We propose a semantic-aware task-specific label placement method by identifying potentially important image regions through a novel feature map, which we refer to as guidance map. Given an input image, its saliency information, semantic information and the task-specific importance prior are integrated into the guidance map for our labeling task. To learn the task prior, we created a label placement dataset with the users' labeling preferences, as well as use it for evaluation. Our solution encodes the constraints for placing labels in an optimization problem to obtain the final label layout, and the labels will be placed in appropriate positions to reduce the chances of overlaying important real-world objects in street view AR scenarios. The experimental validation shows clearly the benefits of our method over previous solutions in the AR street view navigation and similar applications."
1912.07329,Pneumothorax Segmentation: Deep Learning Image Segmentation to predict   Pneumothorax,"Computer vision has shown promising results in medical image processing. Pneumothorax is a deadly condition and if not diagnosed and treated at time then it causes death. It can be diagnosed with chest X-ray images. We need an expert and experienced radiologist to predict whether a person is suffering from pneumothorax or not by looking at the chest X-ray images. Everyone does not have access to such a facility. Moreover, in some cases, we need quick diagnoses. So we propose an image segmentation model to predict and give the output a mask that will assist the doctor in taking this crucial decision. Deep Learning has proved their worth in many areas and outperformed man state-of-the-art models. We want to use the power of these deep learning model to solve this problem. We have used U-net [13] architecture with ResNet [17] as a backbone and achieved promising results. U-net [13] performs very well in medical image processing and semantic segmentation. Our problem falls in the semantic segmentation category."
1912.10726,An Urban Water Extraction Method Combining Deep Learning and Google   Earth Engine,"Urban water is important for the urban ecosystem. Accurate and efficient detection of urban water with remote sensing data is of great significance for urban management and planning. In this paper, we proposed a new method to combine Google Earth Engine (GEE) with multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract urban water from Landsat images, which is summarized as offline training and online prediction (OTOP). That is, the training of MSCNN was completed offline, and the process of urban water extraction was implemented on GEE with the trained parameters of MSCNN. The OTOP can give full play to the respective advantages of GEE and CNN, and make the use of deep learning method on GEE more flexible. It can process available satellite images with high performance without data download and storage, and the overall performance of urban water extraction is also higher than that of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and random forest. The mean kappa, F1-score and intersection over union (IoU) of urban water extraction with the OTOP in Changchun, Wuhan, Kunming and Guangzhou reached 0.924, 0.930 and 0.869, respectively. The results of the extended validation in the other major cities of China also show that the OTOP is robust and can be used to extract different types of urban water, which benefits from the structural design and training of the MSCNN. Therefore, the OTOP is especially suitable for the study of large-scale and long-term urban water change detection in the background of urbanization."
1912.11888,W-PoseNet: Dense Correspondence Regularized Pixel Pair Pose Regression,"Solving 6D pose estimation is non-trivial to cope with intrinsic appearance and shape variation and severe inter-object occlusion, and is made more challenging in light of extrinsic large illumination changes and low quality of the acquired data under an uncontrolled environment. This paper introduces a novel pose estimation algorithm W-PoseNet, which densely regresses from input data to 6D pose and also 3D coordinates in model space. In other words, local features learned for pose regression in our deep network are regularized by explicitly learning pixel-wise correspondence mapping onto 3D pose-sensitive coordinates as an auxiliary task. Moreover, a sparse pair combination of pixel-wise features and soft voting on pixel-pair pose predictions are designed to improve robustness to inconsistent and sparse local features. Experiment results on the popular YCB-Video and LineMOD benchmarks show that the proposed W-PoseNet consistently achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms."
1912.12095,Simultaneous 3D Object Segmentation and 6-DOF Pose Estimation,"We propose a single-shot method for simultaneous 3D object segmentation and 6-DOF pose estimation in pure 3D point clouds scenes based on a consensus that \emph{one point only belongs to one object}, i.e., each point has the potential power to predict the 6-DOF pose of its corresponding object. Unlike the recently proposed methods of the similar task, which rely on 2D detectors to predict the projection of 3D corners of the 3D bounding boxes and the 6-DOF pose must be estimated by a PnP like spatial transformation method, ours is concise enough not to require additional spatial transformation between different dimensions. Due to the lack of training data for many objects, the recently proposed 2D detection methods try to generate training data by using rendering engine and achieve good results. However, rendering in 3D space along with 6-DOF is relatively difficult. Therefore, we propose an augmented reality technology to generate the training data in semi-virtual reality 3D space. The key component of our method is a multi-task CNN architecture that can simultaneously predicts the 3D object segmentation and 6-DOF pose estimation in pure 3D point clouds.   For experimental evaluation, we generate expanded training data for two state-of-the-arts 3D object datasets \cite{PLCHF}\cite{TLINEMOD} by using Augmented Reality technology (AR). We evaluate our proposed method on the two datasets. The results show that our method can be well generalized into multiple scenarios and provide performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-arts."
2001.01258,"The troublesome kernel -- On hallucinations, no free lunches and the   accuracy-stability trade-off in inverse problems","Methods inspired by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are starting to fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough performances on challenging problems. However, reliability and trustworthiness of such techniques is a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts; instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant deterioration on others. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these phenomena. We give mathematical explanations for how and when such effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, with several of our results taking the form of `no free lunch' theorems. Specifically, we show that (i) methods that overperform on a single image can wrongly transfer details from one image to another, creating a hallucination, (ii) methods that overperform on two or more images can hallucinate or be unstable, (iii) optimizing the accuracy-stability trade-off is generally difficult, (iv) hallucinations and instabilities, if they occur, are not rare events, and may be encouraged by standard training, (v) it may be impossible to construct optimal reconstruction maps for certain problems. Our results trace these effects to the kernel of the forward operator whenever it is nontrivial, but also apply to the case when the forward operator is ill-conditioned. Based on these insights, our work aims to spur research into new ways to develop robust and reliable AI-based methods for inverse problems in imaging."
2001.02858,An inexact matching approach for the comparison of plane curves with   general elastic metrics,"This paper introduces a new mathematical formulation and numerical approach for the computation of distances and geodesics between immersed planar curves. Our approach combines the general simplifying transform for first-order elastic metrics that was recently introduced by Kurtek and Needham, together with a relaxation of the matching constraint using parametrization-invariant fidelity metrics. The main advantages of this formulation are that it leads to a simple optimization problem for discretized curves, and that it provides a flexible approach to deal with noisy, inconsistent or corrupted data. These benefits are illustrated via a few preliminary numerical results."
2001.03329,Convolutional Neural Networks based Focal Loss for Class Imbalance   Problem: A Case Study of Canine Red Blood Cells Morphology Classification,"Morphologies of red blood cells are normally interpreted by a pathologist. It is time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore, a misclassified red blood cell morphology will lead to false disease diagnosis and improper treatment. Thus, a decent pathologist must truly be an expert in classifying red blood cell morphology. In the past decade, many approaches have been proposed for classifying human red blood cell morphology. However, those approaches have not addressed the class imbalance problem in classification. A class imbalance problem---a problem where the numbers of samples in classes are very different---is one of the problems that can lead to a biased model towards the majority class. Due to the rarity of every type of abnormal blood cell morphology, the data from the collection process are usually imbalanced. In this study, we aimed to solve this problem specifically for classification of dog red blood cell morphology by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)---a well-known deep learning technique---in conjunction with a focal loss function, adept at handling class imbalance problem. The proposed technique was conducted on a well-designed framework: two different CNNs were used to verify the effectiveness of the focal loss function and the optimal hyper-parameters were determined by 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that both CNNs models augmented with the focal loss function achieved higher $F_{1}$-scores, compared to the models augmented with a conventional cross-entropy loss function that does not address class imbalance problem. In other words, the focal loss function truly enabled the CNNs models to be less biased towards the majority class than the cross-entropy did in the classification task of imbalanced dog red blood cell data."
2001.04086,GridMask Data Augmentation,"We propose a novel data augmentation method `GridMask' in this paper. It utilizes information removal to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of computer vision tasks. We analyze the requirement of information dropping. Then we show limitation of existing information dropping algorithms and propose our structured method, which is simple and yet very effective. It is based on the deletion of regions of the input image. Our extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the latest AutoAugment, which is way more computationally expensive due to the use of reinforcement learning to find the best policies. On the ImageNet dataset for recognition, COCO2017 object detection, and on Cityscapes dataset for semantic segmentation, our method all notably improves performance over baselines. The extensive experiments manifest the effectiveness and generality of the new method."
2001.05717,Adaptive Direction-Guided Structure Tensor Total Variation,"Direction-guided structure tensor total variation (DSTV) is a recently proposed regularization term that aims at increasing the sensitivity of the structure tensor total variation (STV) to the changes towards a predetermined direction. Despite of the plausible results obtained on the uni-directional images, the DSTV model is not applicable to the multi-directional images of real-world. In this study, we build a two-stage framework that brings adaptivity to DSTV. We design an alternative to STV, which encodes the first-order information within a local neighborhood under the guidance of spatially varying directional descriptors (i.e., orientation and the dose of anisotropy). In order to estimate those descriptors, we propose an efficient preprocessor that captures the local geometry based on the structure tensor. Through the extensive experiments, we demonstrate how beneficial the involvement of the directional information in STV is, by comparing the proposed method with the state-of-the-art analysis-based denoising models, both in terms of restoration quality and computational efficiency."
2001.05844,Adversarial Example Generation using Evolutionary Multi-objective   Optimization,"This paper proposes Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO)-based Adversarial Example (AE) design method that performs under black-box setting. Previous gradient-based methods produce AEs by changing all pixels of a target image, while previous EC-based method changes small number of pixels to produce AEs. Thanks to EMO's property of population based-search, the proposed method produces various types of AEs involving ones locating between AEs generated by the previous two approaches, which helps to know the characteristics of a target model or to know unknown attack patterns. Experimental results showed the potential of the proposed method, e.g., it can generate robust AEs and, with the aid of DCT-based perturbation pattern generation, AEs for high resolution images."
2001.05858,The problems with using STNs to align CNN feature maps,"Spatial transformer networks (STNs) were designed to enable CNNs to learn invariance to image transformations. STNs were originally proposed to transform CNN feature maps as well as input images. This enables the use of more complex features when predicting transformation parameters. However, since STNs perform a purely spatial transformation, they do not, in the general case, have the ability to align the feature maps of a transformed image and its original. We present a theoretical argument for this and investigate the practical implications, showing that this inability is coupled with decreased classification accuracy. We advocate taking advantage of more complex features in deeper layers by instead sharing parameters between the classification and the localisation network."
2001.07026,Leveraging tensor kernels to reduce objective function mismatch in deep   clustering,"Objective Function Mismatch (OFM) occurs when the optimization of one objective has a negative impact on the optimization of another objective. In this work we study OFM in deep clustering, and find that the popular autoencoder-based approach to deep clustering can lead to both reduced clustering performance, and a significant amount of OFM between the reconstruction and clustering objectives. To reduce the mismatch, while maintaining the structure-preserving property of an auxiliary objective, we propose a set of new auxiliary objectives for deep clustering, referred to as the Unsupervised Companion Objectives (UCOs). The UCOs rely on a kernel function to formulate a clustering objective on intermediate representations in the network. Generally, intermediate representations can include other dimensions, for instance spatial or temporal, in addition to the feature dimension. We therefore argue that the na\""ive approach of vectorizing and applying a vector kernel is suboptimal for such representations, as it ignores the information contained in the other dimensions. To address this drawback, we equip the UCOs with structure-exploiting tensor kernels, designed for tensors of arbitrary rank. The UCOs can thus be adapted to a broad class of network architectures. We also propose a novel, regression-based measure of OFM, allowing us to accurately quantify the amount of OFM observed during training. Our experiments show that the OFM between the UCOs and the main clustering objective is lower, compared to a similar autoencoder-based model. Further, we illustrate that the UCOs improve the clustering performance of the model, in contrast to the autoencoder-based approach. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/danieltrosten/tk-uco."
2002.02997,DropCluster: A structured dropout for convolutional networks,"Dropout as a common regularizer to prevent overfitting in deep neural networks has been less effective in convolutional layers than in fully connected layers. This is because Dropout drops features randomly, without considering local structure. When features are spatially correlated, as in the case of convolutional layers, information from the dropped features can still propagate to subsequent layers via neighboring features. To address this problem, structured forms of Dropout have been proposed. A drawback of these methods is that they do not adapt to the data. In this work, we leverage the structure in the outputs of convolutional layers and introduce a novel structured regularization method named DropCluster. Our approach clusters features in convolutional layers, and drops the resulting clusters randomly during training iterations. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and APPA-REAL datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective and controls overfitting better than other approaches."
2002.04251,2.75D: Boosting learning by representing 3D Medical imaging to 2D   features for small data,"In medical-data driven learning, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have started to show superior performance to 2D CNNs in numerous deep learning tasks, proving the added value of 3D spatial information in feature representation. However, the difficulty in collecting more training samples to converge, more computational resources and longer execution time make this approach less applied. Also, applying transfer learning on 3D CNN is challenging due to a lack of publicly available pre-trained 3D models. To tackle these issues, we proposed a novel 2D strategical representation of volumetric data, namely 2.75D. In this work, the spatial information of 3D images is captured in a single 2D view by a spiral-spinning technique. As a result, 2D CNN networks can also be used to learn volumetric information. Besides, we can fully leverage pre-trained 2D CNNs for downstream vision problems. We also explore a multi-view 2.75D strategy, 2.75D 3 channels (2.75Dx3), to boost the advantage of 2.75D. We evaluated the proposed methods on three public datasets with different modalities or organs (Lung CT, Breast MRI, and Prostate MRI), against their 2D, 2.5D, and 3D counterparts in classification tasks. Results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform other counterparts when all methods were trained from scratch on the lung dataset. Such performance gain is more pronounced with transfer learning or in the case of limited training data. Our methods also achieved comparable performance on other datasets. In addition, our methods achieved a substantial reduction in time consumption of training and inference compared with the 2.5D or 3D method."
2002.04993,Real-Time Semantic Background Subtraction,"Semantic background subtraction SBS has been shown to improve the performance of most background subtraction algorithms by combining them with semantic information, derived from a semantic segmentation network. However, SBS requires high-quality semantic segmentation masks for all frames, which are slow to compute. In addition, most state-of-the-art background subtraction algorithms are not real-time, which makes them unsuitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we present a novel background subtraction algorithm called Real-Time Semantic Background Subtraction (denoted RT-SBS) which extends SBS for real-time constrained applications while keeping similar performances. RT-SBS effectively combines a real-time background subtraction algorithm with high-quality semantic information which can be provided at a slower pace, independently for each pixel. We show that RT-SBS coupled with ViBe sets a new state of the art for real-time background subtraction algorithms and even competes with the non real-time state-of-the-art ones. Note that we provide python CPU and GPU implementations of RT-SBS at https://github.com/cioppaanthony/rt-sbs."
2002.05907,A Survey on 3D Skeleton-Based Action Recognition Using Learning Method,"3D skeleton-based action recognition (3D SAR) has gained significant attention within the computer vision community, owing to the inherent advantages offered by skeleton data. As a result, a plethora of impressive works, including those based on conventional handcrafted features and learned feature extraction methods, have been conducted over the years. However, prior surveys on action recognition have primarily focused on video or RGB data-dominated approaches, with limited coverage of reviews related to skeleton data. Furthermore, despite the extensive application of deep learning methods in this field, there has been a notable absence of research that provides an introductory or comprehensive review from the perspective of deep learning architectures. To address these limitations, this survey first underscores the importance of action recognition and emphasizes the significance of 3D skeleton data as a valuable modality. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive introduction to mainstream action recognition techniques based on four fundamental deep architectures, i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Transformers. All methods with the corresponding architectures are then presented in a data-driven manner with detailed discussion. Finally, we offer insights into the current largest 3D skeleton dataset, NTU-RGB+D, and its new edition, NTU-RGB+D 120, along with an overview of several top-performing algorithms on these datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first comprehensive discussion of deep learning-based action recognition using 3D skeleton data."
2002.06816,On the Similarity of Deep Learning Representations Across Didactic and   Adversarial Examples,"The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) has motivated a parallel endeavor: the design of adversaries that profit from successful misclassifications. However, not all adversarial examples are crafted for malicious purposes. For example, real world systems often contain physical, temporal, and sampling variability across instrumentation. Adversarial examples in the wild may inadvertently prove deleterious for accurate predictive modeling. Conversely, naturally occurring covariance of image features may serve didactic purposes. Here, we studied the stability of deep learning representations for neuroimaging classification across didactic and adversarial conditions characteristic of MRI acquisition variability. We show that representational similarity and performance vary according to the frequency of adversarial examples in the input space."
2003.03081,CNN-based Repetitive self-revised learning for photos' aesthetics   imbalanced classification,"Aesthetic assessment is subjective, and the distribution of the aesthetic levels is imbalanced. In order to realize the auto-assessment of photo aesthetics, we focus on using repetitive self-revised learning (RSRL) to train the CNN-based aesthetics classification network by imbalanced data set. As RSRL, the network is trained repetitively by dropping out the low likelihood photo samples at the middle levels of aesthetics from the training data set based on the previously trained network. Further, the retained two networks are used in extracting highlight regions of the photos related with the aesthetic assessment. Experimental results show that the CNN-based repetitive self-revised learning is effective for improving the performances of the imbalanced classification."
2003.03653,"SalsaNext: Fast, Uncertainty-aware Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point   Clouds for Autonomous Driving","In this paper, we introduce SalsaNext for the uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of a full 3D LiDAR point cloud in real-time. SalsaNext is the next version of SalsaNet [1] which has an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder unit has a set of ResNet blocks and the decoder part combines upsampled features from the residual blocks. In contrast to SalsaNet, we introduce a new context module, replace the ResNet encoder blocks with a new residual dilated convolution stack with gradually increasing receptive fields and add the pixel-shuffle layer in the decoder. Additionally, we switch from stride convolution to average pooling and also apply central dropout treatment. To directly optimize the Jaccard index, we further combine the weighted cross-entropy loss with Lovasz-Softmax loss [2]. We finally inject a Bayesian treatment to compute the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for each point in the cloud. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the Semantic-KITTI dataset [3], which demonstrates that the proposed SalsaNext outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks and ranks first on the Semantic-KITTI leaderboard. We also release our source code https://github.com/TiagoCortinhal/SalsaNext."
2003.06885,Evaluation of Rounding Functions in Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation,"A novel evaluation study of the most appropriate round function for nearest-neighbor (NN) image interpolation is presented. Evaluated rounding functions are selected among the five rounding rules defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754-2008 standard. Both full- and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are used to study and evaluate the influence of rounding functions on NN interpolation image quality. The concept of achieved occurrences over targeted occurrences is used to determine the percentage of achieved occurrences based on the number of test images used. Inferential statistical analysis is applied to deduce from a small number of images and draw a conclusion of the behavior of each rounding function on a bigger number of images. Under the normal distribution and at the level of confidence equals to 95%, the maximum and minimum achievable occurrences by each evaluated rounding function are both provided based on the inferential analysis-based experiments."
2003.06945,Scene Completeness-Aware Lidar Depth Completion for Driving Scenario,"This paper introduces Scene Completeness-Aware Depth Completion (SCADC) to complete raw lidar scans into dense depth maps with fine and complete scene structures. Recent sparse depth completion for lidars only focuses on the lower scenes and produces irregular estimations on the upper because existing datasets, such as KITTI, do not provide groundtruth for upper areas. These areas are considered less important since they are usually sky or trees of less scene understanding interest. However, we argue that in several driving scenarios such as large trucks or cars with loads, objects could extend to the upper parts of scenes. Thus depth maps with structured upper scene estimation are important for RGBD algorithms. SCADC adopts stereo images that produce disparities with better scene completeness but are generally less precise than lidars, to help sparse lidar depth completion. To our knowledge, we are the first to focus on scene completeness of sparse depth completion. We validate our SCADC on both depth estimate precision and scene-completeness on KITTI. Moreover, we experiment on less-explored outdoor RGBD semantic segmentation with scene completeness-aware D-input to validate our method."
2003.07289,VMLoc: Variational Fusion For Learning-Based Multimodal Camera   Localization,"Recent learning-based approaches have achieved impressive results in the field of single-shot camera localization. However, how best to fuse multiple modalities (e.g., image and depth) and to deal with degraded or missing input are less well studied. In particular, we note that previous approaches towards deep fusion do not perform significantly better than models employing a single modality. We conjecture that this is because of the naive approaches to feature space fusion through summation or concatenation which do not take into account the different strengths of each modality. To address this, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed VMLoc, to fuse different sensor inputs into a common latent space through a variational Product-of-Experts (PoE) followed by attention-based fusion. Unlike previous multimodal variational works directly adapting the objective function of vanilla variational auto-encoder, we show how camera localization can be accurately estimated through an unbiased objective function based on importance weighting. Our model is extensively evaluated on RGB-D datasets and the results prove the efficacy of our model. The source code is available at https://github.com/kaichen-z/VMLoc."
2003.08162,3D Crowd Counting via Geometric Attention-guided Multi-View Fusion,"Recently multi-view crowd counting using deep neural networks has been proposed to enable counting in large and wide scenes using multiple cameras. The current methods project the camera-view features to the average-height plane of the 3D world, and then fuse the projected multi-view features to predict a 2D scene-level density map on the ground (i.e., birds-eye view). Unlike the previous research, we consider the variable height of the people in the 3D world and propose to solve the multi-view crowd counting task through 3D feature fusion with 3D scene-level density maps, instead of the 2D density map on the ground plane. Compared to 2D fusion, the 3D fusion extracts more information of the people along the z-dimension (height), which helps to address the scale variations across multiple views. The 3D density maps still preserve the 2D density maps property that the sum is the count, while also providing 3D information about the crowd density. Furthermore, instead of using the standard method of copying the features along the view ray in the 2D-to-3D projection, we propose an attention module based on a height estimation network, which forces each 2D pixel to be projected to one 3D voxel along the view ray. We also explore the projection consistency among the 3D prediction and the ground truth in the 2D views to further enhance the counting performance. The proposed method is tested on the synthetic and real-world multiview counting datasets and achieves better or comparable counting performance to the state-of-the-art."
2003.09018,Human Activity Recognition from Wearable Sensor Data Using   Self-Attention,"Human Activity Recognition from body-worn sensor data poses an inherent challenge in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of time-series signals. In this regard, the existing recurrent or convolutional or their hybrid models for activity recognition struggle to capture spatio-temporal context from the feature space of sensor reading sequence. To address this complex problem, we propose a self-attention based neural network model that foregoes recurrent architectures and utilizes different types of attention mechanisms to generate higher dimensional feature representation used for classification. We performed extensive experiments on four popular publicly available HAR datasets: PAMAP2, Opportunity, Skoda and USC-HAD. Our model achieve significant performance improvement over recent state-of-the-art models in both benchmark test subjects and Leave-one-subject-out evaluation. We also observe that the sensor attention maps produced by our model is able capture the importance of the modality and placement of the sensors in predicting the different activity classes."
2003.10258,Sample-Specific Output Constraints for Neural Networks,"Neural networks reach state-of-the-art performance in a variety of learning tasks. However, a lack of understanding the decision making process yields to an appearance as black box. We address this and propose ConstraintNet, a neural network with the capability to constrain the output space in each forward pass via an additional input. The prediction of ConstraintNet is proven within the specified domain. This enables ConstraintNet to exclude unintended or even hazardous outputs explicitly whereas the final prediction is still learned from data. We focus on constraints in form of convex polytopes and show the generalization to further classes of constraints. ConstraintNet can be constructed easily by modifying existing neural network architectures. We highlight that ConstraintNet is end-to-end trainable with no overhead in the forward and backward pass. For illustration purposes, we model ConstraintNet by modifying a CNN and construct constraints for facial landmark prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application to a follow object controller for vehicles as a safety-critical application. We submitted an approach and system for the generation of safety-critical outputs of an entity based on ConstraintNet at the German Patent and Trademark Office with the official registration mark DE10 2019 119 739."
2003.11846,Weakly-supervised 3D coronary artery reconstruction from two-view   angiographic images,"The reconstruction of three-dimensional models of coronary arteries is of great significance for the localization, evaluation and diagnosis of stenosis and plaque in the arteries, as well as for the assisted navigation of interventional surgery. In the clinical practice, physicians use a few angles of coronary angiography to capture arterial images, so it is of great practical value to perform 3D reconstruction directly from coronary angiography images. However, this is a very difficult computer vision task due to the complex shape of coronary blood vessels, as well as the lack of data set and key point labeling. With the rise of deep learning, more and more work is being done to reconstruct 3D models of human organs from medical images using deep neural networks. We propose an adversarial and generative way to reconstruct three dimensional coronary artery models, from two different views of angiographic images of coronary arteries. With 3D fully supervised learning and 2D weakly supervised learning schemes, we obtained reconstruction accuracies that outperform state-of-art techniques."
2003.13648,Weakly-supervised land classification for coastal zone based on deep   convolutional neural networks by incorporating dual-polarimetric   characteristics into training dataset,"In this work we explore the performance of DCNNs on semantic segmentation using spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) datasets. The semantic segmentation task using PolSAR data can be categorized as weakly supervised learning when the characteristics of SAR data and data annotating procedures are factored in. Datasets are initially analyzed for selecting feasible pre-training images. Then the differences between spaceborne and airborne datasets are examined in terms of spatial resolution and viewing geometry. In this study we used two dual-polarimetric images acquired by TerraSAR-X DLR. A novel method to produce training dataset with more supervised information is developed. Specifically, a series of typical classified images as well as intensity images serve as training datasets. A field survey is conducted for an area of about 20 square kilometers to obtain a ground truth dataset used for accuracy evaluation. Several transfer learning strategies are made for aforementioned training datasets which will be combined in a practicable order. Three DCNN models, including SegNet, U-Net, and LinkNet, are implemented next."
2004.01536,Exploring the ability of CNNs to generalise to previously unseen scales   over wide scale ranges,"The ability to handle large scale variations is crucial for many real world visual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network is to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale channels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight sharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over the outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale channel networks to generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale ranges has, however, not previously been explored. We, therefore, present a theoretical analysis of invariance and covariance properties of scale channel networks and perform an experimental evaluation of the ability of different types of scale channel networks to generalise to previously unseen scales. We identify limitations of previous approaches and propose a new type of foveated scale channel architecture, where the scale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing resolution. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost identically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single scale training data, and do also give improvements in the small sample regime."
2004.04454,TensorProjection Layer: A Tensor-Based Dimension Reduction Method in   Deep Neural Networks,"In this paper, we propose a dimension reduction method specifically designed for tensor-structured feature data in deep neural networks. The method is implemented as a hidden layer, called the TensorProjection layer, which transforms input tensors into output tensors with reduced dimensions through mode-wise projections. The projection directions are treated as model parameters of the layer and are optimized during model training. Our method can serve as an alternative to pooling layers for summarizing image data, or to convolutional layers as a technique for reducing the number of channels. We conduct experiments on tasks such as medical image classification and segmentation, integrating the TensorProjection layer into commonly used baseline architectures to evaluate its effectiveness. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method can outperform traditional downsampling methods, such as pooling layers, in our tasks, suggesting it as a promising alternative for feature summarization."
2004.05704,Visual Grounding Methods for VQA are Working for the Wrong Reasons!,"Existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) methods tend to exploit dataset biases and spurious statistical correlations, instead of producing right answers for the right reasons. To address this issue, recent bias mitigation methods for VQA propose to incorporate visual cues (e.g., human attention maps) to better ground the VQA models, showcasing impressive gains. However, we show that the performance improvements are not a result of improved visual grounding, but a regularization effect which prevents over-fitting to linguistic priors. For instance, we find that it is not actually necessary to provide proper, human-based cues; random, insensible cues also result in similar improvements. Based on this observation, we propose a simpler regularization scheme that does not require any external annotations and yet achieves near state-of-the-art performance on VQA-CPv2."
2004.06970,Roommate Compatibility Detection Through Machine Learning Techniques,"Our objective is to develop an artificially intelligent system which aims at checking the compatibility between the roommates of same or different sex sharing a common area of residence. There are a few key factors determining one's compatibility with the other person. Interpersonal behaviour , situational awareness, communication skills. Here we are trying to build a system that evaluates user on these key factors not via pen paper test but through a highly engaging set of questions and answers. Hence using these scores as an input to our machine learning algorithm which is based on previous trends to come up with percentage probability of user being compatible with another user. With the growing population there is always a challenge for organisation and educational institutions to make the students and their employees more and more productive and in such cases a person's social environment comes into play. A person may be a genius but as long as he is not able to work well with his peers there will always be a chance of more productive performance. It is a well-established fact that human are and have always been a social animal and this has helped in creating communities of like-minded people. Many times, even when there are a large no of people employed to do a particular task the result may not be as expected as people may not compatible in working with one another. This at the end creates performance gaps, hinders organisation success and in many cases loss of precious resources. Our intent is not to remove the non-compatible people from the picture but to find out the perfect compatible match for the person elsewhere that will not only save the resources will also enable effective use of resources. Through the use of various machine learning classification techniques, we intent to do this."
2004.09420,Computer Vision For COVID-19 Control: A Survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an urgent need to contribute to the fight against an immense threat to the human population. Computer Vision, as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, has enjoyed recent success in solving various complex problems in health care and has the potential to contribute to the fight of controlling COVID-19. In response to this call, computer vision researchers are putting their knowledge base at work to devise effective ways to counter COVID-19 challenge and serve the global community. New contributions are being shared with every passing day. It motivated us to review the recent work, collect information about available research resources and an indication of future research directions. We want to make it available to computer vision researchers to save precious time. This survey paper is intended to provide a preliminary review of the available literature on the computer vision efforts against COVID-19 pandemic."
2004.11186,BIT-VO: Visual Odometry at 300 FPS using Binary Features from the Focal   Plane,"Focal-plane Sensor-processor (FPSP) is a next-generation camera technology which enables every pixel on the sensor chip to perform computation in parallel, on the focal plane where the light intensity is captured. SCAMP-5 is a general-purpose FPSP used in this work and it carries out computations in the analog domain before analog to digital conversion. By extracting features from the image on the focal plane, data which is digitized and transferred is reduced. As a consequence, SCAMP-5 offers a high frame rate while maintaining low energy consumption. Here, we present BIT-VO, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 6 Degrees of Freedom visual odometry algorithm which utilises the FPSP. Our entire system operates at 300 FPS in a natural scene, using binary edges and corner features detected by the SCAMP-5."
2004.11678,"Understanding when spatial transformer networks do not support   invariance, and what to do about it","Spatial transformer networks (STNs) were designed to enable convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn invariance to image transformations. STNs were originally proposed to transform CNN feature maps as well as input images. This enables the use of more complex features when predicting transformation parameters. However, since STNs perform a purely spatial transformation, they do not, in the general case, have the ability to align the feature maps of a transformed image with those of its original. STNs are therefore unable to support invariance when transforming CNN feature maps. We present a simple proof for this and study the practical implications, showing that this inability is coupled with decreased classification accuracy. We therefore investigate alternative STN architectures that make use of complex features. We find that while deeper localization networks are difficult to train, localization networks that share parameters with the classification network remain stable as they grow deeper, which allows for higher classification accuracy on difficult datasets. Finally, we explore the interaction between localization network complexity and iterative image alignment."
2004.13324,Learning Feature Descriptors using Camera Pose Supervision,"Recent research on learned visual descriptors has shown promising improvements in correspondence estimation, a key component of many 3D vision tasks. However, existing descriptor learning frameworks typically require ground-truth correspondences between feature points for training, which are challenging to acquire at scale. In this paper we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework that can learn feature descriptors solely from relative camera poses between images. To do so, we devise both a new loss function that exploits the epipolar constraint given by camera poses, and a new model architecture that makes the whole pipeline differentiable and efficient. Because we no longer need pixel-level ground-truth correspondences, our framework opens up the possibility of training on much larger and more diverse datasets for better and unbiased descriptors. We call the resulting descriptors CAmera Pose Supervised, or CAPS, descriptors. Though trained with weak supervision, CAPS descriptors outperform even prior fully-supervised descriptors and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of geometric tasks.

2004.14716,Inability of spatial transformations of CNN feature maps to support   invariant recognition,"A large number of deep learning architectures use spatial transformations of CNN feature maps or filters to better deal with variability in object appearance caused by natural image transformations. In this paper, we prove that spatial transformations of CNN feature maps cannot align the feature maps of a transformed image to match those of its original, for general affine transformations, unless the extracted features are themselves invariant. Our proof is based on elementary analysis for both the single- and multi-layer network case. The results imply that methods based on spatial transformations of CNN feature maps or filters cannot replace image alignment of the input and cannot enable invariant recognition for general affine transformations, specifically not for scaling transformations or shear transformations. For rotations and reflections, spatially transforming feature maps or filters can enable invariance but only for networks with learnt or hardcoded rotation- or reflection-invariant features"
2005.00976,A Concise yet Effective model for Non-Aligned Incomplete Multi-view and   Missing Multi-label Learning,"In reality, learning from multi-view multi-label data inevitably confronts three challenges: missing labels, incomplete views, and non-aligned views. Existing methods mainly concern the first two and commonly need multiple assumptions to attack them, making even state-of-the-arts involve at least two explicit hyper-parameters such that model selection is quite difficult. More roughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing the three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least assumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one hyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only the consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden among multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle the first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same individual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to battle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local structures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number of samples is established. Finally, even without view-alignment, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-arts with view-alignment on five real datasets."
2005.02155,MatriVasha: A Multipurpose Comprehensive Database for Bangla Handwritten   Compound Characters,"At present, recognition of the Bangla handwriting compound character has been an essential issue for many years. In recent years there have been application-based researches in machine learning, and deep learning, which is gained interest, and most notably is handwriting recognition because it has a tremendous application such as Bangla OCR. MatrriVasha, the project which can recognize Bangla, handwritten several compound characters. Currently, compound character recognition is an important topic due to its variant application, and helps to create old forms, and information digitization with reliability. But unfortunately, there is a lack of a comprehensive dataset that can categorize all types of Bangla compound characters. MatrriVasha is an attempt to align compound character, and it's challenging because each person has a unique style of writing shapes. After all, MatrriVasha has proposed a dataset that intends to recognize Bangla 120(one hundred twenty) compound characters that consist of 2552(two thousand five hundred fifty-two) isolated handwritten characters written unique writers which were collected from within Bangladesh. This dataset faced problems in terms of the district, age, and gender-based written related research because the samples were collected that includes a verity of the district, age group, and the equal number of males, and females. As of now, our proposed dataset is so far the most extensive dataset for Bangla compound characters. It is intended to frame the acknowledgment technique for handwritten Bangla compound character. In the future, this dataset will be made publicly available to help to widen the research."
2005.02313,Adversarial Training against Location-Optimized Adversarial Patches,"Deep neural networks have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible changes constructed to cause mis-classification in otherwise highly accurate image classifiers. As a practical alternative, recent work proposed so-called adversarial patches: clearly visible, but adversarially crafted rectangular patches in images. These patches can easily be printed and applied in the physical world. While defenses against imperceptible adversarial examples have been studied extensively, robustness against adversarial patches is poorly understood. In this work, we first devise a practical approach to obtain adversarial patches while actively optimizing their location within the image. Then, we apply adversarial training on these location-optimized adversarial patches and demonstrate significantly improved robustness on CIFAR10 and GTSRB. Additionally, in contrast to adversarial training on imperceptible adversarial examples, our adversarial patch training does not reduce accuracy."
2005.05274,Normalized Convolutional Neural Network,"We introduce a Normalized Convolutional Neural Layer, a novel approach to normalization in convolutional networks. Unlike conventional methods, this layer normalizes the rows of the im2col matrix during convolution, making it inherently adaptive to sliced inputs and better aligned with kernel structures. This distinctive approach differentiates it from standard normalization techniques and prevents direct integration into existing deep learning frameworks optimized for traditional convolution operations. Our method has a universal property, making it applicable to any deep learning task involving convolutional layers. By inherently normalizing within the convolution process, it serves as a convolutional adaptation of Self-Normalizing Networks, maintaining their core principles without requiring additional normalization layers. Notably, in micro-batch training scenarios, it consistently outperforms other batch-independent normalization methods. This performance boost arises from standardizing the rows of the im2col matrix, which theoretically leads to a smoother loss gradient and improved training stability."
2005.05535,"DeepFaceLab: Integrated, flexible and extensible face-swapping framework","Deepfake defense not only requires the research of detection but also requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline, through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For more information, please visit:https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/."
2005.06111,Project RISE: Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions,"Industrial smoke emissions pose a significant concern to human health. Prior works have shown that using Computer Vision (CV) techniques to identify smoke as visual evidence can influence the attitude of regulators and empower citizens to pursue environmental justice. However, existing datasets are not of sufficient quality nor quantity to train the robust CV models needed to support air quality advocacy. We introduce RISE, the first large-scale video dataset for Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions. We adopted a citizen science approach to collaborate with local community members to annotate whether a video clip has smoke emissions. Our dataset contains 12,567 clips from 19 distinct views from cameras that monitored three industrial facilities. These daytime clips span 30 days over two years, including all four seasons. We ran experiments using deep neural networks to establish a strong performance baseline and reveal smoke recognition challenges. Our survey study discussed community feedback, and our data analysis displayed opportunities for integrating citizen scientists and crowd workers into the application of Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact."
2005.06583,Do Saliency Models Detect Odd-One-Out Targets? New Datasets and   Evaluations,"Recent advances in the field of saliency have concentrated on fixation prediction, with benchmarks reaching saturation. However, there is an extensive body of works in psychology and neuroscience that describe aspects of human visual attention that might not be adequately captured by current approaches. Here, we investigate singleton detection, which can be thought of as a canonical example of salience. We introduce two novel datasets, one with psychophysical patterns and one with natural odd-one-out stimuli. Using these datasets we demonstrate through extensive experimentation that nearly all saliency algorithms do not adequately respond to singleton targets in synthetic and natural images. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of training state-of-the-art CNN-based saliency models on these types of stimuli and conclude that the additional training data does not lead to a significant improvement of their ability to find odd-one-out targets. Datasets are available at http://data.nvision2.eecs.yorku.ca/P3O3/."
2005.08644,Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Neural Network Based Methods   With Federated Learning,"Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. Such a condition is traditionally diagnosed by highly-trained specialists analyzing computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient and identifying the location and type of hemorrhage if one exists. We propose a neural network approach to find and classify the condition based upon the CT scan. The model architecture implements a time distributed convolutional network. We observed accuracy above 92% from such an architecture, provided enough data. We propose further extensions to our approach involving the deployment of federated learning. This would be helpful in pooling learned parameters without violating the inherent privacy of the data involved."
2005.09964,Iterative Network for Image Super-Resolution,"Single image super-resolution (SISR), as a traditional ill-conditioned inverse problem, has been greatly revitalized by the recent development of convolutional neural networks (CNN). These CNN-based methods generally map a low-resolution image to its corresponding high-resolution version with sophisticated network structures and loss functions, showing impressive performances. This paper provides a new insight on conventional SISR algorithm, and proposes a substantially different approach relying on the iterative optimization. A novel iterative super-resolution network (ISRN) is proposed on top of the iterative optimization. We first analyze the observation model of image SR problem, inspiring a feasible solution by mimicking and fusing each iteration in a more general and efficient manner. Considering the drawbacks of batch normalization, we propose a feature normalization (F-Norm, FN) method to regulate the features in network. Furthermore, a novel block with FN is developed to improve the network representation, termed as FNB. Residual-in-residual structure is proposed to form a very deep network, which groups FNBs with a long skip connection for better information delivery and stabling the training phase. Extensive experimental results on testing benchmarks with bicubic (BI) degradation show our ISRN can not only recover more structural information, but also achieve competitive or better PSNR/SSIM results with much fewer parameters compared to other works. Besides BI, we simulate the real-world degradation with blur-downscale (BD) and downscale-noise (DN). ISRN and its extension ISRN+ both achieve better performance than others with BD and DN degradation models."
2005.10310,Maplets: An Efficient Approach for Cooperative SLAM Map Building Under   Communication and Computation Constraints,"This article introduces an approach to facilitate cooperative exploration and mapping of large-scale, near-ground, underground, or indoor spaces via a novel integration framework for locally-dense agent map data. The effort targets limited Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) agents with an emphasis on limiting required communications and redundant processing. The approach uses a unique organization of batch optimization engines to enable a highly efficient two-tier optimization structure. Tier I consist of agents that create and potentially share local maplets (local maps, limited in size) which are generated using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) map-building software and then marginalized to a more compact parameterization. Maplets are generated in an overlapping manner and used to estimate the transform and uncertainty between those overlapping maplets, providing accurate and compact odometry or delta-pose representation between maplet's local frames. The delta poses can be shared between agents, and in cases where maplets have salient features (for loop closures), the compact representation of the maplet can also be shared.   The second optimization tier consists of a global optimizer that seeks to optimize those maplet-to-maplet transformations, including any loop closures identified. This can provide an accurate global ""skeleton""' of the traversed space without operating on the high-density point cloud. This compact version of the map data allows for scalable, cooperative exploration with limited communication requirements where most of the individual maplets, or low fidelity renderings, are only shared if desired."
2005.12573,Learning Global and Local Features of Normal Brain Anatomy for   Unsupervised Abnormality Detection,"In real-world clinical practice, overlooking unanticipated findings can result in serious consequences. However, supervised learning, which is the foundation for the current success of deep learning, only encourages models to identify abnormalities that are defined in datasets in advance. Therefore, abnormality detection must be implemented in medical images that are not limited to a specific disease category. In this study, we demonstrate an unsupervised learning framework for pixel-wise abnormality detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging captured from a patient population with metastatic brain tumor. Our concept is as follows: If an image reconstruction network can faithfully reproduce the global features of normal anatomy, then the abnormal lesions in unseen images can be identified based on the local difference from those reconstructed as normal by a discriminative network. Both networks are trained on a dataset comprising only normal images without labels. In addition, we devise a metric to evaluate the anatomical fidelity of the reconstructed images and confirm that the overall detection performance is improved when the image reconstruction network achieves a higher score. For evaluation, clinically significant abnormalities are comprehensively segmented. The results show that the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values for metastatic brain tumors, extracranial metastatic tumors, postoperative cavities, and structural changes are 0.78, 0.61, 0.91, and 0.60, respectively."
2005.13061,Prediction of Thrombectomy Functional Outcomes using Multimodal Data,"Recent randomised clinical trials have shown that patients with ischaemic stroke {due to occlusion of a large intracranial blood vessel} benefit from endovascular thrombectomy. However, predicting outcome of treatment in an individual patient remains a challenge. We propose a novel deep learning approach to directly exploit multimodal data (clinical metadata information, imaging data, and imaging biomarkers extracted from images) to estimate the success of endovascular treatment. We incorporate an attention mechanism in our architecture to model global feature inter-dependencies, both channel-wise and spatially. We perform comparative experiments using unimodal and multimodal data, to predict functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, mRS) and achieve 0.75 AUC for dichotomised mRS scores and 0.35 classification accuracy for individual mRS scores."
2006.02379,The Neural Tangent Link Between CNN Denoisers and Non-Local Filters,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are now a well-established tool for solving computational imaging problems. Modern CNN-based algorithms obtain state-of-the-art performance in diverse image restoration problems. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that, despite being highly overparameterized, networks trained with a single corrupted image can still perform as well as fully trained networks. We introduce a formal link between such networks through their neural tangent kernel (NTK), and well-known non-local filtering techniques, such as non-local means or BM3D. The filtering function associated with a given network architecture can be obtained in closed form without need to train the network, being fully characterized by the random initialization of the network weights. While the NTK theory accurately predicts the filter associated with networks trained using standard gradient descent, our analysis shows that it falls short to explain the behaviour of networks trained using the popular Adam optimizer. The latter achieves a larger change of weights in hidden layers, adapting the non-local filtering function during training. We evaluate our findings via extensive image denoising experiments."
2006.02570,Exploration of Interpretability Techniques for Deep COVID-19   Classification using Chest X-ray Images,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has shocked the entire world with its fairly rapid spread and has challenged different sectors. One of the most effective ways to limit its spread is the early and accurate diagnosing infected patients. Medical imaging, such as X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT), combined with the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), plays an essential role in supporting medical personnel in the diagnosis process. Thus, in this article five different deep learning models (ResNet18, ResNet34, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 and DenseNet161) and their ensemble, using majority voting have been used to classify COVID-19, pneumoni{\ae} and healthy subjects using chest X-ray images. Multilabel classification was performed to predict multiple pathologies for each patient, if present. Firstly, the interpretability of each of the networks was thoroughly studied using local interpretability methods - occlusion, saliency, input X gradient, guided backpropagation, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT, and using a global technique - neuron activation profiles. The mean Micro-F1 score of the models for COVID-19 classifications ranges from 0.66 to 0.875, and is 0.89 for the ensemble of the network models. The qualitative results showed that the ResNets were the most interpretable models. This research demonstrates the importance of using interpretability methods to compare different models before making a decision regarding the best performing model."
2006.05470,Standardised convolutional filtering for radiomics,"The Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI) aims to improve reproducibility of radiomics studies by standardising the computational process of extracting image biomarkers (features) from images. We have previously established reference values for 169 commonly used features, created a standard radiomics image processing scheme, and developed reporting guidelines for radiomic studies. However, several aspects are not standardised. Here we present a complete version of a reference manual on the use of convolutional filters in radiomics and quantitative image analysis. Filters, such as wavelets or Laplacian of Gaussian filters, play an important part in emphasising specific image characteristics such as edges and blobs. Features derived from filter response maps were found to be poorly reproducible. This reference manual provides definitions for convolutional filters, parameters that should be reported, reference feature values, and tests to verify software compliance with the reference standard."
2006.06869,Feudal Steering: Hierarchical Learning for Steering Angle Prediction,"We consider the challenge of automated steering angle prediction for self driving cars using egocentric road images. In this work, we explore the use of feudal networks, used in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), to devise a vehicle agent to predict steering angles from first person, dash-cam images of the Udacity driving dataset. Our method, Feudal Steering, is inspired by recent work in HRL consisting of a manager network and a worker network that operate on different temporal scales and have different goals. The manager works at a temporal scale that is relatively coarse compared to the worker and has a higher level, task-oriented goal space. Using feudal learning to divide the task into manager and worker sub-networks provides more accurate and robust prediction. Temporal abstraction in driving allows more complex primitives than the steering angle at a single time instance. Composite actions comprise a subroutine or skill that can be re-used throughout the driving sequence. The associated subroutine id is the manager network's goal, so that the manager seeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right turn, a slight right turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered by traffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker network output which is regulated by the manager's high level task. We demonstrate state-of-the art steering angle prediction results on the Udacity dataset."
2006.07796,Structure by Architecture: Structured Representations without   Regularization,"We study the problem of self-supervised structured representation learning using autoencoders for downstream tasks such as generative modeling. Unlike most methods which rely on matching an arbitrary, relatively unstructured, prior distribution for sampling, we propose a sampling technique that relies solely on the independence of latent variables, thereby avoiding the trade-off between reconstruction quality and generative performance typically observed in VAEs. We design a novel autoencoder architecture capable of learning a structured representation without the need for aggressive regularization. Our structural decoders learn a hierarchy of latent variables, thereby ordering the information without any additional regularization or supervision. We demonstrate how these models learn a representation that improves results in a variety of downstream tasks including generation, disentanglement, and extrapolation using several challenging and natural image datasets."
2006.07802,Geometry-Aware Instance Segmentation with Disparity Maps,"Most previous works of outdoor instance segmentation for images only use color information. We explore a novel direction of sensor fusion to exploit stereo cameras. Geometric information from disparities helps separate overlapping objects of the same or different classes. Moreover, geometric information penalizes region proposals with unlikely 3D shapes thus suppressing false positive detections. Mask regression is based on 2D, 2.5D, and 3D ROI using the pseudo-lidar and image-based representations. These mask predictions are fused by a mask scoring process. However, public datasets only adopt stereo systems with shorter baseline and focal legnth, which limit measuring ranges of stereo cameras. We collect and utilize High-Quality Driving Stereo (HQDS) dataset, using much longer baseline and focal length with higher resolution. Our performance attains state of the art.

2006.08198,AutoGAN-Distiller: Searching to Compress Generative Adversarial Networks,"The compression of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has lately drawn attention, due to the increasing demand for deploying GANs into mobile devices for numerous applications such as image translation, enhancement and editing. However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models. We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives. Our codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/AGD."
2006.10125,Sustainable Recreational Fishing Using a Novel Electrical Muscle   Stimulation (EMS) Lure and Ensemble Network Algorithm to Maximize Catch and   Release Survivability,"With 200-700 million anglers in the world, sportfishing is nearly five times more common than commercial trawling. Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of jobs are linked to the sportfishing industry, which generates billions of dollars for water-side communities and fisheries conservatories alike. However, the sheer popularity of recreational fishing poses threats to aquatic biodiversity that are hard to regulate. For example, as much as 25% of overfished populations can be traced to anglers. This alarming statistic is explained by the average catch and release mortality rate of 43%, which primarily results from hook-related injuries and careless out-of-water handling. The provisional-patented design proposed in this paper addresses both these problems separately First, a novel, electrical muscle stimulation based fishing lure is proposed as a harmless and low cost alternative to sharp hooks. Early prototypes show a constant electrical current of 90 mA applied through a 200g European perch's jaw can support a reeling tension of 2N - safely within the necessary ranges. Second, a fish-eye camera bob is designed to wirelessly relay underwater footage to a smartphone app, where an ensemble convolutional neural network automatically classifies the fish's species, estimates its length, and cross references with local and state fishing regulations (ie. minimum size, maximum bag limit, and catch season). This capability reduces overfishing by helping anglers avoid accidentally violating guidelines and eliminates the need to reel the fish in and expose it to negligent handling. IN conjunction, this cheap, lightweight, yet high-tech invention is a paradigm shift in preserving a world favorite pastime; while at the same time making recreational fishing more sustainable."
2006.12075,MotioNet: 3D Human Motion Reconstruction from Monocular Video with   Skeleton Consistency,"We introduce MotioNet, a deep neural network that directly reconstructs the motion of a 3D human skeleton from monocular video.While previous methods rely on either rigging or inverse kinematics (IK) to associate a consistent skeleton with temporally coherent joint rotations, our method is the first data-driven approach that directly outputs a kinematic skeleton, which is a complete, commonly used, motion representation. At the crux of our approach lies a deep neural network with embedded kinematic priors, which decomposes sequences of 2D joint positions into two separate attributes: a single, symmetric, skeleton, encoded by bone lengths, and a sequence of 3D joint rotations associated with global root positions and foot contact labels. These attributes are fed into an integrated forward kinematics (FK) layer that outputs 3D positions, which are compared to a ground truth. In addition, an adversarial loss is applied to the velocities of the recovered rotations, to ensure that they lie on the manifold of natural joint rotations. The key advantage of our approach is that it learns to infer natural joint rotations directly from the training data, rather than assuming an underlying model, or inferring them from joint positions using a data-agnostic IK solver. We show that enforcing a single consistent skeleton along with temporally coherent joint rotations constrains the solution space, leading to a more robust handling of self-occlusions and depth ambiguities."
2006.14347,Epoch-evolving Gaussian Process Guided Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel learning scheme called epoch-evolving Gaussian Process Guided Learning (GPGL), which aims at characterizing the correlation information between the batch-level distribution and the global data distribution. Such correlation information is encoded as context labels and needs renewal every epoch. With the guidance of the context label and ground truth label, GPGL scheme provides a more efficient optimization through updating the model parameters with a triangle consistency loss. Furthermore, our GPGL scheme can be further generalized and naturally applied to the current deep models, outperforming the existing batch-based state-of-the-art models on mainstream datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) remarkably."
2006.14738,Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks with Perceptual Loss for Low Dose   CT Denoising,"Low Dose CT Denoising research aims to reduce the risks of radiation exposure to patients. Recently researchers have used deep learning to denoise low dose CT images with promising results. However, approaches that use mean-squared-error (MSE) tend to over smooth the image resulting in loss of fine structural details in low contrast regions of the image. These regions are often crucial for diagnosis and must be preserved in order for Low dose CT to be used effectively in practice. In this work we use a cascade of two neural networks, the first of which aims to reconstruct normal dose CT from low dose CT by minimizing perceptual loss, and the second which predicts the difference between the ground truth and prediction from the perceptual loss network. We show that our method outperforms related works and more effectively reconstructs fine structural details in low contrast regions of the image."
2006.15524,MgSvF: Multi-Grained Slow vs. Fast Framework for Few-Shot   Class-Incremental Learning,"As a challenging problem, few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) continually learns a sequence of tasks, confronting the dilemma between slow forgetting of old knowledge and fast adaptation to new knowledge. In this paper, we concentrate on this ""slow vs. fast"" (SvF) dilemma to determine which knowledge components to be updated in a slow fashion or a fast fashion, and thereby balance old-knowledge preservation and new-knowledge adaptation. We propose a multi-grained SvF learning strategy to cope with the SvF dilemma from two different grains: intra-space (within the same feature space) and inter-space (between two different feature spaces). The proposed strategy designs a novel frequency-aware regularization to boost the intra-space SvF capability, and meanwhile develops a new feature space composition operation to enhance the inter-space SvF learning performance. With the multi-grained SvF learning strategy, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin."
2007.02394,Meta-Semi: A Meta-learning Approach for Semi-supervised Learning,"Deep learning based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have led to promising results in recent years. However, they tend to introduce multiple tunable hyper-parameters, making them less practical in real SSL scenarios where the labeled data is scarce for extensive hyper-parameter search. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning based SSL algorithm (Meta-Semi) that requires tuning only one additional hyper-parameter, compared with a standard supervised deep learning algorithm, to achieve competitive performance under various conditions of SSL. We start by defining a meta optimization problem that minimizes the loss on labeled data through dynamically reweighting the loss on unlabeled samples, which are associated with soft pseudo labels during training. As the meta problem is computationally intensive to solve directly, we propose an efficient algorithm to dynamically obtain the approximate solutions. We show theoretically that Meta-Semi converges to the stationary point of the loss function on labeled data under mild conditions. Empirically, Meta-Semi outperforms state-of-the-art SSL algorithms significantly on the challenging semi-supervised CIFAR-100 and STL-10 tasks, and achieves competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN."
2007.02713,Bifurcated backbone strategy for RGB-D salient object detection,"Multi-level feature fusion is a fundamental topic in computer vision. It has been exploited to detect, segment and classify objects at various scales. When multi-level features meet multi-modal cues, the optimal feature aggregation and multi-modal learning strategy become a hot potato. In this paper, we leverage the inherent multi-modal and multi-level nature of RGB-D salient object detection to devise a novel cascaded refinement network. In particular, first, we propose to regroup the multi-level features into teacher and student features using a bifurcated backbone strategy (BBS). Second, we introduce a depth-enhanced module (DEM) to excavate informative depth cues from the channel and spatial views. Then, RGB and depth modalities are fused in a complementary way. Our architecture, named Bifurcated Backbone Strategy Network (BBS-Net), is simple, efficient, and backbone-independent. Extensive experiments show that BBS-Net significantly outperforms eighteen SOTA models on eight challenging datasets under five evaluation measures, demonstrating the superiority of our approach ($\sim 4 \%$ improvement in S-measure $vs.$ the top-ranked model: DMRA-iccv2019). In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the generalization ability of different RGB-D datasets and provide a powerful training set for future research."
2007.03218,Classification with 2-D Convolutional Neural Networks for breast cancer   diagnosis,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Classification of cancer/non-cancer patients with clinical records requires high sensitivity and specificity for an acceptable diagnosis test. The state-of-the-art classification model - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), however, cannot be used with clinical data that are represented in 1-D format. CNN has been designed to work on a set of 2-D matrices whose elements show some correlation with neighboring elements such as in image data. Conversely, the data examples represented as a set of 1-D vectors -- apart from the time series data -- cannot be used with CNN, but with other classification models such as Artificial Neural Networks or RandomForest. We have proposed some novel preprocessing methods of data wrangling that transform a 1-D data vector, to a 2-D graphical image with appropriate correlations among the fields to be processed on CNN. We tested our methods on Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WBC) and Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) datasets. To our knowledge, this work is novel on non-image to image data transformation for the non-time series data. The transformed data processed with CNN using VGGnet-16 shows competitive results for the WBC dataset and outperforms other known methods for the WDBC dataset."
2007.03347,SpinalNet: Deep Neural Network with Gradual Input,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved the state of the art performance in numerous fields. However, DNNs need high computation times, and people always expect better performance in a lower computation. Therefore, we study the human somatosensory system and design a neural network (SpinalNet) to achieve higher accuracy with fewer computations. Hidden layers in traditional NNs receive inputs in the previous layer, apply activation function, and then transfer the outcomes to the next layer. In the proposed SpinalNet, each layer is split into three splits: 1) input split, 2) intermediate split, and 3) output split. Input split of each layer receives a part of the inputs. The intermediate split of each layer receives outputs of the intermediate split of the previous layer and outputs of the input split of the current layer. The number of incoming weights becomes significantly lower than traditional DNNs. The SpinalNet can also be used as the fully connected or classification layer of DNN and supports both traditional learning and transfer learning. We observe significant error reductions with lower computational costs in most of the DNNs. Traditional learning on the VGG-5 network with SpinalNet classification layers provided the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on QMNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, EMNIST (Letters, Digits, and Balanced) datasets. Traditional learning with ImageNet pre-trained initial weights and SpinalNet classification layers provided the SOTA performance on STL-10, Fruits 360, Bird225, and Caltech-101 datasets. The scripts of the proposed SpinalNet are available at the following link: https://github.com/dipuk0506/SpinalNet"
2007.03380,Re-thinking Co-Salient Object Detection,"In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the co-salient object detection (CoSOD) problem for images. CoSOD is an emerging and rapidly growing extension of salient object detection (SOD), which aims to detect the co-occurring salient objects in a group of images. However, existing CoSOD datasets often have a serious data bias, assuming that each group of images contains salient objects of similar visual appearances. This bias can lead to the ideal settings and effectiveness of models trained on existing datasets, being impaired in real-life situations, where similarities are usually semantic or conceptual. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a new benchmark, called CoSOD3k in the wild, which requires a large amount of semantic context, making it more challenging than existing CoSOD datasets. Our CoSOD3k consists of 3,316 high-quality, elaborately selected images divided into 160 groups with hierarchical annotations. The images span a wide range of categories, shapes, object sizes, and backgrounds. Second, we integrate the existing SOD techniques to build a unified, trainable CoSOD framework, which is long overdue in this field. Specifically, we propose a novel CoEG-Net that augments our prior model EGNet with a co-attention projection strategy to enable fast common information learning. CoEG-Net fully leverages previous large-scale SOD datasets and significantly improves the model scalability and stability. Third, we comprehensively summarize 40 cutting-edge algorithms, benchmarking 18 of them over three challenging CoSOD datasets (iCoSeg, CoSal2015, and our CoSOD3k), and reporting more detailed (i.e., group-level) performance analysis. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future works of CoSOD. We hope that our study will give a strong boost to growth in the CoSOD community. The benchmark toolbox and results are available on our project page at http://dpfan.net/CoSOD3K/."
2007.03408,A Generative Model for Texture Synthesis based on Optimal Transport   between Feature Distributions,"We propose GOTEX, a general framework for texture synthesis by optimization that constrains the statistical distribution of local features. While our model encompasses several existing texture models, we focus on the case where the comparison between feature distributions relies on optimal transport distances. We show that the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport allows to control the distribution of various possible features, even if these features live in a high-dimensional space. We then study the resulting minimax optimization problem, which corresponds to a Wasserstein generative model, for which the inner concave maximization problem can be solved with standard stochastic gradient methods. The alternate optimization algorithm is shown to be versatile in terms of applications, features and architecture; in particular it allows to produce high-quality synthesized textures with different sets of features. We analyze the results obtained by constraining the distribution of patches or the distribution of responses to a pre-learned VGG neural network. We show that the patch representation can retrieve the desired textural aspect in a more precise manner. We also provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods. The GOTEX model based on patch features is also adapted to texture inpainting and texture interpolation. Finally, we show how to use our framework to learn a feed-forward neural network that can synthesize on-the-fly new textures of arbitrary size in a very fast manner. Experimental results and comparisons with the mainstream methods from the literature illustrate the relevance of the generative models learned with GOTEX."
2007.06919,AQD: Towards Accurate Fully-Quantized Object Detection,"Network quantization allows inference to be conducted using low-precision arithmetic for improved inference efficiency of deep neural networks on edge devices. However, designing aggressively low-bit (e.g., 2-bit) quantization schemes on complex tasks, such as object detection, still remains challenging in terms of severe performance degradation and unverifiable efficiency on common hardware. In this paper, we propose an Accurate Quantized object Detection solution, termed AQD, to fully get rid of floating-point computation. To this end, we target using fixed-point operations in all kinds of layers, including the convolutional layers, normalization layers, and skip connections, allowing the inference to be executed using integer-only arithmetic. To demonstrate the improved latency-vs-accuracy trade-off, we apply the proposed methods on RetinaNet and FCOS. In particular, experimental results on MS-COCO dataset show that our AQD achieves comparable or even better performance compared with the full-precision counterpart under extremely low-bit schemes, which is of great practical value.

2007.07268,Explore and Explain: Self-supervised Navigation and Recounting,"Embodied AI has been recently gaining attention as it aims to foster the development of autonomous and intelligent agents. In this paper, we devise a novel embodied setting in which an agent needs to explore a previously unknown environment while recounting what it sees during the path. In this context, the agent needs to navigate the environment driven by an exploration goal, select proper moments for description, and output natural language descriptions of relevant objects and scenes. Our model integrates a novel self-supervised exploration module with penalty, and a fully-attentive captioning model for explanation. Also, we investigate different policies for selecting proper moments for explanation, driven by information coming from both the environment and the navigation. Experiments are conducted on photorealistic environments from the Matterport3D dataset and investigate the navigation and explanation capabilities of the agent as well as the role of their interactions."
2007.07924,Tracking Passengers and Baggage Items Using Multiple Overhead Cameras at   Security Checkpoints,"We introduce a novel framework to track multiple objects in overhead camera videos for airport checkpoint security scenarios where targets correspond to passengers and their baggage items. We propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically transformed images as inputs to a convolutional neural network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multiview trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to 42% without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multicamera association method achieves up to 89% multiobject tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than 15 ms."
2007.08566,SqueezeFacePoseNet: Lightweight Face Verification Across Different Poses   for Mobile Platforms,"Virtual applications through mobile platforms are one of the most critical and ever-growing fields in AI, where ubiquitous and real-time person authentication has become critical after the breakthrough of all services provided via mobile devices. In this context, face verification technologies can provide reliable and robust user authentication, given the availability of cameras in these devices, as well as their widespread use in everyday applications. The rapid development of deep Convolutional Neural Networks has resulted in many accurate face verification architectures. However, their typical size (hundreds of megabytes) makes them infeasible to be incorporated in downloadable mobile applications where the entire file typically may not exceed 100 Mb. Accordingly, we address the challenge of developing a lightweight face recognition network of just a few megabytes that can operate with sufficient accuracy in comparison to much larger models. The network also should be able to operate under different poses, given the variability naturally observed in uncontrolled environments where mobile devices are typically used. In this paper, we adapt the lightweight SqueezeNet model, of just 4.4MB, to effectively provide cross-pose face recognition. After trained on the MS-Celeb-1M and VGGFace2 databases, our model achieves an EER of 1.23% on the difficult frontal vs. profile comparison, and0.54% on profile vs. profile images. Under less extreme variations involving frontal images in any of the enrolment/query images pair, EER is pushed down to<0.3%, and the FRR at FAR=0.1%to less than 1%. This makes our light model suitable for face recognition where at least acquisition of the enrolment image can be controlled. At the cost of a slight degradation in performance, we also test an even lighter model (of just 2.5MB) where regular convolutions are replaced with depth-wise separable convolutions."
2007.10453,Points2Surf: Learning Implicit Surfaces from Point Cloud Patches,"A key step in any scanning-based asset creation workflow is to convert unordered point clouds to a surface. Classical methods (e.g., Poisson reconstruction) start to degrade in the presence of noisy and partial scans. Hence, deep learning based methods have recently been proposed to produce complete surfaces, even from partial scans. However, such data-driven methods struggle to generalize to new shapes with large geometric and topological variations. We present Points2Surf, a novel patch-based learning framework that produces accurate surfaces directly from raw scans without normals. Learning a prior over a combination of detailed local patches and coarse global information improves generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy. Our extensive comparison on both synthetic and real data demonstrates a clear advantage of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives on previously unseen classes (on average, Points2Surf brings down reconstruction error by 30% over SPR and by 270%+ over deep learning based SotA methods) at the cost of longer computation times and a slight increase in small-scale topological noise in some cases. Our source code, pre-trained model, and dataset are available on: https://github.com/ErlerPhilipp/points2surf"
2007.10689,A Deep Ordinal Distortion Estimation Approach for Distortion   Rectification,"Distortion is widely existed in the images captured by popular wide-angle cameras and fisheye cameras. Despite the long history of distortion rectification, accurately estimating the distortion parameters from a single distorted image is still challenging. The main reason is these parameters are implicit to image features, influencing the networks to fully learn the distortion information. In this work, we propose a novel distortion rectification approach that can obtain more accurate parameters with higher efficiency. Our key insight is that distortion rectification can be cast as a problem of learning an ordinal distortion from a single distorted image. To solve this problem, we design a local-global associated estimation network that learns the ordinal distortion to approximate the realistic distortion distribution. In contrast to the implicit distortion parameters, the proposed ordinal distortion have more explicit relationship with image features, and thus significantly boosts the distortion perception of neural networks. Considering the redundancy of distortion information, our approach only uses a part of distorted image for the ordinal distortion estimation, showing promising applications in the efficient distortion rectification. To our knowledge, we first unify the heterogeneous distortion parameters into a learning-friendly intermediate representation through ordinal distortion, bridging the gap between image feature and distortion rectification. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, with approximately 23% improvement on the quantitative evaluation while displaying the best performance on visual appearance. The code is available at https://github.com/KangLiao929/OrdinalDistortion."
2007.12104,Leveraging Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Few-Shot Object   Detection,"Few-shot object detection aims at detecting objects with few annotated examples, which remains a challenging research problem yet to be explored. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of self-learned top-down attention mechanisms in object detection and other vision tasks. The top-down attention, however, is less effective at improving the performance of few-shot detectors. Due to the insufficient training data, object detectors cannot effectively generate attention maps for few-shot examples. To improve the performance and interpretability of few-shot object detectors, we propose an attentive few-shot object detection network (AttFDNet) that takes the advantages of both top-down and bottom-up attention. Being task-agnostic, the bottom-up attention serves as a prior that helps detect and localize naturally salient objects. We further address specific challenges in few-shot object detection by introducing two novel loss terms and a hybrid few-shot learning strategy. Experimental results and visualization demonstrate the complementary nature of the two types of attention and their roles in few-shot object detection. Codes are available at https://github.com/chenxy99/AttFDNet."
2007.13072,"Approaches of large-scale images recognition with more than 50,000   categoris","Though current CV models have been able to achieve high levels of accuracy on small-scale images classification dataset with hundreds or thousands of categories, many models become infeasible in computational or space consumption when it comes to large-scale dataset with more than 50,000 categories. In this paper, we provide a viable solution for classifying large-scale species datasets using traditional CV techniques such as.features extraction and processing, BOVW(Bag of Visual Words) and some statistical learning technics like Mini-Batch K-Means,SVM which are used in our works. And then mixed with a neural network model. When applying these techniques, we have done some optimization in time and memory consumption, so that it can be feasible for large-scale dataset. And we also use some technics to reduce the impact of mislabeling data. We use a dataset with more than 50, 000 categories, and all operations are done on common computer with l 6GB RAM and a CPU of 3. OGHz. Our contributions are: 1) analysis what problems may meet in the training processes, and presents several feasible ways to solve these problems. 2) Make traditional CV models combined with neural network models provide some feasible scenarios for training large-scale classified datasets within the constraints of time and spatial resources."
2007.13640,Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using the Prior Implicit in a Denoiser,"Prior probability models are a fundamental component of many image processing problems, but density estimation is notoriously difficult for high-dimensional signals such as photographic images. Deep neural networks have provided state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing."
2008.01503,Multiple Code Hashing for Efficient Image Retrieval,"Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed, hashing has been widely used in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Hash bucket search returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query, which can enable search at a constant or sub-linear time cost. However, existing hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex scenarios, since they learn only one hash code for each image. More specifically, by using one hash code to represent one image, existing methods might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a result, a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving similar images, based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing framework, called multiple code hashing (MCH), to improve the performance of hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for each image, with each code representing a different region of the image. Furthermore, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that MCH can achieve a significant improvement in hash bucket search, compared with existing methods that learn only one hash code for each image."
2008.01701,Progressive Update Guided Interdependent Networks for Single Image   Dehazing,"Images with haze of different varieties often pose a significant challenge to dehazing. Therefore, guidance by estimates of haze parameters related to the variety would be beneficial, and their progressive update jointly with haze reduction will allow effective dehazing. To this end, we propose a multi-network dehazing framework containing novel interdependent dehazing and haze parameter updater networks that operate in a progressive manner. The haze parameters, transmission map and atmospheric light, are first estimated using dedicated convolutional networks that allow color-cast handling. The estimated parameters are then used to guide our dehazing module, where the estimates are progressively updated by novel convolutional networks. The updating takes place jointly with progressive dehazing using a network that invokes inter-step dependencies. The joint progressive updating and dehazing gradually modify the haze parameter values toward achieving effective dehazing. Through different studies, our dehazing framework is shown to be more effective than image-to-image mapping and predefined haze formation model based dehazing. The framework is also found capable of handling a wide variety of hazy conditions wtih different types and amounts of haze and color casts. Our dehazing framework is qualitatively and quantitatively found to outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic and real-world hazy images of multiple datasets with varied haze conditions."
2008.04615,Left Ventricular Wall Motion Estimation by Active Polynomials for Acute   Myocardial Infarction Detection,"Echocardiogram (echo) is the earliest and the primary tool for identifying regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) in order to diagnose myocardial infarction (MI) or commonly known as heart attack. This paper proposes a novel approach, Active Polynomials, which can accurately and robustly estimate the global motion of the Left Ventricular (LV) wall from any echo in a robust and accurate way. The proposed algorithm quantifies the true wall motion occurring in LV wall segments so as to assist cardiologists diagnose early signs of an acute MI. It further enables medical experts to gain an enhanced visualization capability of echo images through color-coded segments along with their ""maximum motion displacement"" plots helping them to better assess wall motion and LV Ejection-Fraction (LVEF). The outputs of the method can further help echo-technicians to assess and improve the quality of the echocardiogram recording. A major contribution of this study is the first public echo database collection composed by physicians at the Hamad Medical Corporation Hospital in Qatar. The so-called HMC-QU database will serve as the benchmark for the forthcoming relevant studies. The results over the HMC-QU dataset show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy, sensitivity and precision in MI detection even though the echo quality is quite poor, and the temporal resolution is low."
2008.06255,From Attack to Protection: Leveraging Watermarking Attack Network for   Advanced Add-on Watermarking,"Multi-bit watermarking (MW) has been designed to enhance resistance against watermarking attacks, such as signal processing operations and geometric distortions. Various benchmark tools exist to assess this robustness through simulated attacks on watermarked images. However, these tools often fail to capitalize on the unique attributes of the targeted MW and typically neglect the aspect of visual quality, a critical factor in practical applications. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a watermarking attack network (WAN), a fully trainable watermarking benchmark tool designed to exploit vulnerabilities within MW systems and induce watermark bit inversions, significantly diminishing watermark extractability. The proposed WAN employs an architecture based on residual dense blocks, which is adept at both local and global feature learning, thereby maintaining high visual quality while obstructing the extraction of embedded information. Our empirical results demonstrate that the WAN effectively undermines various block-based MW systems while minimizing visual degradation caused by attacks. This is facilitated by our novel watermarking attack loss, which is specifically crafted to compromise these systems. The WAN functions not only as a benchmarking tool but also as an add-on watermarking (AoW) mechanism, augmenting established universal watermarking schemes by enhancing robustness or imperceptibility without requiring detailed method context and adapting to dynamic watermarking requirements. Extensive experimental results show that AoW complements the performance of the targeted MW system by independently enhancing both imperceptibility and robustness."
2008.06392,Deep Domain Adaptation for Ordinal Regression of Pain Intensity   Estimation Using Weakly-Labelled Videos,"Estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions captured in videos has an immense potential for health care applications. Given the challenges related to subjective variations of facial expressions, and operational capture conditions, the accuracy of state-of-the-art DL models for recognizing facial expressions may decline. Domain adaptation has been widely explored to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occur between video data captured across various source and target domains. Moreover, given the laborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and subjective bias due to ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning is gaining attention in such applications. State-of-the-art WSL models are typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the ordinal relationship among pain intensity levels, nor temporal coherence of multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new DL model for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression that can be adapted using target domain videos with coarse labels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal relationships among intensity levels assigned to target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level labels. In particular, it learns discriminant and domain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple instance learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from target domain. The proposed approach was validated using RECOLA video dataset as fully-labeled source domain data, and UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain video dataset as weakly-labeled target domain data. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue datasets for sequence level estimation."
2008.07588,Uncertainty Quantification using Variational Inference for Biomedical   Image Segmentation,"Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not only do we need the predictions made by the model but also how confident it is while making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications for the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture based on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images. We evaluate our work on the publicly available BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model is able to segment brain tumours while taking into account both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in a principled bayesian manner."
2008.08251,Spatio-temporal relationships between rainfall and convective clouds   during Indian Monsoon through a discrete lens,"The Indian monsoon, a multi-variable process causing heavy rains during June-September every year, is very heterogeneous in space and time. We study the relationship between rainfall and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR, convective cloud cover) for monsoon between 2004-2010. To identify, classify and visualize spatial patterns of rainfall and OLR we use a discrete and spatio-temporally coherent representation of the data, created using a statistical model based on Markov Random Field. Our approach clusters the days with similar spatial distributions of rainfall and OLR into a small number of spatial patterns. We find that eight daily spatial patterns each in rainfall and OLR, and seven joint patterns of rainfall and OLR, describe over 90\% of all days. Through these patterns, we find that OLR generally has a strong negative correlation with precipitation, but with significant spatial variations. In particular, peninsular India (except west coast) is under significant convective cloud cover over a majority of days but remains rainless. We also find that much of the monsoon rainfall co-occurs with low OLR, but some amount of rainfall in Eastern and North-western India in June occurs on OLR days, presumably from shallow clouds. To study day-to-day variations of both quantities, we identify spatial patterns in the temporal gradients computed from the observations. We find that changes in convective cloud activity across India most commonly occur due to the establishment of a north-south OLR gradient which persists for 1-2 days and shifts the convective cloud cover from light to deep or vice versa. Such changes are also accompanied by changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation. The present work thus provides a highly reduced description of the complex spatial patterns and their day-to-day variations, and could form a useful tool for future simplified descriptions of this process."
2008.10271,Semantic Labeling of Large-Area Geographic Regions Using Multi-View and   Multi-Date Satellite Images and Noisy OSM Training Labels,"We present a novel multi-view training framework and CNN architecture for combining information from multiple overlapping satellite images and noisy training labels derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically label buildings and roads across large geographic regions (100 km$^2$). Our approach to multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class IoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views independently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of our system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for learning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference with a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that the benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of the network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of the GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per scene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates comparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first training them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the predicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our IoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively which are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that are not completely automated."
2008.10774,Image Colorization: A Survey and Dataset,"Image colorization estimates RGB colors for grayscale images or video frames to improve their aesthetic and perceptual quality. Over the last decade, deep learning techniques for image colorization have significantly progressed, necessitating a systematic survey and benchmarking of these techniques. This article presents a comprehensive survey of recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based image colorization techniques, describing their fundamental block architectures, inputs, optimizers, loss functions, training protocols, training data, etc. It categorizes the existing colorization techniques into seven classes and discusses important factors governing their performance, such as benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. We highlight the limitations of existing datasets and introduce a new dataset specific to colorization. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of existing image colorization methods using both existing datasets and our proposed one. Finally, we discuss the limitations of existing methods and recommend possible solutions and future research directions for this rapidly evolving topic of deep image colorization. The dataset and codes for evaluation are publicly available at https://github.com/saeed-anwar/ColorSurvey."
2008.10796,Deep Variational Network Toward Blind Image Restoration,"Blind image restoration (IR) is a common yet challenging problem in computer vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts."
2008.11451,Determinantal Point Process as an alternative to NMS,"We present a determinantal point process (DPP) inspired alternative to non-maximum suppression (NMS) which has become an integral step in all state-of-the-art object detection frameworks. DPPs have been shown to encourage diversity in subset selection problems. We pose NMS as a subset selection problem and posit that directly incorporating DPP like framework can improve the overall performance of the object detection system. We propose an optimization problem which takes the same inputs as NMS, but introduces a novel sub-modularity based diverse subset selection functional. Our results strongly indicate that the modifications proposed in this paper can provide consistent improvements to state-of-the-art object detection pipelines."
2008.11945,"Moderately Supervised Learning: Definition, Framework and Generality","Learning with supervision has achieved remarkable success in numerous artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In the current literature, by referring to the properties of the labels prepared for the training dataset, learning with supervision is categorized as supervised learning (SL) and weakly supervised learning (WSL). SL concerns the situation where the training data set is assigned with ideal (complete, exact and accurate) labels, while WSL concerns the situation where the training data set is assigned with non-ideal (incomplete, inexact or inaccurate) labels. However, various solutions for SL tasks have shown that the given labels are not always easy to learn, and the transformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn targets can significantly affect the performance of the final SL solutions. Without considering the properties of the transformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn targets, the definition of SL conceals some details that can be critical to building the appropriate solutions for specific SL tasks. Thus, for engineers in the AI application field, it is desirable to reveal these details systematically. This article attempts to achieve this goal by expanding the categorization of SL and investigating the sub-type moderately supervised learning (MSL) that concerns the situation where the given labels are ideal, but due to the simplicity in annotation, careful designs are required to transform the given labels into easy-to-learn targets. From the perspectives of the definition, framework and generality, we conceptualize MSL to present a complete fundamental basis to systematically analyse MSL tasks. At meantime, revealing the relation between the conceptualization of MSL and the mathematicians' vision, this paper as well establishes a tutorial for AI application engineers to refer to viewing a problem to be solved from the mathematicians' vision."
2008.12065,Propensity-to-Pay: Machine Learning for Estimating Prediction Uncertainty,"Predicting a customer's propensity-to-pay at an early point in the revenue cycle can provide organisations many opportunities to improve the customer experience, reduce hardship and reduce the risk of impaired cash flow and occurrence of bad debt. With the advancements in data science; machine learning techniques can be used to build models to accurately predict a customer's propensity-to-pay. Creating effective machine learning models without access to large and detailed datasets presents some significant challenges. This paper presents a case-study, conducted on a dataset from an energy organisation, to explore the uncertainty around the creation of machine learning models that are able to predict residential customers entering financial hardship which then reduces their ability to pay energy bills. Incorrect predictions can result in inefficient resource allocation and vulnerable customers not being proactively identified. This study investigates machine learning models' ability to consider different contexts and estimate the uncertainty in the prediction. Seven models from four families of machine learning algorithms are investigated for their novel utilisation. A novel concept of utilising a Baysian Neural Network to the binary classification problem of propensity-to-pay energy bills is proposed and explored for deployment."
2008.12505,Nonlocal Adaptive Direction-Guided Structure Tensor Total Variation For   Image Recovery,"A common strategy in variational image recovery is utilizing the nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) property, when designing energy functionals. One such contribution is nonlocal structure tensor total variation (NLSTV), which lies at the core of this study. This paper is concerned with boosting the NLSTV regularization term through the use of directional priors. More specifically, NLSTV is leveraged so that, at each image point, it gains more sensitivity in the direction that is presumed to have the minimum local variation. The actual difficulty here is capturing this directional information from the corrupted image. In this regard, we propose a method that employs anisotropic Gaussian kernels to estimate directional features to be later used by our proposed model. The experiments validate that our entire two-stage framework achieves better results than the NLSTV model and two other competing local models, in terms of visual and quantitative evaluation."
2008.13227,A Compact Deep Architecture for Real-time Saliency Prediction,"Saliency computation models aim to imitate the attention mechanism in the human visual system. The application of deep neural networks for saliency prediction has led to a drastic improvement over the last few years. However, deep models have a high number of parameters which makes them less suitable for real-time applications. Here we propose a compact yet fast model for real-time saliency prediction. Our proposed model consists of a modified U-net architecture, a novel fully connected layer, and central difference convolutional layers. The modified U-Net architecture promotes compactness and efficiency. The novel fully-connected layer facilitates the implicit capturing of the location-dependent information. Using the central difference convolutional layers at different scales enables capturing more robust and biologically motivated features. We compare our model with state of the art saliency models using traditional saliency scores as well as our newly devised scheme. Experimental results over four challenging saliency benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in striking a balance between accuracy and speed. Our model can be run in real-time which makes it appealing for edge devices and video processing."
2009.00453,DropLeaf: a precision farming smartphone application for measuring   pesticide spraying methods,"Pesticide application has been heavily used in the cultivation of major crops, contributing to the increase of crop production over the past decades. However, their appropriate use and calibration of machines rely upon evaluation methodologies that can precisely estimate how well the pesticides' spraying covered the crops. A few strategies have been proposed in former works, yet their elevated costs and low portability do not permit their wide adoption. This work introduces and experimentally assesses a novel tool that functions over a smartphone-based mobile application, named DropLeaf - Spraying Meter. Tests performed using DropLeaf demonstrated that, notwithstanding its versatility, it can estimate the pesticide spraying with high precision. Our methodology is based on image analysis, and the assessment of spraying deposition measures is performed successfully over real and synthetic water-sensitive papers. The proposed tool can be extensively used by farmers and agronomists furnished with regular smartphones, improving the utilization of pesticides with well-being, ecological, and monetary advantages. DropLeaf can be easily used for spray drift assessment of different methods, including emerging UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) sprayers."
2009.02191,Dual Precision Deep Neural Network,"On-line Precision scalability of the deep neural networks(DNNs) is a critical feature to support accuracy and complexity trade-off during the DNN inference. In this paper, we propose dual-precision DNN that includes two different precision modes in a single model, thereby supporting an on-line precision switch without re-training. The proposed two-phase training process optimizes both low- and high-precision modes."

In order to handle extremely large objects in 3D-FUTURE, we adopt PointRend as our basic framework, which outputs more fine-grained masks compared to HTC and SOLOv2.

2009.04776,Self-supervised Depth Denoising Using Lower- and Higher-quality RGB-D   sensors,"Consumer-level depth cameras and depth sensors embedded in mobile devices enable numerous applications, such as AR games and face identification. However, the quality of the captured depth is sometimes insufficient for 3D reconstruction, tracking and other computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised depth denoising approach to denoise and refine depth coming from a low quality sensor. We record simultaneous RGB-D sequences with unzynchronized lower- and higher-quality cameras and solve a challenging problem of aligning sequences both temporally and spatially. We then learn a deep neural network to denoise the lower-quality depth using the matched higher-quality data as a source of supervision signal. We experimentally validate our method against state-of-the-art filtering-based and deep denoising techniques and show its application for 3D object reconstruction tasks where our approach leads to more detailed fused surfaces and better tracking."
2009.05107,Generating Image Adversarial Examples by Embedding Digital Watermarks,"With the increasing attention to deep neural network (DNN) models, attacks are also upcoming for such models. For example, an attacker may carefully construct images in specific ways (also referred to as adversarial examples) aiming to mislead the DNN models to output incorrect classification results. Similarly, many efforts are proposed to detect and mitigate adversarial examples, usually for certain dedicated attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermark-based method to generate image adversarial examples to fool DNN models. Specifically, partial main features of the watermark image are embedded into the host image almost invisibly, aiming to tamper with and damage the recognition capabilities of the DNN models. We devise an efficient mechanism to select host images and watermark images and utilize the improved discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm with a set of valid hyperparameters to embed digital watermarks from the watermark image dataset into original images for generating image adversarial examples. The experimental results illustrate that the attack success rate on common DNN models can reach an average of 95.47% on the CIFAR-10 dataset and the highest at 98.71%. Besides, our scheme is able to generate a large number of adversarial examples efficiently, concretely, an average of 1.17 seconds for completing the attacks on each image on the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition, we design a baseline experiment using the watermark images generated by Gaussian noise as the watermark image dataset that also displays the effectiveness of our scheme. Similarly, we also propose the modified discrete cosine transform (DCT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm. To ensure repeatability and reproducibility, the source code is available on GitHub."
2009.08395,A Multimodal Memes Classification: A Survey and Open Research Issues,"Memes are graphics and text overlapped so that together they present concepts that become dubious if one of them is absent. It is spread mostly on social media platforms, in the form of jokes, sarcasm, motivating, etc. After the success of BERT in Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers inclined to Visual-Linguistic (VL) multimodal problems like memes classification, image captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), and many more. Unfortunately, many memes get uploaded each day on social media platforms that need automatic censoring to curb misinformation and hate. Recently, this issue has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. State-of-the-art methods that performed significantly on other VL dataset, tends to fail on memes classification. In this context, this work aims to conduct a comprehensive study on memes classification, generally on the VL multimodal problems and cutting edge solutions. We propose a generalized framework for VL problems. We cover the early and next-generation works on VL problems. Finally, we identify and articulate several open research issues and challenges. This is the first study that presents the generalized view of the advanced classification techniques concerning memes classification to the best of our knowledge. We believe this study presents a clear road-map for the Machine Learning (ML) research community to implement and enhance memes classification techniques."
2009.08618,6-DoF Grasp Planning using Fast 3D Reconstruction and Grasp Quality CNN,"Recent consumer demand for home robots has accelerated performance of robotic grasping. However, a key component of the perception pipeline, the depth camera, is still expensive and inaccessible to most consumers. In addition, grasp planning has significantly improved recently, by leveraging large datasets and cloud robotics, and by limiting the state and action space to top-down grasps with 4 degrees of freedom (DoF). By leveraging multi-view geometry of the object using inexpensive equipment such as off-the-shelf RGB cameras and state-of-the-art algorithms such as Learn Stereo Machine (LSM\cite{kar2017learning}), the robot is able to generate more robust grasps from different angles with 6-DoF. In this paper, we present a modification of LSM to graspable objects, evaluate the grasps, and develop a 6-DoF grasp planner based on Grasp-Quality CNN (GQ-CNN\cite{mahler2017dex}) that exploits multiple camera views to plan a robust grasp, even in the absence of a possible top-down grasp."
2009.09213,Dodging DeepFake Detection via Implicit Spatial-Domain Notch Filtering,"The current high-fidelity generation and high-precision detection of DeepFake images are at an arms race. We believe that producing DeepFakes that are highly realistic and 'detection evasive' can serve the ultimate goal of improving future generation DeepFake detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images without hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch filtering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, although famously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatial domain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs required for the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to reproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We adopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the periodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free fake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a specialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images with high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts. Moreover, we also use the semantic information of the image to generate an adversarial guidance map to add noise intelligently. Our large-scale evaluation on 3 representative state-of-the-art DeepFake detection methods (tested on 16 types of DeepFakes) has demonstrated that our technique significantly reduces the accuracy of these 3 fake image detection methods, 36.79% on average and up to 97.02% in the best case."
2009.09231,Adversarial Exposure Attack on Diabetic Retinopathy Imagery Grading,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss around the world. To help diagnose it, numerous cutting-edge works have built powerful deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically grade DR via retinal fundus images (RFIs). However, RFIs are commonly affected by camera exposure issues that may lead to incorrect grades. The mis-graded results can potentially pose high risks to an aggravation of the condition. In this paper, we study this problem from the viewpoint of adversarial attacks. We identify and introduce a novel solution to an entirely new task, termed as adversarial exposure attack, which is able to produce natural exposure images and mislead the state-of-the-art DNNs. We validate our proposed method on a real-world public DR dataset with three DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, demonstrating that our method achieves high image quality and success rate in transferring the attacks. Our method reveals the potential threats to DNN-based automatic DR grading and would benefit the development of exposure-robust DR grading methods in the future."
2009.09566,SSCR: Iterative Language-Based Image Editing via Self-Supervised   Counterfactual Reasoning,"Iterative Language-Based Image Editing (IL-BIE) tasks follow iterative instructions to edit images step by step. Data scarcity is a significant issue for ILBIE as it is challenging to collect large-scale examples of images before and after instruction-based changes. However, humans still accomplish these editing tasks even when presented with an unfamiliar image-instruction pair. Such ability results from counterfactual thinking and the ability to think about alternatives to events that have happened already. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Supervised Counterfactual Reasoning (SSCR) framework that incorporates counterfactual thinking to overcome data scarcity. SSCR allows the model to consider out-of-distribution instructions paired with previous images. With the help of cross-task consistency (CTC), we train these counterfactual instructions in a self-supervised scenario. Extensive results show that SSCR improves the correctness of ILBIE in terms of both object identity and position, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA) on two IBLIE datasets (i-CLEVR and CoDraw). Even with only 50% of the training data, SSCR achieves a comparable result to using complete data."
2009.12698,COVID-19 Infection Map Generation and Detection from Chest X-Ray Images,"Computer-aided diagnosis has become a necessity for accurate and immediate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection to aid treatment and prevent the spread of the virus. Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, they have used very limited chest X-ray (CXR) image repositories for evaluation with a small number, a few hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize nor grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies proposed to explore the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain inaccurate for localizing the actual infestation making them unreliable for clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the joint localization, severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating the so-called infection maps. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest dataset with 119,316 CXR images including 2951 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel collaborative human-machine approach. Furthermore, we publicly release the first CXR dataset with the ground-truth segmentation masks of the COVID-19 infected regions. A detailed set of experiments show that state-of-the-art segmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19 infection with an F1-score of 83.20%, which is significantly superior to the activation maps created by the previous methods. Finally, the proposed approach achieved a COVID-19 detection performance with 94.96% sensitivity and 99.88% specificity."
2010.03420,Deep Neural Network: An Efficient and Optimized Machine Learning   Paradigm for Reducing Genome Sequencing Error,"Genomic data I used in many fields but, it has become known that most of the platforms used in the sequencing process produce significant errors. This means that the analysis and inferences generated from these data may have some errors that need to be corrected. On the two main types of genome errors - substitution and indels - our work is focused on correcting indels. A deep learning approach was used to correct the errors in sequencing the chosen dataset"
2010.03523,BoMuDANet: Unsupervised Adaptation for Visual Scene Understanding in   Unstructured Driving Environments,"We present an unsupervised adaptation approach for visual scene understanding in unstructured traffic environments. Our method is designed for unstructured real-world scenarios with dense and heterogeneous traffic consisting of cars, trucks, two-and three-wheelers, and pedestrians. We describe a new semantic segmentation technique based on unsupervised domain adaptation (DA), that can identify the class or category of each region in RGB images or videos. We also present a novel self-training algorithm (Alt-Inc) for multi-source DA that improves the accuracy. Our overall approach is a deep learning-based technique and consists of an unsupervised neural network that achieves 87.18% accuracy on the challenging India Driving Dataset. Our method works well on roads that may not be well-marked or may include dirt, unidentifiable debris, potholes, etc. A key aspect of our approach is that it can also identify objects that are encountered by the model for the fist time during the testing phase. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art methods and show an improvement of 5.17% - 42.9%. Furthermore, we also conduct user studies that qualitatively validate the improvements in visual scene understanding of unstructured driving environments."
2010.05784,Learning Calibrated Uncertainties for Domain Shift: A Distributionally   Robust Learning Approach,"We propose a framework for learning calibrated uncertainties under domain shifts, where the source (training) distribution differs from the target (test) distribution. We detect such domain shifts via a differentiable density ratio estimator and train it together with the task network, composing an adjusted softmax predictive form concerning domain shift. In particular, the density ratio estimation reflects the closeness of a target (test) sample to the source (training) distribution. We employ it to adjust the uncertainty of prediction in the task network. This idea of using the density ratio is based on the distributionally robust learning (DRL) framework, which accounts for the domain shift by adversarial risk minimization. We show that our proposed method generates calibrated uncertainties that benefit downstream tasks, such as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). On these tasks, methods like self-training and FixMatch use uncertainties to select confident pseudo-labels for re-training. Our experiments show that the introduction of DRL leads to significant improvements in cross-domain performance. We also show that the estimated density ratios align with human selection frequencies, suggesting a positive correlation with a proxy of human perceived uncertainties."
2010.07769,Image Denoising Using the Geodesics' Gramian of the Manifold Underlying   Patch-Space,"With the proliferation of sophisticated cameras in modern society, the demand for accurate and visually pleasing images is increasing. However, the quality of an image captured by a camera may be degraded by noise. Thus, some processing of images is required to filter out the noise without losing vital image features. Even though the current literature offers a variety of denoising methods, the fidelity and efficacy of their denoising are sometimes uncertain. Thus, here we propose a novel and computationally efficient image denoising method that is capable of producing accurate images. To preserve image smoothness, this method inputs patches partitioned from the image rather than pixels. Then, it performs denoising on the manifold underlying the patch-space rather than that in the image domain to better preserve the features across the whole image. We validate the performance of this method against benchmark image processing methods."
2010.08755,Variational Dynamic for Self-Supervised Exploration in Deep   Reinforcement Learning,"Efficient exploration remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks where extrinsic rewards from environments are sparse or even totally disregarded. Significant advances based on intrinsic motivation show promising results in simple environments but often get stuck in environments with multimodal and stochastic dynamics. In this work, we propose a variational dynamic model based on the conditional variational inference to model the multimodality and stochasticity. We consider the environmental state-action transition as a conditional generative process by generating the next-state prediction under the condition of the current state, action, and latent variable, which provides a better understanding of the dynamics and leads a better performance in exploration. We derive an upper bound of the negative log-likelihood of the environmental transition and use such an upper bound as the intrinsic reward for exploration, which allows the agent to learn skills by self-supervised exploration without observing extrinsic rewards. We evaluate the proposed method on several image-based simulation tasks and a real robotic manipulating task. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art environment model-based exploration approaches."
2010.09278,MimicNorm: Weight Mean and Last BN Layer Mimic the Dynamic of Batch   Normalization,"Substantial experiments have validated the success of Batch Normalization (BN) Layer in benefiting convergence and generalization. However, BN requires extra memory and float-point calculation. Moreover, BN would be inaccurate on micro-batch, as it depends on batch statistics. In this paper, we address these problems by simplifying BN regularization while keeping two fundamental impacts of BN layers, i.e., data decorrelation and adaptive learning rate. We propose a novel normalization method, named MimicNorm, to improve the convergence and efficiency in network training. MimicNorm consists of only two light operations, including modified weight mean operations (subtract mean values from weight parameter tensor) and one BN layer before loss function (last BN layer). We leverage the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory to prove that our weight mean operation whitens activations and transits network into the chaotic regime like BN layer, and consequently, leads to an enhanced convergence. The last BN layer provides autotuned learning rates and also improves accuracy. Experimental results show that MimicNorm achieves similar accuracy for various network structures, including ResNets and lightweight networks like ShuffleNet, with a reduction of about 20% memory consumption. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Kid-key/MimicNorm."
2010.12190,Towards Robust Neural Networks via Orthogonal Diversity,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to invisible perturbations on the images generated by adversarial attacks, which raises researches on the adversarial robustness of DNNs. A series of methods represented by the adversarial training and its variants have proven as one of the most effective techniques in enhancing the DNN robustness. Generally, adversarial training focuses on enriching the training data by involving perturbed data. Such data augmentation effect of the involved perturbed data in adversarial training does not contribute to the robustness of DNN itself and usually suffers from clean accuracy drop. Towards the robustness of DNN itself, we in this paper propose a novel defense that aims at augmenting the model in order to learn features that are adaptive to diverse inputs, including adversarial examples. More specifically, to augment the model, multiple paths are embedded into the network, and an orthogonality constraint is imposed on these paths to guarantee the diversity among them. A margin-maximization loss is then designed to further boost such DIversity via Orthogonality (DIO). In this way, the proposed DIO augments the model and enhances the robustness of DNN itself as the learned features can be corrected by these mutually-orthogonal paths. Extensive empirical results on various data sets, structures and attacks verify the stronger adversarial robustness of the proposed DIO utilizing model augmentation. Besides, DIO can also be flexibly combined with different data augmentation techniques (e.g., TRADES and DDPM), further promoting robustness gains."
2010.12391,Segmentation of the cortical plate in fetal brain MRI with a topological   loss,"The fetal cortical plate undergoes drastic morphological changes throughout early in utero development that can be observed using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. An accurate MR image segmentation, and more importantly a topologically correct delineation of the cortical gray matter, is a key baseline to perform further quantitative analysis of brain development. In this paper, we propose for the first time the integration of a topological constraint, as an additional loss function, to enhance the morphological consistency of a deep learning-based segmentation of the fetal cortical plate. We quantitatively evaluate our method on 18 fetal brain atlases ranging from 21 to 38 weeks of gestation, showing the significant benefits of our method through all gestational ages as compared to a baseline method. Furthermore, qualitative evaluation by three different experts on 130 randomly selected slices from 26 clinical MRIs evidences the out-performance of our method independently of the MR reconstruction quality."
2010.12669,Position and Rotation Invariant Sign Language Recognition from 3D Kinect   Data with Recurrent Neural Networks,"Sign language is a gesture-based symbolic communication medium among speech and hearing impaired people. It also serves as a communication bridge between non-impaired and impaired populations. Unfortunately, in most situations, a non-impaired person is not well conversant in such symbolic languages restricting the natural information flow between these two categories. Therefore, an automated translation mechanism that seamlessly translates sign language into natural language can be highly advantageous. In this paper, we attempt to perform recognition of 30 basic Indian sign gestures. Gestures are represented as temporal sequences of 3D maps (RGB + depth), each consisting of 3D coordinates of 20 body joints captured by the Kinect sensor. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. To improve the classifier's performance, we use geometric transformation for the alignment correction of depth frames. In our experiments, the model achieves 84.81% accuracy."
2010.12967,Automated triage of COVID-19 from various lung abnormalities using chest   CT features,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has lead to a global effort to decelerate the pandemic spread. For this purpose chest computed-tomography (CT) based screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected patients is utilized, either as a support or replacement to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. In this paper, we propose a fully automated AI based system that takes as input chest CT scans and triages COVID-19 cases. More specifically, we produce multiple descriptive features, including lung and infections statistics, texture, shape and location, to train a machine learning based classifier that distinguishes between COVID-19 and other lung abnormalities (including community acquired pneumonia). We evaluated our system on a dataset of 2191 CT cases and demonstrated a robust solution with 90.8% sensitivity at 85.4% specificity with 94.0% ROC-AUC. In addition, we present an elaborated feature analysis and ablation study to explore the importance of each feature."
2010.12970,Deep Denoising For Scientific Discovery: A Case Study In Electron   Microscopy,"Denoising is a fundamental challenge in scientific imaging. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide the current state of the art in denoising natural images, where they produce impressive results. However, their potential has barely been explored in the context of scientific imaging. Denoising CNNs are typically trained on real natural images artificially corrupted with simulated noise. In contrast, in scientific applications, noiseless ground-truth images are usually not available. To address this issue, we propose a simulation-based denoising (SBD) framework, in which CNNs are trained on simulated images. We test the framework on data obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an imaging technique with widespread applications in material science, biology, and medicine. SBD outperforms existing techniques by a wide margin on a simulated benchmark dataset, as well as on real data. Apart from the denoised images, SBD generates likelihood maps to visualize the agreement between the structure of the denoised image and the observed data. Our results reveal shortcomings of state-of-the-art denoising architectures, such as their small field-of-view: substantially increasing the field-of-view of the CNNs allows them to exploit non-local periodic patterns in the data, which is crucial at high noise levels. In addition, we analyze the generalization capability of SBD, demonstrating that the trained networks are robust to variations of imaging parameters and of the underlying signal structure. Finally, we release the first publicly available benchmark dataset of TEM images, containing 18,000 examples."
2010.13187,Improving the Reconstruction of Disentangled Representation Learners via   Multi-Stage Modeling,"Current autoencoder-based disentangled representation learning methods achieve disentanglement by penalizing the (aggregate) posterior to encourage statistical independence of the latent factors. This approach introduces a trade-off between disentangled representation learning and reconstruction quality since the model does not have enough capacity to learn correlated latent variables that capture detail information present in most image data. To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel multi-stage modeling approach where the disentangled factors are first learned using a penalty-based disentangled representation learning method; then, the low-quality reconstruction is improved with another deep generative model that is trained to model the missing correlated latent variables, adding detail information while maintaining conditioning on the previously learned disentangled factors. Taken together, our multi-stage modelling approach results in a single, coherent probabilistic model that is theoretically justified by the principal of D-separation and can be realized with a variety of model classes including likelihood-based models such as variational autoencoders, implicit models such as generative adversarial networks, and tractable models like normalizing flows or mixtures of Gaussians. We demonstrate that our multi-stage model has higher reconstruction quality than current state-of-the-art methods with equivalent disentanglement performance across multiple standard benchmarks. In addition, we apply the multi-stage model to generate synthetic tabular datasets, showcasing an enhanced performance over benchmark models across a variety of metrics. The interpretability analysis further indicates that the multi-stage model can effectively uncover distinct and meaningful features of variations from which the original distribution can be recovered."
2010.14129,Mining Generalized Features for Detecting AI-Manipulated Fake Faces,"Recently, AI-manipulated face techniques have developed rapidly and constantly, which has raised new security issues in society. Although existing detection methods consider different categories of fake faces, the performance on detecting the fake faces with ""unseen"" manipulation techniques is still poor due to the distribution bias among cross-manipulation techniques. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework that focuses on mining intrinsic features and further eliminating the distribution bias to improve the generalization ability. Firstly, we focus on mining the intrinsic clues in the channel difference image (CDI) and spectrum image (SI) from the camera imaging process and the indispensable step in AI manipulation process. Then, we introduce the Octave Convolution (OctConv) and an attention-based fusion module to effectively and adaptively mine intrinsic features from CDI and SI. Finally, we design an alignment module to eliminate the bias of manipulation techniques to obtain a more generalized detection framework. We evaluate the proposed framework on four categories of fake faces datasets with the most popular and state-of-the-art manipulation techniques, and achieve very competitive performances. To further verify the generalization ability of the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on cross-manipulation techniques, and the results show the advantages of our method."
2010.15775,Understanding the Failure Modes of Out-of-Distribution Generalization,"Empirical studies suggest that machine learning models often rely on features, such as the background, that may be spuriously correlated with the label only during training time, resulting in poor accuracy during test-time. In this work, we identify the fundamental factors that give rise to this behavior, by explaining why models fail this way {\em even} in easy-to-learn tasks where one would expect these models to succeed. In particular, through a theoretical study of gradient-descent-trained linear classifiers on some easy-to-learn tasks, we uncover two complementary failure modes. These modes arise from how spurious correlations induce two kinds of skews in the data: one geometric in nature, and another, statistical in nature. Finally, we construct natural modifications of image classification datasets to understand when these failure modes can arise in practice. We also design experiments to isolate the two failure modes when training modern neural networks on these datasets."
2011.03043,Neuron-based explanations of neural networks sacrifice completeness and   interpretability,"High quality explanations of neural networks (NNs) should exhibit two key properties. Completeness ensures that they accurately reflect a network's function and interpretability makes them understandable to humans. Many existing methods provide explanations of individual neurons within a network. In this work we provide evidence that for AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet, neuron-based explanation methods sacrifice both completeness and interpretability compared to activation principal components. Neurons are a poor basis for AlexNet embeddings because they don't account for the distributed nature of these representations. By examining two quantitative measures of completeness and conducting a user study to measure interpretability, we show the most important principal components provide more complete and interpretable explanations than the most important neurons. Much of the activation variance may be explained by examining relatively few high-variance PCs, as opposed to studying every neuron. These principal components also strongly affect network function, and are significantly more interpretable than neurons. Our findings suggest that explanation methods for networks like AlexNet should avoid using neurons as a basis for embeddings and instead choose a basis, such as principal components, which accounts for the high dimensional and distributed nature of a network's internal representations. Interactive demo and code available at https://ndey96.github.io/neuron-explanations-sacrifice."
2011.04076,A Psychophysically Oriented Saliency Map Prediction Model,"Visual attention is one of the most significant characteristics for selecting and understanding the outside redundancy world. The human vision system cannot process all information simultaneously due to the visual information bottleneck. In order to reduce the redundant input of visual information, the human visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of scenes. This is commonly known as visual saliency map prediction. This paper proposed a new psychophysical saliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by multi-channel model of visual cortex functioning in humans. The model consists of opponent color channels, wavelet transform, wavelet energy map, and contrast sensitivity function for extracting low-level image features and providing a maximum approximation to the human visual system. The proposed model is evaluated using several datasets, including the MIT1003, MIT300, TORONTO, SID4VAM, and UCF Sports datasets. We also quantitatively and qualitatively compare the saliency prediction performance with that of other state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved strongly stable and better performance with different metrics on natural images, psychophysical synthetic images and dynamic videos. Additionally, we found that Fourier and spectral-inspired saliency prediction models outperformed other state-of-the-art non-neural network and even deep neural network models on psychophysical synthetic images. It can be explained and supported by the Fourier Vision Hypothesis. In the meantime, we suggest that deep neural networks need specific architectures and goals to be able to predict salient performance on psychophysical synthetic images better and more reliably. Finally, the proposed model could be used as a computational model of primate vision system and help us understand mechanism of primate vision system."
2011.04094,Image Clustering using an Augmented Generative Adversarial Network and   Information Maximization,"Image clustering has recently attracted significant attention due to the increased availability of unlabelled datasets. The efficiency of traditional clustering algorithms heavily depends on the distance functions used and the dimensionality of the features. Therefore, performance degradation is often observed when tackling either unprocessed images or high-dimensional features extracted from processed images. To deal with these challenges, we propose a deep clustering framework consisting of a modified generative adversarial network (GAN) and an auxiliary classifier. The modification employs Sobel operations prior to the discriminator of the GAN to enhance the separability of the learned features. The discriminator is then leveraged to generate representations as the input to an auxiliary classifier. An adaptive objective function is utilised to train the auxiliary classifier for clustering the representations, aiming to increase the robustness by minimizing the divergence of multiple representations generated by the discriminator. The auxiliary classifier is implemented with a group of multiple cluster-heads, where a tolerance hyper-parameter is used to tackle imbalanced data. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and is competitive on the STL10 and MNIST datasets."
2011.04197,Detecting Outliers with Foreign Patch Interpolation,"In medical imaging, outliers can contain hypo/hyper-intensities, minor deformations, or completely altered anatomy. To detect these irregularities it is helpful to learn the features present in both normal and abnormal images. However this is difficult because of the wide range of possible abnormalities and also the number of ways that normal anatomy can vary naturally. As such, we leverage the natural variations in normal anatomy to create a range of synthetic abnormalities. Specifically, the same patch region is extracted from two independent samples and replaced with an interpolation between both patches. The interpolation factor, patch size, and patch location are randomly sampled from uniform distributions. A wide residual encoder decoder is trained to give a pixel-wise prediction of the patch and its interpolation factor. This encourages the network to learn what features to expect normally and to identify where foreign patterns have been introduced. The estimate of the interpolation factor lends itself nicely to the derivation of an outlier score. Meanwhile the pixel-wise output allows for pixel- and subject- level predictions using the same model."
2011.05243,Classification of Polarimetric SAR Images Using Compact Convolutional   Neural Networks,"Classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is an active research area with a major role in environmental applications. The traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods proposed in this domain generally focus on utilizing highly discriminative features to improve the classification performance, but this task is complicated by the well-known ""curse of dimensionality"" phenomena. Other approaches based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have certain limitations and drawbacks, such as high computational complexity, an unfeasibly large training set with ground-truth labels, and special hardware requirements. In this work, to address the limitations of traditional ML and deep CNN based methods, a novel and systematic classification framework is proposed for the classification of PolSAR images, based on a compact and adaptive implementation of CNNs using a sliding-window classification approach. The proposed approach has three advantages. First, there is no requirement for an extensive feature extraction process. Second, it is computationally efficient due to utilized compact configurations. In particular, the proposed compact and adaptive CNN model is designed to achieve the maximum classification accuracy with minimum training and computational complexity. This is of considerable importance considering the high costs involved in labelling in PolSAR classification. Finally, the proposed approach can perform classification using smaller window sizes than deep CNNs. Experimental evaluations have been performed over the most commonly-used four benchmark PolSAR images: AIRSAR L-Band and RADARSAT-2 C-Band data of San Francisco Bay and Flevoland areas. Accordingly, the best obtained overall accuracies range between 92.33 - 99.39% for these benchmark study sites."
2011.08388,Interpretable Image Emotion Recognition: A Domain Adaptation Approach   Using Facial Expressions,"This paper proposes a feature-based domain adaptation technique for identifying emotions in generic images, encompassing both facial and non-facial objects, as well as non-human components. This approach addresses the challenge of the limited availability of pre-trained models and well-annotated datasets for Image Emotion Recognition (IER). Initially, a deep-learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system is developed, classifying facial images into discrete emotion classes. Maintaining the same network architecture, this FER system is then adapted to recognize emotions in generic images through the application of discrepancy loss, enabling the model to effectively learn IER features while classifying emotions into categories such as 'happy,' 'sad,' 'hate,' and 'anger.' Additionally, a novel interpretability method, Divide and Conquer based Shap (DnCShap), is introduced to elucidate the visual features most relevant for emotion recognition. The proposed IER system demonstrated emotion classification accuracies of 61.86% for the IAPSa dataset, 62.47 for the ArtPhoto dataset, 70.78% for the FI dataset, and 59.72% for the EMOTIC dataset. The system effectively identifies the important visual features that lead to specific emotion classifications and also provides detailed embedding plots explaining the predictions, enhancing the understanding and trust in AI-driven emotion recognition systems."
2011.08790,P1AC: Revisiting Absolute Pose From a Single Affine Correspondence,"Affine correspondences have traditionally been used to improve feature matching over wide baselines. While recent work has successfully used affine correspondences to solve various relative camera pose estimation problems, less attention has been given to their use in absolute pose estimation. We introduce the first general solution to the problem of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a single observation of an oriented point and an affine correspondence. The advantage of our approach (P1AC) is that it requires only a single correspondence, in comparison to the traditional point-based approach (P3P), significantly reducing the combinatorics in robust estimation. P1AC provides a general solution that removes restrictive assumptions made in prior work and is applicable to large-scale image-based localization. We propose a minimal solution to the P1AC problem and evaluate our novel solver on synthetic data, showing its numerical stability and performance under various types of noise. On standard image-based localization benchmarks we show that P1AC achieves more accurate results than the widely used P3P algorithm. Code for our method is available at https://github.com/jonathanventura/P1AC/ ."
2011.09190,CVEGAN: A Perceptually-inspired GAN for Compressed Video Enhancement,"We propose a new Generative Adversarial Network for Compressed Video quality Enhancement (CVEGAN). The CVEGAN generator benefits from the use of a novel Mul2Res block (with multiple levels of residual learning branches), an enhanced residual non-local block (ERNB) and an enhanced convolutional block attention module (ECBAM). The ERNB has also been employed in the discriminator to improve the representational capability. The training strategy has also been re-designed specifically for video compression applications, to employ a relativistic sphere GAN (ReSphereGAN) training methodology together with new perceptual loss functions. The proposed network has been fully evaluated in the context of two typical video compression enhancement tools: post-processing (PP) and spatial resolution adaptation (SRA). CVEGAN has been fully integrated into the MPEG HEVC video coding test model (HM16.20) and experimental results demonstrate significant coding gains (up to 28% for PP and 38% for SRA compared to the anchor) over existing state-of-the-art architectures for both coding tools across multiple datasets."
2011.09789,An Experimental Study of Semantic Continuity for Deep Learning Models,"Deep learning models suffer from the problem of semantic discontinuity: small perturbations in the input space tend to cause semantic-level interference to the model output. We argue that the semantic discontinuity results from these inappropriate training targets and contributes to notorious issues such as adversarial robustness, interpretability, etc. We first conduct data analysis to provide evidence of semantic discontinuity in existing deep learning models, and then design a simple semantic continuity constraint which theoretically enables models to obtain smooth gradients and learn semantic-oriented features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments prove that semantically continuous models successfully reduce the use of non-semantic information, which further contributes to the improvement in adversarial robustness, interpretability, model transfer, and machine bias."
2011.10471,Online Descriptor Enhancement via Self-Labelling Triplets for Visual   Data Association,"Object-level data association is central to robotic applications such as tracking-by-detection and object-level simultaneous localization and mapping. While current learned visual data association methods outperform hand-crafted algorithms, many rely on large collections of domain-specific training examples that can be difficult to obtain without prior knowledge. Additionally, such methods often remain fixed during inference-time and do not harness observed information to better their performance. We propose a self-supervised method for incrementally refining visual descriptors to improve performance in the task of object-level visual data association. Our method optimizes deep descriptor generators online, by continuously training a widely available image classification network pre-trained with domain-independent data. We show that earlier layers in the network outperform later-stage layers for the data association task while also allowing for a 94% reduction in the number of parameters, enabling the online optimization. We show that self-labelling challenging triplets--choosing positive examples separated by large temporal distances and negative examples close in the descriptor space--improves the quality of the learned descriptors for the multi-object tracking task. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses other visual data-association methods applied to a tracking-by-detection task, and show that it provides better performance-gains when compared to other methods that attempt to adapt to observed information."
2011.10510,Seismic Facies Analysis: A Deep Domain Adaptation Approach,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn accurately from large quantities of labeled input data, but often fail to do so when labelled data are scarce. DNNs sometimes fail to generalize ontest data sampled from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)techniques have been proven useful when no labels are available, and when distribution shifts are observed in the target domain (TD). In the present study, experiments are performed on seismic images of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. A deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images when few classes have data scarcity, and we use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy >84% and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduce the CORAL (Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections from F3 and Penobscot, to demonstrate possible approaches when labelled data are unavailable. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of Penobscot, with an overall accuracy>50%. Taken together, the EAN-DDA has the potential to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy."
2011.11452,Multi-task Learning for Human Settlement Extent Regression and Local   Climate Zone Classification,"Human Settlement Extent (HSE) and Local Climate Zone (LCZ) maps are both essential sources, e.g., for sustainable urban development and Urban Heat Island (UHI) studies. Remote sensing (RS)- and deep learning (DL)-based classification approaches play a significant role by providing the potential for global mapping. However, most of the efforts only focus on one of the two schemes, usually on a specific scale. This leads to unnecessary redundancies, since the learned features could be leveraged for both of these related tasks. In this letter, the concept of multi-task learning (MTL) is introduced to HSE regression and LCZ classification for the first time. We propose a MTL framework and develop an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which consists of a backbone network for shared feature learning, attention modules for task-specific feature learning, and a weighting strategy for balancing the two tasks. We additionally propose to exploit HSE predictions as a prior for LCZ classification to enhance the accuracy. The MTL approach was extensively tested with Sentinel-2 data of 13 cities across the world. The results demonstrate that the framework is able to provide a competitive solution for both tasks."
2011.11906,Spatiotemporal Imaging with Diffeomorphic Optimal Transportation,"We propose a variational model with diffeomorphic optimal transportation for joint image reconstruction and motion estimation. The proposed model is a production of assembling the Wasserstein distance with the Benamou--Brenier formula in optimal transportation and the flow of diffeomorphisms involved in large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, which is suitable for the scenario of spatiotemporal imaging with large diffeomorphic and mass-preserving deformations. Specifically, we first use the Benamou--Brenier formula to characterize the optimal transport cost among the flow of mass-preserving images, and restrict the velocity field into the admissible Hilbert space to guarantee the generated deformation flow being diffeomorphic. We then gain the ODE-constrained equivalent formulation for Benamou--Brenier formula. We finally obtain the proposed model with ODE constraint following the framework that presented in our previous work. We further get the equivalent PDE-constrained optimal control formulation. The proposed model is compared against several existing alternatives theoretically. The alternating minimization algorithm is presented for solving the time-discretized version of the proposed model with ODE constraint. Several important issues on the proposed model and associated algorithms are also discussed. Particularly, we present several potential models based on the proposed diffeomorphic optimal transportation. Under appropriate conditions, the proposed algorithm also provides a new scheme to solve the models using quadratic Wasserstein distance. The performance is finally evaluated by several numerical experiments in space-time tomography, where the data is measured from the concerned sequential images with sparse views and/or various noise levels."
2011.12267,A Framework for Fluid Motion Estimation using a Constraint-Based   Refinement Approach,"Physics-based optical flow models have been successful in capturing the deformities in fluid motion arising from digital imagery. However, a common theoretical framework analyzing several physics-based models is missing. In this regard, we formulate a general framework for fluid motion estimation using a constraint-based refinement approach. We demonstrate that for a particular choice of constraint, our results closely approximate the classical continuity equation-based method for fluid flow. This closeness is theoretically justified by augmented Lagrangian method in a novel way. The convergence of Uzawa iterates is shown using a modified bounded constraint algorithm. The mathematical wellposedness is studied in a Hilbert space setting. Further, we observe a surprising connection to the Cauchy-Riemann operator that diagonalizes the system leading to a diffusive phenomenon involving the divergence and the curl of the flow. Several numerical experiments are performed and the results are shown on different datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that a flow-driven refinement process involving the curl of the flow outperforms the classical physics-based optical flow method without any additional assumptions on the image data."
2011.13209,Handling Object Symmetries in CNN-based Pose Estimation,"In this paper, we investigate the problems that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based pose estimators have with symmetric objects. We considered the value of the CNN's output representation when continuously rotating the object and found that it has to form a closed loop after each step of symmetry. Otherwise, the CNN (which is itself a continuous function) has to replicate an uncontinuous function. On a 1-DOF toy example we show that commonly used representations do not fulfill this demand and analyze the problems caused thereby. In particular, we find that the popular min-over-symmetries approach for creating a symmetry-aware loss tends not to work well with gradient-based optimization, i.e. deep learning.   We propose a representation called ""closed symmetry loop"" (csl) from these insights, where the angle of relevant vectors is multiplied by the symmetry order and then generalize it to 6-DOF. The representation extends our algorithm from [Richter-Klug, ICVS, 2019] including a method to disambiguate symmetric equivalents during the final pose estimation. The algorithm handles continuous rotational symmetry (e.g. a bottle) and discrete rotational symmetry (e.g. a 4-fold symmetric box). It is evaluated on the T-LESS dataset, where it reaches state-of-the-art for unrefining RGB-based methods."
2011.13705,3D Invisible Cloak,"In this paper, we propose a novel physical stealth attack against the person detectors in real world. The proposed method generates an adversarial patch, and prints it on real clothes to make a three dimensional (3D) invisible cloak. Anyone wearing the cloak can evade the detection of person detectors and achieve stealth. We consider the impacts of those 3D physical constraints (i.e., radian, wrinkle, occlusion, angle, etc.) on person stealth attacks, and propose 3D transformations to generate 3D invisible cloak. We launch the person stealth attacks in 3D physical space instead of 2D plane by printing the adversarial patches on real clothes under challenging and complex 3D physical scenarios. The conventional and 3D transformations are performed on the patch during its optimization process. Further, we study how to generate the optimal 3D invisible cloak. Specifically, we explore how to choose input images with specific shapes and colors to generate the optimal 3D invisible cloak. Besides, after successfully making the object detector misjudge the person as other objects, we explore how to make a person completely disappeared, i.e., the person will not be detected as any objects. Finally, we present a systematic evaluation framework to methodically evaluate the performance of the proposed attack in digital domain and physical world. Experimental results in various indoor and outdoor physical scenarios show that, the proposed person stealth attack method is robust and effective even under those complex and challenging physical conditions, such as the cloak is wrinkled, obscured, curved, and from different angles. The attack success rate in digital domain (Inria data set) is 86.56%, while the static and dynamic stealth attack performance in physical world is 100% and 77%, respectively, which are significantly better than existing works."
2011.13714,Detection of Malaria Vector Breeding Habitats using Topographic Models,"Treatment of stagnant water bodies that act as a breeding site for malarial vectors is a fundamental step in most malaria elimination campaigns. However, identification of such water bodies over large areas is expensive, labour-intensive and time-consuming and hence, challenging in countries with limited resources. Practical models that can efficiently locate water bodies can target the limited resources by greatly reducing the area that needs to be scanned by the field workers. To this end, we propose a practical topographic model based on easily available, global, high-resolution DEM data to predict locations of potential vector-breeding water sites. We surveyed the Obuasi region of Ghana to assess the impact of various topographic features on different types of water bodies and uncover the features that significantly influence the formation of aquatic habitats. We further evaluate the effectiveness of multiple models. Our best model significantly outperforms earlier attempts that employ topographic variables for detection of small water sites, even the ones that utilize additional satellite imagery data and demonstrates robustness across different settings."
2011.14107,"Hijack-GAN: Unintended-Use of Pretrained, Black-Box GANs","While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show increasing performance and the level of realism is becoming indistinguishable from natural images, this also comes with high demands on data and computation. We show that state-of-the-art GAN models -- such as they are being publicly released by researchers and industry -- can be used for a range of applications beyond unconditional image generation. We achieve this by an iterative scheme that also allows gaining control over the image generation process despite the highly non-linear latent spaces of the latest GAN models. We demonstrate that this opens up the possibility to re-use state-of-the-art, difficult to train, pre-trained GANs with a high level of control even if only black-box access is granted. Our work also raises concerns and awareness that the use cases of a published GAN model may well reach beyond the creators' intention, which needs to be taken into account before a full public release. Code is available at https://github.com/hui-po-wang/hijackgan."
2011.14598,Video Self-Stitching Graph Network for Temporal Action Localization,"Temporal action localization (TAL) in videos is a challenging task, especially due to the large variation in action temporal scales. Short actions usually occupy a major proportion in the datasets, but tend to have the lowest performance. In this paper, we confront the challenge of short actions and propose a multi-level cross-scale solution dubbed as video self-stitching graph network (VSGN). We have two key components in VSGN: video self-stitching (VSS) and cross-scale graph pyramid network (xGPN). In VSS, we focus on a short period of a video and magnify it along the temporal dimension to obtain a larger scale. We stitch the original clip and its magnified counterpart in one input sequence to take advantage of the complementary properties of both scales. The xGPN component further exploits the cross-scale correlations by a pyramid of cross-scale graph networks, each containing a hybrid module to aggregate features from across scales as well as within the same scale. Our VSGN not only enhances the feature representations, but also generates more positive anchors for short actions and more short training samples. Experiments demonstrate that VSGN obviously improves the localization performance of short actions as well as achieving the state-of-the-art overall performance on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3."
2011.14759,Scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks,"This paper presents a hybrid approach between scale-space theory and deep learning, where a deep learning architecture is constructed by coupling parameterized scale-space operations in cascade. By sharing the learnt parameters between multiple scale channels, and by using the transformation properties of the scale-space primitives under scaling transformations, the resulting network becomes provably scale covariant. By in addition performing max pooling over the multiple scale channels, a resulting network architecture for image classification also becomes provably scale invariant. We investigate the performance of such networks on the MNISTLargeScale dataset, which contains rescaled images from original MNIST over a factor of 4 concerning training data and over a factor of 16 concerning testing data. It is demonstrated that the resulting approach allows for scale generalization, enabling good performance for classifying patterns at scales not present in the training data."
2011.14814,Cost Function Unrolling in Unsupervised Optical Flow,"Steepest descent algorithms, which are commonly used in deep learning, use the gradient as the descent direction, either as-is or after a direction shift using preconditioning. In many scenarios calculating the gradient is numerically hard due to complex or non-differentiable cost functions, specifically next to singular points. In this work we focus on the derivation of the Total Variation semi-norm commonly used in unsupervised cost functions. Specifically, we derive a differentiable proxy to the hard L1 smoothness constraint in a novel iterative scheme which we refer to as Cost Unrolling. Producing more accurate gradients during training, our method enables finer predictions of a given DNN model through improved convergence, without modifying its architecture or increasing computational complexity. We demonstrate our method in the unsupervised optical flow task. Replacing the L1 smoothness constraint with our unrolled cost during the training of a well known baseline, we report improved results on both MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015 unsupervised optical flow benchmarks. Particularly, we report EPE reduced by up to 15.82% on occluded pixels, where the smoothness constraint is dominant, enabling the detection of much sharper motion edges."
2011.14956,Handling Noisy Labels via One-Step Abductive Multi-Target Learning and   Its Application to Helicobacter Pylori Segmentation,"Learning from noisy labels is an important concern in plenty of real-world scenarios. Various approaches for this concern first make corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update predictive model with information of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often difficult or impossible for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free ground-truth labels which leads to labels with complex noise. This situation raises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has limitations due to the complex noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate evaluation strategy for validation/testing is unclear because of the great difficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels. For the problem 1), we present one-step abductive multi-target learning (OSAMTL) that imposes a one-step logical reasoning upon machine learning via a multi-target learning procedure to constrain the predictions of the learning model to be subject to our prior knowledge about the true target. For the problem 2), we propose a logical assessment formula (LAF) that evaluates the logical rationality of the outputs of an approach by estimating the consistencies between the predictions of the learning model and the logical facts narrated from the results of the one-step logical reasoning of OSAMTL. Based on the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL enables the machine learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which is beyond various state-of-the-art approaches in handling complex noisy labels."
2012.00437,A Unified Structure for Efficient RGB and RGB-D Salient Object Detection,"Salient object detection (SOD) has been well studied in recent years, especially using deep neural networks. However, SOD with RGB and RGB-D images is usually treated as two different tasks with different network structures that need to be designed specifically. In this paper, we proposed a unified and efficient structure with a cross-attention context extraction (CRACE) module to address both tasks of SOD efficiently. The proposed CRACE module receives and appropriately fuses two (for RGB SOD) or three (for RGB-D SOD) inputs. The simple unified feature pyramid network (FPN)-like structure with CRACE modules conveys and refines the results under the multi-level supervisions of saliency and boundaries. The proposed structure is simple yet effective; the rich context information of RGB and depth can be appropriately extracted and fused by the proposed structure efficiently. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both RGB and RGB-D SOD tasks on various datasets and in terms of most metrics."
2012.00650,"Decomposition, Compression, and Synthesis (DCS)-based Video Coding: A   Neural Exploration via Resolution-Adaptive Learning","Inspired by the facts that retinal cells actually segregate the visual scene into different attributes (e.g., spatial details, temporal motion) for respective neuronal processing, we propose to first decompose the input video into respective spatial texture frames (STF) at its native spatial resolution that preserve the rich spatial details, and the other temporal motion frames (TMF) at a lower spatial resolution that retain the motion smoothness; then compress them together using any popular video coder; and finally synthesize decoded STFs and TMFs for high-fidelity video reconstruction at the same resolution as its native input. This work simply applies the bicubic resampling in decomposition and HEVC compliant codec in compression, and puts the focus on the synthesis part. For resolution-adaptive synthesis, a motion compensation network (MCN) is devised on TMFs to efficiently align and aggregate temporal motion features that will be jointly processed with corresponding STFs using a non-local texture transfer network (NL-TTN) to better augment spatial details, by which the compression and resolution resampling noises can be effectively alleviated with better rate-distortion efficiency. Such ""Decomposition, Compression, Synthesis (DCS)"" based scheme is codec agnostic, currently exemplifying averaged $\approx$1 dB PSNR gain or $\approx$25% BD-rate saving, against the HEVC anchor using reference software. In addition, experimental comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies are conducted to further report the efficiency and generalization of DCS algorithm, promising an encouraging direction for future video coding."
2012.01321,Red Blood Cell Segmentation with Overlapping Cell Separation and   Classification on Imbalanced Dataset,"Automated red blood cell (RBC) classification on blood smear images helps hematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However, overlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be separated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple classes with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging because normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper presents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images, specifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing on overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates ellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then finds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood smear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets. However, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was 34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of machine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence more challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal with this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679, respectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results showed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential to deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes, while data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification performance."
2012.01494,Braille to Text Translation for Bengali Language: A Geometric Approach,"Braille is the only system to visually impaired people for reading and writing. However, general people cannot read Braille. So, teachers and relatives find it hard to assist them with learning. Almost every major language has software solutions for this translation purpose. However, in Bengali there is an absence of this useful tool. Here, we propose Braille to Text Translator, which takes image of these tactile alphabets, and translates them to plain text. Image deterioration, scan-time page rotation, and braille dot deformation are the principal issues in this scheme. All of these challenges are directly checked using special image processing and geometric structure analysis. The technique yields 97.25% accuracy in recognizing Braille characters."
2012.01944,Multi-Label Contrastive Learning for Abstract Visual Reasoning,"For a long time the ability to solve abstract reasoning tasks was considered one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. Recent advances in application of deep learning (DL) methods led, as in many other domains, to surpassing human abstract reasoning performance, specifically in the most popular type of such problems - the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs). While the efficacy of DL systems is indeed impressive, the way they approach the RPMs is very different from that of humans. State-of-the-art systems solving RPMs rely on massive pattern-based training and sometimes on exploiting biases in the dataset, whereas humans concentrate on identification of the rules / concepts underlying the RPM (or generally a visual reasoning task) to be solved. Motivated by this cognitive difference, this work aims at combining DL with human way of solving RPMs and getting the best of both worlds. Specifically, we cast the problem of solving RPMs into multi-label classification framework where each RPM is viewed as a multi-label data point, with labels determined by the set of abstract rules underlying the RPM. For efficient training of the system we introduce a generalisation of the Noise Contrastive Estimation algorithm to the case of multi-label samples. Furthermore, we propose a new sparse rule encoding scheme for RPMs which, besides the new training algorithm, is the key factor contributing to the state-of-the-art performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two most popular benchmark datasets (Balanced-RAVEN and PGM) and on both of them demonstrates an advantage over the current state-of-the-art results. Contrary to applications of contrastive learning methods reported in other domains, the state-of-the-art performance reported in the paper is achieved with no need for large batch sizes or strong data augmentation."
2012.02689,Isometric Multi-Shape Matching,"Finding correspondences between shapes is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics, which is relevant for many applications, including 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and style transfer. The vast majority of correspondence methods aim to find a solution between pairs of shapes, even if multiple instances of the same class are available. While isometries are often studied in shape correspondence problems, they have not been considered explicitly in the multi-matching setting. This paper closes this gap by proposing a novel optimisation formulation for isometric multi-shape matching. We present a suitable optimisation algorithm for solving our formulation and provide a convergence and complexity analysis. Our algorithm obtains multi-matchings that are by construction provably cycle-consistent. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on various datasets and set the new state-of-the-art in isometric multi-shape matching."
2012.02738,Ultrasound Scatterer Density Classification Using Convolutional Neural   Networks by Exploiting Patch Statistics,"Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) can reveal crucial information on tissue properties such as scatterer density. If the scatterer density per resolution cell is above or below 10, the tissue is considered as fully developed speckle (FDS) or low-density scatterers (LDS), respectively. Conventionally, the scatterer density has been classified using estimated statistical parameters of the amplitude of backscattered echoes. However, if the patch size is small, the estimation is not accurate. These parameters are also highly dependent on imaging settings. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for QUS, and train it using simulation data. We further improve the network performance by utilizing patch statistics as additional input channels. We evaluate the network using simulation data, experimental phantoms and in vivo data. We also compare our proposed network with different classic and deep learning models, and demonstrate its superior performance in classification of tissues with different scatterer density values. The results also show that the proposed network is able to work with different imaging parameters with no need for a reference phantom. This work demonstrates the potential of CNNs in classifying scatterer density in ultrasound images."
2012.03021,Depth estimation from 4D light field videos,"Depth (disparity) estimation from 4D Light Field (LF) images has been a research topic for the last couple of years. Most studies have focused on depth estimation from static 4D LF images while not considering temporal information, i.e., LF videos. This paper proposes an end-to-end neural network architecture for depth estimation from 4D LF videos. This study also constructs a medium-scale synthetic 4D LF video dataset that can be used for training deep learning-based methods. Experimental results using synthetic and real-world 4D LF videos show that temporal information contributes to the improvement of depth estimation accuracy in noisy regions. Dataset and code is available at: https://mediaeng-lfv.github.io/LFV_Disparity_Estimation"
2012.03547,Learned Block Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm for   Photothermal Super Resolution Imaging,"Block-sparse regularization is already well-known in active thermal imaging and is used for multiple measurement based inverse problems. The main bottleneck of this method is the choice of regularization parameters which differs for each experiment. To avoid time-consuming manually selected regularization parameter, we propose a learned block-sparse optimization approach using an iterative algorithm unfolded into a deep neural network. More precisely, we show the benefits of using a learned block iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm that is able to learn the choice of regularization parameters. In addition, this algorithm enables the determination of a suitable weight matrix to solve the underlying inverse problem. Therefore, in this paper we present the algorithm and compare it with state of the art block iterative shrinkage thresholding using synthetically generated test data and experimental test data from active thermography for defect reconstruction. Our results show that the use of the learned block-sparse optimization approach provides smaller normalized mean square errors for a small fixed number of iterations than without learning. Thus, this new approach allows to improve the convergence speed and only needs a few iterations to generate accurate defect reconstruction in photothermal super resolution imaging."
2012.04132,A Number Sense as an Emergent Property of the Manipulating Brain,"The ability to understand and manipulate numbers and quantities emerges during childhood, but the mechanism through which humans acquire and develop this ability is still poorly understood. We explore this question through a model, assuming that the learner is able to pick up and place small objects from, and to, locations of its choosing, and will spontaneously engage in such undirected manipulation. We further assume that the learner's visual system will monitor the changing arrangements of objects in the scene and will learn to predict the effects of each action by comparing perception with a supervisory signal from the motor system. We model perception using standard deep networks for feature extraction and classification, and gradient descent learning. Our main finding is that, from learning the task of action prediction, an unexpected image representation emerges exhibiting regularities that foreshadow the perception and representation of numbers and quantity. These include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a strict ordering of the numbers, and a one-dimensional signal that correlates with numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to estimate numerosity, i.e. the number of objects in the scene, as well as subitization, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of objects in small scenes. Remarkably, subitization and numerosity estimation extrapolate to scenes containing many objects, far beyond the three objects used during training. We conclude that important aspects of a facility with numbers and quantities may be learned with supervision from a simple pre-training task. Our observations suggest that cross-modal learning is a powerful learning mechanism that may be harnessed in artificial intelligence."
2012.04726,Edited Media Understanding Frames: Reasoning About the Intent and   Implications of Visual Misinformation,"Multimodal disinformation, from 'deepfakes' to simple edits that deceive, is an important societal problem. Yet at the same time, the vast majority of media edits are harmless -- such as a filtered vacation photo. The difference between this example, and harmful edits that spread disinformation, is one of intent. Recognizing and describing this intent is a major challenge for today's AI systems.   We present the task of Edited Media Understanding, requiring models to answer open-ended questions that capture the intent and implications of an image edit. We introduce a dataset for our task, EMU, with 48k question-answer pairs written in rich natural language. We evaluate a wide variety of vision-and-language models for our task, and introduce a new model PELICAN, which builds upon recent progress in pretrained multimodal representations. Our model obtains promising results on our dataset, with humans rating its answers as accurate 40.35% of the time. At the same time, there is still much work to be done -- humans prefer human-annotated captions 93.56% of the time -- and we provide analysis that highlights areas for further progress."
2012.05616,Enhancing Human Pose Estimation in Ancient Vase Paintings via   Perceptually-grounded Style Transfer Learning,"Human pose estimation (HPE) is a central part of understanding the visual narration and body movements of characters depicted in artwork collections, such as Greek vase paintings. Unfortunately, existing HPE methods do not generalise well across domains resulting in poorly recognized poses. Therefore, we propose a two step approach: (1) adapting a dataset of natural images of known person and pose annotations to the style of Greek vase paintings by means of image style-transfer. We introduce a perceptually-grounded style transfer training to enforce perceptual consistency. Then, we fine-tune the base model with this newly created dataset. We show that using style-transfer learning significantly improves the SOTA performance on unlabelled data by more than 6% mean average precision (mAP) as well as mean average recall (mAR). (2) To improve the already strong results further, we created a small dataset (ClassArch) consisting of ancient Greek vase paintings from the 6-5th century BCE with person and pose annotations. We show that fine-tuning on this data with a style-transferred model improves the performance further. In a thorough ablation study, we give a targeted analysis of the influence of style intensities, revealing that the model learns generic domain styles. Additionally, we provide a pose-based image retrieval to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
2012.06746,Periocular Embedding Learning with Consistent Knowledge Distillation   from Face,"Periocular biometric, the peripheral area of the ocular, is a collaborative alternative to the face, especially when the face is occluded or masked. However, in practice, sole periocular biometric capture the least salient facial features, thereby lacking discriminative information, particularly in wild environments. To address these problems, we transfer discriminatory information from the face to support the training of a periocular network by using knowledge distillation. Specifically, we leverage face images for periocular embedding learning, but periocular alone is utilized for identity identification or verification. To enhance periocular embeddings by face effectively, we proposeConsistent Knowledge Distillation (CKD) that imposes consistency between face and periocular networks across prediction and feature layers. We find that imposing consistency at the prediction layer enables (1) extraction of global discriminative relationship information from face images and (2) effective transfer of the information from the face network to the periocular network. Particularly, consistency regularizes the prediction units to extract and store profound inter-class relationship information of face images. (3) The feature layer consistency, on the other hand, makes the periocular features robust against identity-irrelevant attributes. Overall, CKD empowers the sole periocular network to produce robust discriminative embeddings for periocular recognition in the wild. We theoretically and empirically validate the core principles of the distillation mechanism in CKD, discovering that CKD is equivalent to label smoothing with a novel sparsity-oriented regularizer that helps the network prediction to capture the global discriminative relationship. Extensive experiments reveal that CKD achieves state-of-the-art results on standard periocular recognition benchmark datasets."
2012.07139,FSOCO: The Formula Student Objects in Context Dataset,"This paper presents the FSOCO dataset, a collaborative dataset for vision-based cone detection systems in Formula Student Driverless competitions. It contains human annotated ground truth labels for both bounding boxes and instance-wise segmentation masks. The data buy-in philosophy of FSOCO asks student teams to contribute to the database first before being granted access ensuring continuous growth. By providing clear labeling guidelines and tools for a sophisticated raw image selection, new annotations are guaranteed to meet the desired quality. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by comparing prediction results of a network trained on FSOCO and its unregulated predecessor. The FSOCO dataset can be found at https://fsoco.github.io/fsoco-dataset/."
2012.08678,Improved Digital Therapy for Developmental Pediatrics Using   Domain-Specific Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Study,"Background: Automated emotion classification could aid those who struggle to recognize emotions, including children with developmental behavioral conditions such as autism. However, most computer vision emotion recognition models are trained on adult emotion and therefore underperform when applied to child faces. Objective: We designed a strategy to gamify the collection and labeling of child emotion-enriched images to boost the performance of automatic child emotion recognition models to a level closer to what will be needed for digital health care approaches. Methods: We leveraged our prototype therapeutic smartphone game, GuessWhat, which was designed in large part for children with developmental and behavioral conditions, to gamify the secure collection of video data of children expressing a variety of emotions prompted by the game. Independently, we created a secure web interface to gamify the human labeling effort, called HollywoodSquares, tailored for use by any qualified labeler. We gathered and labeled 2155 videos, 39,968 emotion frames, and 106,001 labels on all images. With this drastically expanded pediatric emotion-centric database (>30 times larger than existing public pediatric emotion data sets), we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) computer vision classifier of happy, sad, surprised, fearful, angry, disgust, and neutral expressions evoked by children. Results: The classifier achieved a 66.9% balanced accuracy and 67.4% F1-score on the entirety of the Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) as well as a 79.1% balanced accuracy and 78% F1-score on CAFE Subset A, a subset containing at least 60% human agreement on emotions labels. This performance is at least 10% higher than all previously developed classifiers evaluated against CAFE, the best of which reached a 56% balanced accuracy even when combining ""anger"" and ""disgust"" into a single class."
2012.08939,SS-SFDA : Self-Supervised Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Road   Segmentation in Hazardous Environments,"We present a novel approach for unsupervised road segmentation in adverse weather conditions such as rain or fog. This includes a new algorithm for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) using self-supervised learning. Moreover, our approach uses several techniques to address various challenges in SFDA and improve performance, including online generation of pseudo-labels and self-attention as well as use of curriculum learning, entropy minimization and model distillation. We have evaluated the performance on $6$ datasets corresponding to real and synthetic adverse weather conditions. Our method outperforms all prior works on unsupervised road segmentation and SFDA by at least 10.26%, and improves the training time by 18-180x. Moreover, our self-supervised algorithm exhibits similar accuracy performance in terms of mIOU score as compared to prior supervised methods."
2012.11696,Image Captioning as an Assistive Technology: Lessons Learned from VizWiz   2020 Challenge,"Image captioning has recently demonstrated impressive progress largely owing to the introduction of neural network algorithms trained on curated dataset like MS-COCO. Often work in this field is motivated by the promise of deployment of captioning systems in practical applications. However, the scarcity of data and contexts in many competition datasets renders the utility of systems trained on these datasets limited as an assistive technology in real-world settings, such as helping visually impaired people navigate and accomplish everyday tasks. This gap motivated the introduction of the novel VizWiz dataset, which consists of images taken by the visually impaired and captions that have useful, task-oriented information. In an attempt to help the machine learning computer vision field realize its promise of producing technologies that have positive social impact, the curators of the VizWiz dataset host several competitions, including one for image captioning. This work details the theory and engineering from our winning submission to the 2020 captioning competition. Our work provides a step towards improved assistive image captioning systems."
2012.11803,Modeling Deep Learning Based Privacy Attacks on Physical Mail,"Mail privacy protection aims to prevent unauthorized access to hidden content within an envelope since normal paper envelopes are not as safe as we think. In this paper, for the first time, we show that with a well designed deep learning model, the hidden content may be largely recovered without opening the envelope. We start by modeling deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail content as learning the mapping from the camera-captured envelope front face image to the hidden content, then we explicitly model the mapping as a combination of perspective transformation, image dehazing and denoising using a deep convolutional neural network, named Neural-STE (See-Through-Envelope). We show experimentally that hidden content details, such as texture and image structure, can be clearly recovered. Finally, our formulation and model allow us to design envelopes that can counter deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail."
2012.12311,Unboxing Engagement in YouTube Influencer Videos: An Attention-Based Approach,"Influencer marketing has become a widely used strategy for reaching customers. Despite growing interest among influencers and brand partners in predicting engagement with influencer videos, there has been little research on the relative importance of different video data modalities in predicting engagement. We analyze unstructured data from long-form YouTube influencer videos - spanning text, audio, and video images - using an interpretable deep learning framework that leverages model attention to video elements. This framework enables strong out-of-sample prediction, followed by ex-post interpretation using a novel approach that prunes spurious associations. Our prediction-based results reveal that ""what is said"" through words (text) is more important than ""how it is said"" through imagery (video images) or acoustics (audio) in predicting video engagement. Interpretation-based findings show that during the critical onset period of a video (first 30 seconds), auditory stimuli (e.g., brand mentions and music) are associated with sentiment expressed in verbal engagement (comments), while visual stimuli (e.g., video images of humans and packaged goods) are linked with sentiment expressed through non-verbal engagement (the thumbs-up/down ratio). We validate our approach through multiple methods, connect our findings to relevant theory, and discuss implications for influencers, brands and agencies."
2012.12437,Pit30M: A Benchmark for Global Localization in the Age of Self-Driving   Cars,"We are interested in understanding whether retrieval-based localization approaches are good enough in the context of self-driving vehicles. Towards this goal, we introduce Pit30M, a new image and LiDAR dataset with over 30 million frames, which is 10 to 100 times larger than those used in previous work. Pit30M is captured under diverse conditions (i.e., season, weather, time of the day, traffic), and provides accurate localization ground truth. We also automatically annotate our dataset with historical weather and astronomical data, as well as with image and LiDAR semantic segmentation as a proxy measure for occlusion. We benchmark multiple existing methods for image and LiDAR retrieval and, in the process, introduce a simple, yet effective convolutional network-based LiDAR retrieval method that is competitive with the state of the art. Our work provides, for the first time, a benchmark for sub-metre retrieval-based localization at city scale. The dataset, its Python SDK, as well as more information about the sensors, calibration, and metadata, are available on the project website: https://pit30m.github.io/"
2012.13113,FracTrain: Fractionally Squeezing Bit Savings Both Temporally and   Spatially for Efficient DNN Training,"Recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks (DNNs) have fueled a tremendous demand for intelligent edge devices featuring on-site learning, while the practical realization of such systems remains a challenge due to the limited resources available at the edge and the required massive training costs for state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs. As reducing precision is one of the most effective knobs for boosting training time/energy efficiency, there has been a growing interest in low-precision DNN training. In this paper, we explore from an orthogonal direction: how to fractionally squeeze out more training cost savings from the most redundant bit level, progressively along the training trajectory and dynamically per input. Specifically, we propose FracTrain that integrates (i) progressive fractional quantization which gradually increases the precision of activations, weights, and gradients that will not reach the precision of SOTA static quantized DNN training until the final training stage, and (ii) dynamic fractional quantization which assigns precisions to both the activations and gradients of each layer in an input-adaptive manner, for only ""fractionally"" updating layer parameters. Extensive simulations and ablation studies (six models, four datasets, and three training settings including standard, adaptation, and fine-tuning) validate the effectiveness of FracTrain in reducing computational cost and hardware-quantified energy/latency of DNN training while achieving a comparable or better (-0.12%~+1.87%) accuracy. For example, when training ResNet-74 on CIFAR-10, FracTrain achieves 77.6% and 53.5% computational cost and training latency savings, respectively, compared with the best SOTA baseline, while achieving a comparable (-0.07%) accuracy. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/RICE-EIC/FracTrain."
2012.14331,Methods to integrate multinormals and compute classification measures,"Univariate and multivariate normal probability distributions are widely used when modeling decisions under uncertainty. Computing the performance of such models requires integrating these distributions over specific domains, which can vary widely across models. Besides some special cases, there exist no general analytical expressions, standard numerical methods or software for these integrals. Here we present mathematical results and open-source software that provide (i) the probability in any domain of a normal in any dimensions with any parameters, (ii) the probability density, cumulative distribution, and inverse cumulative distribution of any function of a normal vector, (iii) the classification errors among any number of normal distributions, the Bayes-optimal discriminability index and relation to the operating characteristic, (iv) ways to scale the discriminability of two distributions, (v) dimension reduction and visualizations for such problems, and (vi) tests for how reliably these methods may be used on given data. We demonstrate these tools with vision research applications of detecting occluding objects in natural scenes, and detecting camouflage."
2101.00203,B-SMALL: A Bayesian Neural Network approach to Sparse Model-Agnostic   Meta-Learning,"There is a growing interest in the learning-to-learn paradigm, also known as meta-learning, where models infer on new tasks using a few training examples. Recently, meta-learning based methods have been widely used in few-shot classification, regression, reinforcement learning, and domain adaptation. The model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm is a well-known algorithm that obtains model parameter initialization at meta-training phase. In the meta-test phase, this initialization is rapidly adapted to new tasks by using gradient descent. However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting since there are insufficient training tasks resulting in over-parameterized models with poor generalization performance for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian neural network based MAML algorithm, which we refer to as the B-SMALL algorithm. The proposed framework incorporates a sparse variational loss term alongside the loss function of MAML, which uses a sparsifying approximated KL divergence as a regularizer. We demonstrate the performance of B-MAML using classification and regression tasks, and highlight that training a sparsifying BNN using MAML indeed improves the parameter footprint of the model while performing at par or even outperforming the MAML approach. We also illustrate applicability of our approach in distributed sensor networks, where sparsity and meta-learning can be beneficial."
2101.00337,Biologically Inspired Hexagonal Deep Learning for Hexagonal Image   Generation,"Whereas conventional state-of-the-art image processing systems of recording and output devices almost exclusively utilize square arranged methods, biological models, however, suggest an alternative, evolutionarily-based structure. Inspired by the human visual perception system, hexagonal image processing in the context of machine learning offers a number of key advantages that can benefit both researchers and users alike. The hexagonal deep learning framework Hexnet leveraged in this contribution serves therefore the generation of hexagonal images by utilizing hexagonal deep neural networks (H-DNN). As the results of our created test environment show, the proposed models can surpass current approaches of conventional image generation. While resulting in a reduction of the models' complexity in the form of trainable parameters, they furthermore allow an increase of test rates in comparison to their square counterparts."
2101.00814,Single-shot fringe projection profilometry based on Deep Learning and   Computer Graphics,"Multiple works have applied deep learning to fringe projection profilometry (FPP) in recent years. However, to obtain a large amount of data from actual systems for training is still a tricky problem, and moreover, the network design and optimization still worth exploring. In this paper, we introduce computer graphics to build virtual FPP systems in order to generate the desired datasets conveniently and simply. The way of constructing a virtual FPP system is described in detail firstly, and then some key factors to set the virtual FPP system much close to the reality are analyzed. With the aim of accurately estimating the depth image from only one fringe image, we also design a new loss function to enhance the quality of the overall and detailed information restored. And two representative networks, U-Net and pix2pix, are compared in multiple aspects. The real experiments prove the good accuracy and generalization of the network trained by the data from our virtual systems and the designed loss, implying the potential of our method for applications."
2101.01036,VIS30K: A Collection of Figures and Tables from IEEE Visualization   Conference Publications,"We present the VIS30K dataset, a collection of 29,689 images that represents 30 years of figures and tables from each track of the IEEE Visualization conference series (Vis, SciVis, InfoVis, VAST). VIS30K's comprehensive coverage of the scientific literature in visualization not only reflects the progress of the field but also enables researchers to study the evolution of the state-of-the-art and to find relevant work based on graphical content. We describe the dataset and our semi-automatic collection process, which couples convolutional neural networks (CNN) with curation. Extracting figures and tables semi-automatically allows us to verify that no images are overlooked or extracted erroneously. To improve quality further, we engaged in a peer-search process for high-quality figures from early IEEE Visualization papers. With the resulting data, we also contribute VISImageNavigator (VIN, visimagenavigator.github.io), a web-based tool that facilitates searching and exploring VIS30K by author names, paper keywords, title and abstract, and years."
2101.01456,WildDeepfake: A Challenging Real-World Dataset for Deepfake Detection,"In recent years, the abuse of a face swap technique called deepfake has raised enormous public concerns. So far, a large number of deepfake videos (known as ""deepfakes"") have been crafted and uploaded to the internet, calling for effective countermeasures. One promising countermeasure against deepfakes is deepfake detection. Several deepfake datasets have been released to support the training and testing of deepfake detectors, such as DeepfakeDetection and FaceForensics++. While this has greatly advanced deepfake detection, most of the real videos in these datasets are filmed with a few volunteer actors in limited scenes, and the fake videos are crafted by researchers using a few popular deepfake softwares. Detectors developed on these datasets may become less effective against real-world deepfakes on the internet. To better support detection against real-world deepfakes, in this paper, we introduce a new dataset WildDeepfake which consists of 7,314 face sequences extracted from 707 deepfake videos collected completely from the internet. WildDeepfake is a small dataset that can be used, in addition to existing datasets, to develop and test the effectiveness of deepfake detectors against real-world deepfakes. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a set of baseline detection networks on both existing and our WildDeepfake datasets, and show that WildDeepfake is indeed a more challenging dataset, where the detection performance can decrease drastically. We also propose two (eg. 2D and 3D) Attention-based Deepfake Detection Networks (ADDNets) to leverage the attention masks on real/fake faces for improved detection. We empirically verify the effectiveness of ADDNets on both existing datasets and WildDeepfake. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/OpenTAI/wild-deepfake."
2101.02523,Few-Shot Learning with Class Imbalance,"Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms are commonly trained through Meta-Learning (ML), which exposes models to batches of tasks sampled from a meta-dataset to mimic tasks seen during evaluation. However, the standard training procedures overlook the real-world dynamics where classes commonly occur at different frequencies. While it is generally understood that class imbalance harms the performance of supervised methods, limited research examines the impact of imbalance on the FSL evaluation task. Our analysis compares 10 state-of-the-art meta-learning and FSL methods on different imbalance distributions and rebalancing techniques. Our results reveal that 1) some FSL methods display a natural disposition against imbalance while most other approaches produce a performance drop by up to 17\% compared to the balanced task without the appropriate mitigation; 2) contrary to popular belief, many meta-learning algorithms will not automatically learn to balance from exposure to imbalanced training tasks; 3) classical rebalancing strategies, such as random oversampling, can still be very effective, leading to state-of-the-art performances and should not be overlooked; 4) FSL methods are more robust against meta-dataset imbalance than imbalance at the task-level with a similar imbalance ratio ($\rho<20$), with the effect holding even in long-tail datasets under a larger imbalance ($\rho=65$)."
2101.04215,Multimodal Engagement Analysis from Facial Videos in the Classroom,"Student engagement is a key construct for learning and teaching. While most of the literature explored the student engagement analysis on computer-based settings, this paper extends that focus to classroom instruction. To best examine student visual engagement in the classroom, we conducted a study utilizing the audiovisual recordings of classes at a secondary school over one and a half month's time, acquired continuous engagement labeling per student (N=15) in repeated sessions, and explored computer vision methods to classify engagement levels from faces in the classroom. We trained deep embeddings for attentional and emotional features, training Attention-Net for head pose estimation and Affect-Net for facial expression recognition. We additionally trained different engagement classifiers, consisting of Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory, for both features. The best performing engagement classifiers achieved AUCs of .620 and .720 in Grades 8 and 12, respectively. We further investigated fusion strategies and found score-level fusion either improves the engagement classifiers or is on par with the best performing modality. We also investigated the effect of personalization and found that using only 60-seconds of person-specific data selected by margin uncertainty of the base classifier yielded an average AUC improvement of .084. 4.Our main aim with this work is to provide the technical means to facilitate the manual data analysis of classroom videos in research on teaching quality and in the context of teacher training."
2101.04281,Temporally Guided Articulated Hand Pose Tracking in Surgical Videos,"Articulated hand pose tracking is an under-explored problem that carries the potential for use in an extensive number of applications, especially in the medical domain. With a robust and accurate tracking system on surgical videos, the motion dynamics and movement patterns of the hands can be captured and analyzed for many rich tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hand pose estimation model, CondPose, which improves detection and tracking accuracy by incorporating a pose prior into its prediction. We show improvements over state-of-the-art methods which provide frame-wise independent predictions, by following a temporally guided approach that effectively leverages past predictions. We collect Surgical Hands, the first dataset that provides multi-instance articulated hand pose annotations for videos. Our dataset provides over 8.1k annotated hand poses from publicly available surgical videos and bounding boxes, pose annotations, and tracking IDs to enable multi-instance tracking. When evaluated on Surgical Hands, we show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach using mean Average Precision (mAP), to measure pose estimation accuracy, and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), to assess pose tracking performance. In comparison to a frame-wise independent strategy, we show greater performance in detecting and tracking hand poses and more substantial impact on localization accuracy. This has positive implications in generating more accurate representations of hands in the scene to be used for targeted downstream tasks."
2101.04929,Supervised deep learning of elastic SRV distances on the shape space of   curves,"Motivated by applications from computer vision to bioinformatics, the field of shape analysis deals with problems where one wants to analyze geometric objects, such as curves, while ignoring actions that preserve their shape, such as translations, rotations, or reparametrizations. Mathematical tools have been developed to define notions of distances, averages, and optimal deformations for geometric objects. One such framework, which has proven to be successful in many applications, is based on the square root velocity (SRV) transform, which allows one to define a computable distance between spatial curves regardless of how they are parametrized. This paper introduces a supervised deep learning framework for the direct computation of SRV distances between curves, which usually requires an optimization over the group of reparametrizations that act on the curves. The benefits of our approach in terms of computational speed and accuracy are illustrated via several numerical experiments."
2101.05687,Towards Accurate Camouflaged Object Detection with Mixture Convolution   and Interactive Fusion,"Camouflaged object detection (COD), which aims to identify the objects that conceal themselves into the surroundings, has recently drawn increasing research efforts in the field of computer vision. In practice, the success of deep learning based COD is mainly determined by two key factors, including (i) A significantly large receptive field, which provides rich context information, and (ii) An effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich multi-level features for accurate COD. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based COD approach, which integrates the large receptive field and effective feature fusion into a unified framework. Specifically, we first extract multi-level features from a backbone network. The resulting features are then fed to the proposed dual-branch mixture convolution modules, each of which utilizes multiple asymmetric convolutional layers and two dilated convolutional layers to extract rich context features from a large receptive field. Finally, we fuse the features using specially-designed multilevel interactive fusion modules, each of which employs an attention mechanism along with feature interaction for effective feature fusion. Our method detects camouflaged objects with an effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich context information from a large receptive field. All of these designs meet the requirements of COD well, allowing the accurate detection of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of accurately detecting camouflaged objects and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
2101.06085,Deep Dual-resolution Networks for Real-time and Accurate Semantic   Segmentation of Road Scenes,"Semantic segmentation is a key technology for autonomous vehicles to understand the surrounding scenes. The appealing performances of contemporary models usually come at the expense of heavy computations and lengthy inference time, which is intolerable for self-driving. Using light-weight architectures (encoder-decoder or two-pathway) or reasoning on low-resolution images, recent methods realize very fast scene parsing, even running at more than 100 FPS on a single 1080Ti GPU. However, there is still a significant gap in performance between these real-time methods and the models based on dilation backbones. To tackle this problem, we proposed a family of efficient backbones specially designed for real-time semantic segmentation. The proposed deep dual-resolution networks (DDRNets) are composed of two deep branches between which multiple bilateral fusions are performed. Additionally, we design a new contextual information extractor named Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) to enlarge effective receptive fields and fuse multi-scale context based on low-resolution feature maps. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed on both Cityscapes and CamVid dataset. In particular, on a single 2080Ti GPU, DDRNet-23-slim yields 77.4% mIoU at 102 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 74.7% mIoU at 230 FPS on CamVid test set. With widely used test augmentation, our method is superior to most state-of-the-art models and requires much less computation. Codes and trained models are available online."
2101.09154,Virtual laser scanning with HELIOS++: A novel take on ray tracing-based   simulation of topographic 3D laser scanning,"Topographic laser scanning is a remote sensing method to create detailed 3D point cloud representations of the Earth's surface. Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are available: i) a model of 3D scene and scanner, ii) a model of the beam-scene interaction, simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level, and iii) an application for which simulated data is fit for use. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Unique features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create full-waveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. As generation and analysis of waveforms can strongly impact runtimes, the user may set the level of detail for the subsampling, or optionally disable full-waveform output altogether. A detailed assessment of computational considerations and a comparison of HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, reveal reduced runtimes by up to 83 %. At the same time, memory requirements are reduced by up to 94 %, allowing for much larger (i.e. more complex) 3D scenes to be loaded into memory and hence to be virtually acquired by laser scanning simulation."
2101.09193,Dense outlier detection and open-set recognition based on training with   noisy negative images,"Deep convolutional models often produce inadequate predictions for inputs foreign to the training distribution. Consequently, the problem of detecting outlier images has recently been receiving a lot of attention. Unlike most previous work, we address this problem in the dense prediction context in order to be able to locate outlier objects in front of in-distribution background. Our approach is based on two reasonable assumptions. First, we assume that the inlier dataset is related to some narrow application field (e.g.~road driving). Second, we assume that there exists a general-purpose dataset which is much more diverse than the inlier dataset (e.g.~ImageNet-1k). We consider pixels from the general-purpose dataset as noisy negative training samples since most (but not all) of them are outliers. We encourage the model to recognize borders between known and unknown by pasting jittered negative patches over inlier training images. Our experiments target two dense open-set recognition benchmarks (WildDash 1 and Fishyscapes) and one dense open-set recognition dataset (StreetHazard). Extensive performance evaluation indicates competitive potential of the proposed approach."
2101.09858,Weakly Supervised Learning for Facial Behavior Analysis : A Review,"In the recent years, there has been a shift in facial behavior analysis from the laboratory-controlled conditions to the challenging in-the-wild conditions due to the superior performance of deep learning based approaches for many real world applications.However, the performance of deep learning approaches relies on the amount of training data. One of the major problems with data acquisition is the requirement of annotations for large amount of training data. Labeling process of huge training data demands lot of human support with strong domain expertise for facial expressions or action units, which is difficult to obtain in real-time environments.Moreover, labeling process is highly vulnerable to ambiguity of expressions or action units, especially for intensities due to the bias induced by the domain experts. Therefore, there is an imperative need to address the problem of facial behavior analysis with weak annotations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches for facial behavior analysis with both categorical as well as dimensional labels along with the challenges and potential research directions associated with it. First, we introduce various types of weak annotations in the context of facial behavior analysis and the corresponding challenges associated with it. We then systematically review the existing state-of-the-art approaches and provide a taxonomy of these approaches along with their insights and limitations. In addition, widely used data-sets in the reviewed literature and the performance of these approaches along with evaluation principles are summarized. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and opportunities along with the potential research directions in order to apply facial behavior analysis with weak labels in real life situations."
2101.10452,Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Monocular Depth Estimation Using   Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization,"This paper proposes an adversarial attack method to deep neural networks (DNNs) for monocular depth estimation, i.e., estimating the depth from a single image. Single image depth estimation has improved drastically in recent years due to the development of DNNs. However, vulnerabilities of DNNs for image classification have been revealed by adversarial attacks, and DNNs for monocular depth estimation could contain similar vulnerabilities. Therefore, research on vulnerabilities of DNNs for monocular depth estimation has spread rapidly, but many of them assume white-box conditions where inside information of DNNs is available, or are transferability-based black-box attacks that require a substitute DNN model and a training dataset. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, the proposed method in this paper analyzes DNNs under the black-box condition where only output depth maps are available. In addition, the proposed method does not require a substitute DNN that has a similar architecture to the target DNN nor any knowledge about training data used to train the target model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method succeeded in attacking two DNN-based methods that were trained with indoor and outdoor scenes respectively."
2101.10696,AINet+: Advancing Superpixel Segmentation via Cascaded Association   Implantation,"Superpixel segmentation has seen significant progress benefiting from the deep convolutional networks. The typical approach entails initial division of the image into grids, followed by a learning process that assigns each pixel to adjacent grid segments. However, reliance on convolutions with confined receptive fields results in an implicit, rather than explicit, understanding of pixel-grid interactions. This limitation often leads to a deficit of contextual information during the mapping of associations. To counteract this, we introduce the Association Implantation (AI) module, designed to allow networks to explicitly engage with pixel-grid relationships. This module embeds grid features directly into the vicinity of the central pixel and employs convolutional operations on an enlarged window, facilitating an adaptive transfer of knowledge. This approach enables the network to explicitly extract context at the pixel-grid level, which is more aligned with the objectives of superpixel segmentation than mere pixel-wise interactions. By integrating the AI module across various layers, we enable a progressive refinement of pixel-superpixel relationships from coarse to fine. To further enhance the assignment of boundary pixels, we've engineered a boundary-aware loss function. This function aids in the discrimination of boundary-adjacent pixels at the feature level, thereby empowering subsequent modules to precisely identify boundary pixels and enhance overall boundary accuracy. Our method has been rigorously tested on four benchmarks, including BSDS500, NYUv2, ACDC, and ISIC2017, and our model can achieve competitive performance with comparison methods."
2101.10785,Developing emotion recognition for video conference software to support   people with autism,"We develop an emotion recognition software for the use with a video conference software for autistic individuals which are unable to recognize emotions properly. It can get an image out of the video stream, detect the emotion in it with the help of a neural network and display the prediction to the user. The network is trained on facial landmark features. The software is fully modular to support adaption to different video conference software, programming languages and implementations."
2101.11896,Self-supervised Cross-silo Federated Neural Architecture Search,"Federated Learning (FL) provides both model performance and data privacy for machine learning tasks where samples or features are distributed among different parties. In the training process of FL, no party has a global view of data distributions or model architectures of other parties. Thus the manually-designed architectures may not be optimal. In the past, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to FL to address this critical issue. However, existing Federated NAS approaches require prohibitive communication and computation effort, as well as the availability of high-quality labels. In this work, we present Self-supervised Vertical Federated Neural Architecture Search (SS-VFNAS) for automating FL where participants hold feature-partitioned data, a common cross-silo scenario called Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). In the proposed framework, each party first conducts NAS using self-supervised approach to find a local optimal architecture with its own data. Then, parties collaboratively improve the local optimal architecture in a VFL framework with supervision. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach has superior performance, communication efficiency and privacy compared to Federated NAS and is capable of generating high-performance and highly-transferable heterogeneous architectures even with insufficient overlapping samples, providing automation for those parties without deep learning expertise."
2101.12254,Reliable COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-ray Images,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity."
2102.00369,Spectral Roll-off Points Variations: Exploring Useful Information in   Feature Maps by Its Variations,"Useful information (UI) is an elusive concept in neural networks. A quantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be recognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps decreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training due to lower Nyquist frequency. Inspired by the low-Nyqusit-frequency nature of UI, we propose the use of spectral roll-off points (SROPs) to estimate UI on variations. The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D image by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP statistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information estimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI variations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and training stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in various randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP variations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes the explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain knowledge."
2102.00487,Nonlinear Evolutionary PDE-Based Refinement of Optical Flow,"The goal of this paper is to propose two nonlinear variational models for obtaining a refined motion estimation from an image sequence. Both the proposed models can be considered as a part of a generalized framework for an accurate estimation of physics-based flow fields such as rotational and fluid flow. The first model is novel in the sense that it is divided into two phases: the first phase obtains a crude estimate of the optical flow and then the second phase refines this estimate using additional constraints. The correctness of this model is proved using an evolutionary PDE approach. The second model achieves the same refinement as the first model, but in a standard manner, using a single functional. A special feature of our models is that they permit us to provide efficient numerical implementations through the first-order primal-dual Chambolle-Pock scheme. Both the models are compared in the context of accurate estimation of angle by performing an anisotropic regularization of the divergence and curl of the flow respectively. We observe that, although both the models obtain the same level of accuracy, the two-phase model is more efficient. In fact, we empirically demonstrate that the single-phase and the two-phase models have convergence rates of order $O(1/N^2)$ and $O(1/N)$ respectively."
2102.00632,ConvNets for Counting: Object Detection of Transient Phenomena in   Steelpan Drums,"We train an object detector built from convolutional neural networks to count interference fringes in elliptical antinode regions in frames of high-speed video recordings of transient oscillations in Caribbean steelpan drums illuminated by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI). The annotations provided by our model aim to contribute to the understanding of time-dependent behavior in such drums by tracking the development of sympathetic vibration modes. The system is trained on a dataset of crowdsourced human-annotated images obtained from the Zooniverse Steelpan Vibrations Project. Due to the small number of human-annotated images and the ambiguity of the annotation task, we also evaluate the model on a large corpus of synthetic images whose properties have been matched to the real images by style transfer using a Generative Adversarial Network. Applying the model to thousands of unlabeled video frames, we measure oscillations consistent with audio recordings of these drum strikes. One unanticipated result is that sympathetic oscillations of higher-octave notes significantly precede the rise in sound intensity of the corresponding second harmonic tones; the mechanism responsible for this remains unidentified. This paper primarily concerns the development of the predictive model; further exploration of the steelpan images and deeper physical insights await its further application."
2102.04615,Benford's law: what does it say on adversarial images?,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fragile to small perturbations in the input images. These networks are thus prone to malicious attacks that perturb the inputs to force a misclassification. Such slightly manipulated images aimed at deceiving the classifier are known as adversarial images. In this work, we investigate statistical differences between natural images and adversarial ones. More precisely, we show that employing a proper image transformation and for a class of adversarial attacks, the distribution of the leading digit of the pixels in adversarial images deviates from Benford's law. The stronger the attack, the more distant the resulting distribution is from Benford's law. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of this new approach that can serve as a basis for alternative adversarial example detection methods that do not need to modify the original CNN classifier neither work on the raw high-dimensional pixels as features to defend against attacks."
2102.05984,Modeling 3D Surface Manifolds with a Locally Conditioned Atlas,"Recently proposed 3D object reconstruction methods represent a mesh with an atlas - a set of planar patches approximating the surface. However, their application in a real-world scenario is limited since the surfaces of reconstructed objects contain discontinuities, which degrades the quality of the final mesh. This is mainly caused by independent processing of individual patches, and in this work, we postulate to mitigate this limitation by preserving local consistency around patch vertices. To that end, we introduce a Locally Conditioned Atlas (LoCondA), a framework for representing a 3D object hierarchically in a generative model. Firstly, the model maps a point cloud of an object into a sphere. Secondly, by leveraging a spherical prior, we enforce the mapping to be locally consistent on the sphere and on the target object. This way, we can sample a mesh quad on that sphere and project it back onto the object's manifold. With LoCondA, we can produce topologically diverse objects while maintaining quads to be stitched together. We show that the proposed approach provides structurally coherent reconstructions while producing meshes of quality comparable to the competitors."
2102.06448,The MSR-Video to Text Dataset with Clean Annotations,"Video captioning automatically generates short descriptions of the video content, usually in form of a single sentence. Many methods have been proposed for solving this task. A large dataset called MSR Video to Text (MSR-VTT) is often used as the benchmark dataset for testing the performance of the methods. However, we found that the human annotations, i.e., the descriptions of video contents in the dataset are quite noisy, e.g., there are many duplicate captions and many captions contain grammatical problems. These problems may pose difficulties to video captioning models for learning underlying patterns. We cleaned the MSR-VTT annotations by removing these problems, then tested several typical video captioning models on the cleaned dataset. Experimental results showed that data cleaning boosted the performances of the models measured by popular quantitative metrics. We recruited subjects to evaluate the results of a model trained on the original and cleaned datasets. The human behavior experiment demonstrated that trained on the cleaned dataset, the model generated captions that were more coherent and more relevant to the contents of the video clips."
2102.06777,INSTA-YOLO: Real-Time Instance Segmentation,"Instance segmentation has gained recently huge attention in various computer vision applications. It aims at providing different IDs to different object of the scene, even if they belong to the same class. This is useful in various scenarios, especially in occlusions. Instance segmentation is usually performed as a two-stage pipeline. First, an object is detected, then semantic segmentation within the detected box area. This process involves costly up-sampling, especially for the segmentation part. Moreover, for some applications, such as LiDAR point clouds and aerial object detection, it is often required to predict oriented boxes, which add extra complexity to the two-stage pipeline. In this paper, we propose Insta-YOLO, a novel one-stage end-to-end deep learning model for real-time instance segmentation. The proposed model is inspired by the YOLO one-shot object detector, with the box regression loss is replaced with polynomial regression in the localization head. This modification enables us to skip the segmentation up-sampling decoder altogether and produces the instance segmentation contour from the polynomial output coefficients. In addition, this architecture is a natural fit for oriented objects. We evaluate our model on three datasets, namely, Carnva, Cityscapes and Airbus. The results show our model achieves competitive accuracy in terms of mAP with significant improvement in speed by 2x on GTX-1080 GPU."
2102.07708,Generating 3D structures from a 2D slice with GAN-based dimensionality   expansion,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be trained to generate 3D image data, which is useful for design optimisation. However, this conventionally requires 3D training data, which is challenging to obtain. 2D imaging techniques tend to be faster, higher resolution, better at phase identification and more widely available. Here, we introduce a generative adversarial network architecture, SliceGAN, which is able to synthesise high fidelity 3D datasets using a single representative 2D image. This is especially relevant for the task of material microstructure generation, as a cross-sectional micrograph can contain sufficient information to statistically reconstruct 3D samples. Our architecture implements the concept of uniform information density, which both ensures that generated volumes are equally high quality at all points in space, and that arbitrarily large volumes can be generated. SliceGAN has been successfully trained on a diverse set of materials, demonstrating the widespread applicability of this tool. The quality of generated micrographs is shown through a statistical comparison of synthetic and real datasets of a battery electrode in terms of key microstructural metrics. Finally, we find that the generation time for a $10^8$ voxel volume is on the order of a few seconds, yielding a path for future studies into high-throughput microstructural optimisation."
2102.09117,Spatio-Temporal Graph Dual-Attention Network for Multi-Agent Prediction   and Tracking,"An effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (e.g. autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called STG-DAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction involving heterogeneous agents. The system takes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction. The constraint not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. Moreover, the proposed prediction model can be easily adopted by multi-target tracking frameworks. The tracking accuracy proves to be improved by empirical results. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction and tracking accuracy."
2102.10274,Concealed Object Detection,"We present the first systematic study on concealed object detection (COD), which aims to identify objects that are ""perfectly"" embedded in their background. The high intrinsic similarities between the concealed objects and their background make COD far more challenging than traditional object detection/segmentation. To better understand this task, we collect a large-scale dataset, called COD10K, which consists of 10,000 images covering concealed objects in diverse real-world scenarios from 78 object categories. Further, we provide rich annotations including object categories, object boundaries, challenging attributes, object-level labels, and instance-level annotations. Our COD10K is the largest COD dataset to date, with the richest annotations, which enables comprehensive concealed object understanding and can even be used to help progress several other vision tasks, such as detection, segmentation, classification, etc. Motivated by how animals hunt in the wild, we also design a simple but strong baseline for COD, termed the Search Identification Network (SINet). Without any bells and whistles, SINet outperforms 12 cutting-edge baselines on all datasets tested, making them robust, general architectures that could serve as catalysts for future research in COD. Finally, we provide some interesting findings and highlight several potential applications and future directions. To spark research in this new field, our code, dataset, and online demo are available on our project page: http://mmcheng.net/cod."
2102.12145,GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator,"6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed. The code and models are available at https://github.com/shanice-l/gdrnpp_bop2022."
2102.12853,CausalX: Causal Explanations and Block Multilinear Factor Analysis,"By adhering to the dictum, ""No causation without manipulation (treatment, intervention)"", cause and effect data analysis represents changes in observed data in terms of changes in the causal factors. When causal factors are not amenable for active manipulation in the real world due to current technological limitations or ethical considerations, a counterfactual approach performs an intervention on the model of data formation. In the case of object representation or activity (temporal object) representation, varying object parts is generally unfeasible whether they be spatial and/or temporal. Multilinear algebra, the algebra of higher-order tensors, is a suitable and transparent framework for disentangling the causal factors of data formation. Learning a part-based intrinsic causal factor representations in a multilinear framework requires applying a set of interventions on a part-based multilinear model. We propose a unified multilinear model of wholes and parts. We derive a hierarchical block multilinear factorization, the M-mode Block SVD, that computes a disentangled representation of the causal factors by optimizing simultaneously across the entire object hierarchy. Given computational efficiency considerations, we introduce an incremental bottom-up computational alternative, the Incremental M-mode Block SVD, that employs the lower-level abstractions, the part representations, to represent the higher level of abstractions, the parent wholes. This incremental computational approach may also be employed to update the causal model parameters when data becomes available incrementally. The resulting object representation is an interpretable combinatorial choice of intrinsic causal factor representations related to an object's recursive hierarchy of wholes and parts that renders object recognition robust to occlusion and reduces training data requirements."
2102.13272,Accelerating Large Kernel Convolutions with Nested Winograd   Transformation.pdf,"Recent literature has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large kernels outperform vision transformers (ViTs) and CNNs with stacked small kernels in many computer vision tasks, such as object detection and image restoration. The Winograd transformation helps reduce the number of repetitive multiplications in convolution and is widely supported by many commercial AI processors. Researchers have proposed accelerating large kernel convolutions by linearly decomposing them into many small kernel convolutions and then sequentially accelerating each small kernel convolution with the Winograd algorithm. This work proposes a nested Winograd algorithm that iteratively decomposes a large kernel convolution into small kernel convolutions and proves it to be more effective than the linear decomposition Winograd transformation algorithm. Experiments show that compared to the linear decomposition Winograd algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the total number of multiplications by 1.4 to 10.5 times for computing 4x4 to 31x31 convolutions."
2103.00794,Early-Bird GCNs: Graph-Network Co-Optimization Towards More Efficient   GCN Training and Inference via Drawing Early-Bird Lottery Tickets,"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art deep learning model for representation learning on graphs. However, it remains notoriously challenging to train and inference GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because as the graph size grows, the sheer number of node features and the large adjacency matrix can easily explode the required memory and data movements. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we explore the possibility of drawing lottery tickets when sparsifying GCN graphs, i.e., subgraphs that largely shrink the adjacency matrix yet are capable of achieving accuracy comparable to or even better than their full graphs. Specifically, we for the first time discover the existence of graph early-bird (GEB) tickets that emerge at the very early stage when sparsifying GCN graphs, and propose a simple yet effective detector to automatically identify the emergence of such GEB tickets. Furthermore, we advocate graph-model co-optimization and develop a generic efficient GCN early-bird training framework dubbed GEBT that can significantly boost the efficiency of GCN training by (1) drawing joint early-bird tickets between the GCN graphs and models and (2) enabling simultaneously sparsification of both the GCN graphs and models. Experiments on various GCN models and datasets consistently validate our GEB finding and the effectiveness of our GEBT, e.g., our GEBT achieves up to 80.2% ~ 85.6% and 84.6% ~ 87.5% savings of GCN training and inference costs while offering a comparable or even better accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our source code and supplementary appendix are available at https://github.com/RICE-EIC/Early-Bird-GCN."
2103.00930,Unsupervised dynamic modeling of medical image transformation,"Spatiotemporal imaging has applications in e.g. cardiac diagnostics, surgical guidance, and radiotherapy monitoring, In this paper, we explain the temporal motion by identifying the underlying dynamics, only based on the sequential images. Our dynamical model maps the inputs of observed high-dimensional sequential images to a low-dimensional latent space wherein a linear relationship between a hidden state process and the lower-dimensional representation of the inputs holds. For this, we use a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to nonlinearly map the higher-dimensional image to a lower-dimensional space, wherein we model the dynamics with a linear Gaussian state-space model (LG-SSM). The model, a modified version of the Kalman variational auto-encoder, is end-to-end trainable, and the weights, both in the CVAE and LG-SSM, are simultaneously updated by maximizing the evidence lower bound of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to the original model, we explain the motion with a spatial transformation from one image to another. This results in sharper reconstructions and the possibility of transferring auxiliary information, such as segmentation, through the image sequence. Our experiments, on cardiac ultrasound time series, show that the dynamic model outperforms traditional image registration in execution time, to a similar performance. Further, our model offers the possibility to impute and extrapolate for missing samples."
2103.01272,Geometry-Based Grasping of Vine Tomatoes,"We propose a geometry-based grasping method for vine tomatoes. It relies on a computer-vision pipeline to identify the required geometric features of the tomatoes and of the truss stem. The grasping method then uses a geometric model of the robotic hand and the truss to determine a suitable grasping location on the stem. This approach allows for grasping tomato trusses without requiring delicate contact sensors or complex mechanistic models and under minimal risk of damaging the tomatoes. Lab experiments were conducted to validate the proposed methods, using an RGB-D camera and a low-cost robotic manipulator. The success rate was 83% to 92%, depending on the type of truss."
2103.01566,CG-CNN: Self-Supervised Feature Extraction Through Contextual Guidance   and Transfer Learning,"Contextually Guided Convolutional Neural Networks (CG-CNNs) employ self-supervision and contextual information to develop transferable features across diverse domains, including visual, tactile, temporal, and textual data. This work showcases the adaptability of CG-CNNs through applications to various datasets such as Caltech and Brodatz textures, the VibTac-12 tactile dataset, hyperspectral images, and challenges like the XOR problem and text analysis. In text analysis, CG-CNN employs an innovative embedding strategy that utilizes the context of neighboring words for classification, while in visual and signal data, it enhances feature extraction by exploiting spatial information. CG-CNN mimics the context-guided unsupervised learning mechanisms of biological neural networks and it can be trained to learn its features on limited-size datasets. Our experimental results on natural images reveal that CG-CNN outperforms comparable first-layer features of well-known deep networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet in terms of transferability and classification accuracy. In text analysis, CG-CNN learns word embeddings that outperform traditional models like Word2Vec in tasks such as the 20 Newsgroups text classification. Furthermore, ongoing development involves training CG-CNN on outputs from another CG-CNN to explore multi-layered architectures, aiming to construct more complex and descriptive features. This scalability and adaptability to various data types underscore the potential of CG-CNN to handle a wide range of applications, making it a promising architecture for tackling diverse data representation challenges."
2103.01648,Solving Inverse Problems by Joint Posterior Maximization with   Autoencoding Prior,"In this work we address the problem of solving ill-posed inverse problems in imaging where the prior is a variational autoencoder (VAE). Specifically we consider the decoupled case where the prior is trained once and can be reused for many different log-concave degradation models without retraining. Whereas previous MAP-based approaches to this problem lead to highly non-convex optimization algorithms, our approach computes the joint (space-latent) MAP that naturally leads to alternate optimization algorithms and to the use of a stochastic encoder to accelerate computations. The resulting technique (JPMAP) performs Joint Posterior Maximization using an Autoencoding Prior. We show theoretical and experimental evidence that the proposed objective function is quite close to bi-convex. Indeed it satisfies a weak bi-convexity property which is sufficient to guarantee that our optimization scheme converges to a stationary point. We also highlight the importance of correctly training the VAE using a denoising criterion, in order to ensure that the encoder generalizes well to out-of-distribution images, without affecting the quality of the generative model. This simple modification is key to providing robustness to the whole procedure. Finally we show how our joint MAP methodology relates to more common MAP approaches, and we propose a continuation scheme that makes use of our JPMAP algorithm to provide more robust MAP estimates. Experimental results also show the higher quality of the solutions obtained by our JPMAP approach with respect to other non-convex MAP approaches which more often get stuck in spurious local optima."
2103.01849,HED-UNet: Combined Segmentation and Edge Detection for Monitoring the   Antarctic Coastline,"Deep learning-based coastline detection algorithms have begun to outshine traditional statistical methods in recent years. However, they are usually trained only as single-purpose models to either segment land and water or delineate the coastline. In contrast to this, a human annotator will usually keep a mental map of both segmentation and delineation when performing manual coastline detection. To take into account this task duality, we therefore devise a new model to unite these two approaches in a deep learning model. By taking inspiration from the main building blocks of a semantic segmentation framework (UNet) and an edge detection framework (HED), both tasks are combined in a natural way. Training is made efficient by employing deep supervision on side predictions at multiple resolutions. Finally, a hierarchical attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively merge these multiscale predictions into the final model output. The advantages of this approach over other traditional and deep learning-based methods for coastline detection are demonstrated on a dataset of Sentinel-1 imagery covering parts of the Antarctic coast, where coastline detection is notoriously difficult. An implementation of our method is available at \url{https://github.com/khdlr/HED-UNet}."
2103.02465,Arthroscopic Multi-Spectral Scene Segmentation Using Deep Learning,"Knee arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedure which is performed to treat knee-joint ailment. Lack of visual information of the surgical site obtained from miniaturized cameras make this surgical procedure more complex. Knee cavity is a very confined space; therefore, surgical scenes are captured at close proximity. Insignificant context of knee atlas often makes them unrecognizable as a consequence unintentional tissue damage often occurred and shows a long learning curve to train new surgeons. Automatic context awareness through labeling of the surgical site can be an alternative to mitigate these drawbacks. However, from the previous studies, it is confirmed that the surgical site exhibits several limitations, among others, lack of discriminative contextual information such as texture and features which drastically limits this vision task. Additionally, poor imaging conditions and lack of accurate ground-truth labels are also limiting the accuracy. To mitigate these limitations of knee arthroscopy, in this work we proposed a scene segmentation method that successfully segments multi structures."
2103.02997,MOGAN: Morphologic-structure-aware Generative Learning from a Single   Image,"In most interactive image generation tasks, given regions of interest (ROI) by users, the generated results are expected to have adequate diversities in appearance while maintaining correct and reasonable structures in original images. Such tasks become more challenging if only limited data is available. Recently proposed generative models complete training based on only one image. They pay much attention to the monolithic feature of the sample while ignoring the actual semantic information of different objects inside the sample. As a result, for ROI-based generation tasks, they may produce inappropriate samples with excessive randomicity and without maintaining the related objects' correct structures. To address this issue, this work introduces a MOrphologic-structure-aware Generative Adversarial Network named MOGAN that produces random samples with diverse appearances and reliable structures based on only one image. For training for ROI, we propose to utilize the data coming from the original image being augmented and bring in a novel module to transform such augmented data into knowledge containing both structures and appearances, thus enhancing the model's comprehension of the sample. To learn the rest areas other than ROI, we employ binary masks to ensure the generation isolated from ROI. Finally, we set parallel and hierarchical branches of the mentioned learning process. Compared with other single image GAN schemes, our approach focuses on internal features including the maintenance of rational structures and variation on appearance. Experiments confirm a better capacity of our model on ROI-based image generation tasks than its competitive peers."
2103.03636,CoDeGAN: Contrastive Disentanglement for Generative Adversarial Network,"Disentanglement, a critical concern in interpretable machine learning, has also garnered significant attention from the computer vision community. Many existing GAN-based class disentanglement (unsupervised) approaches, such as InfoGAN and its variants, primarily aim to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the generated image and its latent codes. However, this focus may lead to a tendency for the network to generate highly similar images when presented with the same latent class factor, potentially resulting in mode collapse or mode dropping. To alleviate this problem, we propose \texttt{CoDeGAN} (Contrastive Disentanglement for Generative Adversarial Networks), where we relax similarity constraints for disentanglement from the image domain to the feature domain. This modification not only enhances the stability of GAN training but also improves their disentangling capabilities. Moreover, we integrate self-supervised pre-training into CoDeGAN to learn semantic representations, significantly facilitating unsupervised disentanglement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/learninginvision/CoDeGAN."
2103.04192,High Perceptual Quality Image Denoising with a Posterior Sampling CGAN,"The vast work in Deep Learning (DL) has led to a leap in image denoising research. Most DL solutions for this task have chosen to put their efforts on the denoiser's architecture while maximizing distortion performance. However, distortion driven solutions lead to blurry results with sub-optimal perceptual quality, especially in immoderate noise levels. In this paper we propose a different perspective, aiming to produce sharp and visually pleasing denoised images that are still faithful to their clean sources. Formally, our goal is to achieve high perceptual quality with acceptable distortion. This is attained by a stochastic denoiser that samples from the posterior distribution, trained as a generator in the framework of conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN). Contrary to distortion-based regularization terms that conflict with perceptual quality, we introduce to the CGAN objective a theoretically founded penalty term that does not force a distortion requirement on individual samples, but rather on their mean. We showcase our proposed method with a novel denoiser architecture that achieves the reformed denoising goal and produces vivid and diverse outcomes in immoderate noise levels."
2103.04279,Hierarchical Self Attention Based Autoencoder for Open-Set Human   Activity Recognition,"Wearable sensor based human activity recognition is a challenging problem due to difficulty in modeling spatial and temporal dependencies of sensor signals. Recognition models in closed-set assumption are forced to yield members of known activity classes as prediction. However, activity recognition models can encounter an unseen activity due to body-worn sensor malfunction or disability of the subject performing the activities. This problem can be addressed through modeling solution according to the assumption of open-set recognition. Hence, the proposed self attention based approach combines data hierarchically from different sensor placements across time to classify closed-set activities and it obtains notable performance improvement over state-of-the-art models on five publicly available datasets. The decoder in this autoencoder architecture incorporates self-attention based feature representations from encoder to detect unseen activity classes in open-set recognition setting. Furthermore, attention maps generated by the hierarchical model demonstrate explainable selection of features in activity recognition. We conduct extensive leave one subject out validation experiments that indicate significantly improved robustness to noise and subject specific variability in body-worn sensor signals.

2103.04565,Improving Transformation-based Defenses against Adversarial Examples   with First-order Perturbations,"Deep neural networks have been successfully applied in various machine learning tasks. However, studies show that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. This exposes a potential threat to neural network-based intelligent systems. We observe that the probability of the correct result outputted by the neural network increases by applying small first-order perturbations generated for non-predicted class labels to adversarial examples. Based on this observation, we propose a method for counteracting adversarial perturbations to improve adversarial robustness. In the proposed method, we randomly select a number of class labels and generate small first-order perturbations for these selected labels. The generated perturbations are added together and then clamped onto a specified space. The obtained perturbation is finally added to the adversarial example to counteract the adversarial perturbation contained in the example. The proposed method is applied at inference time and does not require retraining or finetuning the model. We experimentally validate the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the defense performance of several transformation-based defense methods, especially against strong adversarial examples generated using more iterations."
2103.04715,Bayesian imaging using Plug & Play priors: when Langevin meets Tweedie,"Since the seminal work of Venkatakrishnan et al. in 2013, Plug & Play (PnP) methods have become ubiquitous in Bayesian imaging. These methods derive Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) or Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimators for inverse problems in imaging by combining an explicit likelihood function with a prior that is implicitly defined by an image denoising algorithm. The PnP algorithms proposed in the literature mainly differ in the iterative schemes they use for optimisation or for sampling. In the case of optimisation schemes, some recent works guarantee the convergence to a fixed point, albeit not necessarily a MAP estimate. In the case of sampling schemes, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known proof of convergence. There also remain important open questions regarding whether the underlying Bayesian models and estimators are well defined, well-posed, and have the basic regularity properties required to support these numerical schemes. To address these limitations, this paper develops theory, methods, and provably convergent algorithms for performing Bayesian inference with PnP priors. We introduce two algorithms: 1) PnP-ULA (Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm) for Monte Carlo sampling and MMSE inference; and 2) PnP-SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) for MAP inference. Using recent results on the quantitative convergence of Markov chains, we establish detailed convergence guarantees for these two algorithms under realistic assumptions on the denoising operators used, with special attention to denoisers based on deep neural networks. We also show that these algorithms approximately target a decision-theoretically optimal Bayesian model that is well-posed. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on several canonical problems such as image deblurring, inpainting, and denoising, where they are used for point estimation as well as for uncertainty visualisation and quantification."
2103.05423,Deep Learning Based 3D Segmentation: A Survey,"3D segmentation is a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving and robotics. It has received significant attention from the computer vision, graphics and machine learning communities. Conventional methods for 3D segmentation, based on hand-crafted features and machine learning classifiers, lack generalization ability. Driven by their success in 2D computer vision, deep learning techniques have recently become the tool of choice for 3D segmentation tasks. This has led to an influx of many methods in the literature that have been evaluated on different benchmark datasets. Whereas survey papers on RGB-D and point cloud segmentation exist, there is a lack of a recent in-depth survey that covers all 3D data modalities and application domains. This paper fills the gap and comprehensively surveys the recent progress in deep learning-based 3D segmentation techniques. We cover over 220 works from the last six years, analyze their strengths and limitations, and discuss their competitive results on benchmark datasets. The survey provides a summary of the most commonly used pipelines and finally highlights promising research directions for the future."
2103.07368,Information Maximization Clustering via Multi-View Self-Labelling,"Image clustering is a particularly challenging computer vision task, which aims to generate annotations without human supervision. Recent advances focus on the use of self-supervised learning strategies in image clustering, by first learning valuable semantics and then clustering the image representations. These multiple-phase algorithms, however, increase the computational time and their final performance is reliant on the first stage. By extending the self-supervised approach, we propose a novel single-phase clustering method that simultaneously learns meaningful representations and assigns the corresponding annotations. This is achieved by integrating a discrete representation into the self-supervised paradigm through a classifier net. Specifically, the proposed clustering objective employs mutual information, and maximizes the dependency between the integrated discrete representation and a discrete probability distribution. The discrete probability distribution is derived though the self-supervised process by comparing the learnt latent representation with a set of trainable prototypes. To enhance the learning performance of the classifier, we jointly apply the mutual information across multi-crop views. Our empirical results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with the average accuracy of 89.1% and 49.0%, respectively, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100/20 datasets. Finally, the proposed method also demonstrates attractive robustness to parameter settings, making it ready to be applicable to other datasets."
2103.08533,Lasry-Lions Envelopes and Nonconvex Optimization: A Homotopy Approach,"In large-scale optimization, the presence of nonsmooth and nonconvex terms in a given problem typically makes it hard to solve. A popular approach to address nonsmooth terms in convex optimization is to approximate them with their respective Moreau envelopes. In this work, we study the use of Lasry-Lions double envelopes to approximate nonsmooth terms that are also not convex. These envelopes are an extension of the Moreau ones but exhibit an additional smoothness property that makes them amenable to fast optimization algorithms. Lasry-Lions envelopes can also be seen as an ""intermediate"" between a given function and its convex envelope, and we make use of this property to develop a method that builds a sequence of approximate subproblems that are easier to solve than the original problem. We discuss convergence properties of this method when used to address composite minimization problems; additionally, based on a number of experiments, we discuss settings where it may be more useful than classical alternatives in two domains: signal decoding and spectral unmixing."
2103.09384,Triplet-Watershed for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Hyperspectral images (HSI) consist of rich spatial and spectral information, which can potentially be used for several applications. However, noise, band correlations and high dimensionality restrict the applicability of such data. This is recently addressed using creative deep learning network architectures such as ResNet, SSRN, and A2S2K. However, the last layer, i.e the classification layer, remains unchanged and is taken to be the softmax classifier. In this article, we propose to use a watershed classifier. Watershed classifier extends the watershed operator from Mathematical Morphology for classification. In its vanilla form, the watershed classifier does not have any trainable parameters. In this article, we propose a novel approach to train deep learning networks to obtain representations suitable for the watershed classifier. The watershed classifier exploits the connectivity patterns, a characteristic of HSI datasets, for better inference. We show that exploiting such characteristics allows the Triplet-Watershed to achieve state-of-art results in supervised and semi-supervised contexts. These results are validated on Indianpines (IP), University of Pavia (UP), Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and University of Houston (UH) datasets, relying on simple convnet architecture using a quarter of parameters compared to previous state-of-the-art networks. The source code for reproducing the experiments and supplementary material (high resolution images) is available at https://github.com/ac20/TripletWatershed Code."
2103.09962,DWDN: Deep Wiener Deconvolution Network for Non-Blind Image Deblurring,"We present a simple and effective approach for non-blind image deblurring, combining classical techniques and deep learning. In contrast to existing methods that deblur the image directly in the standard image space, we propose to perform an explicit deconvolution process in a feature space by integrating a classical Wiener deconvolution framework with learned deep features. A multi-scale cascaded feature refinement module then predicts the deblurred image from the deconvolved deep features, progressively recovering detail and small-scale structures. The proposed model is trained in an end-to-end manner and evaluated on scenarios with simulated Gaussian noise, saturated pixels, or JPEG compression artifacts as well as real-world images. Moreover, we present detailed analyses of the benefit of the feature-based Wiener deconvolution and of the multi-scale cascaded feature refinement as well as the robustness of the proposed approach. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed deep Wiener deconvolution network facilitates deblurred results with visibly fewer artifacts and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art non-blind image deblurring methods by a wide margin."
2103.10702,ClawCraneNet: Leveraging Object-level Relation for Text-based Video   Segmentation,"Text-based video segmentation is a challenging task that segments out the natural language referred objects in videos. It essentially requires semantic comprehension and fine-grained video understanding. Existing methods introduce language representation into segmentation models in a bottom-up manner, which merely conducts vision-language interaction within local receptive fields of ConvNets. We argue that such interaction is not fulfilled since the model can barely construct region-level relationships given partial observations, which is contrary to the description logic of natural language/referring expressions. In fact, people usually describe a target object using relations with other objects, which may not be easily understood without seeing the whole video. To address the issue, we introduce a novel top-down approach by imitating how we human segment an object with the language guidance. We first figure out all candidate objects in videos and then choose the refereed one by parsing relations among those high-level objects. Three kinds of object-level relations are investigated for precise relationship understanding, i.e., positional relation, text-guided semantic relation, and temporal relation. Extensive experiments on A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Qualitative results also show our results are more explainable."
2103.12417,OFFSEG: A Semantic Segmentation Framework For Off-Road Driving,"Off-road image semantic segmentation is challenging due to the presence of uneven terrains, unstructured class boundaries, irregular features and strong textures. These aspects affect the perception of the vehicle from which the information is used for path planning. Current off-road datasets exhibit difficulties like class imbalance and understanding of varying environmental topography. To overcome these issues we propose a framework for off-road semantic segmentation called as OFFSEG that involves (i) a pooled class semantic segmentation with four classes (sky, traversable region, non-traversable region and obstacle) using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (ii) a colour segmentation methodology to segment out specific sub-classes (grass, puddle, dirt, gravel, etc.) from the traversable region for better scene understanding. The evaluation of the framework is carried out on two off-road driving datasets, namely, RELLIS-3D and RUGD. We have also tested proposed framework in IISERB campus frames. The results show that OFFSEG achieves good performance and also provides detailed information on the traversable region."
2103.13922,ScanGAN360: A Generative Model of Realistic Scanpaths for 360$^{\circ}$   Images,"Understanding and modeling the dynamics of human gaze behavior in 360$^\circ$ environments is a key challenge in computer vision and virtual reality. Generative adversarial approaches could alleviate this challenge by generating a large number of possible scanpaths for unseen images. Existing methods for scanpath generation, however, do not adequately predict realistic scanpaths for 360$^\circ$ images. We present ScanGAN360, a new generative adversarial approach to address this challenging problem. Our network generator is tailored to the specifics of 360$^\circ$ images representing immersive environments. Specifically, we accomplish this by leveraging the use of a spherical adaptation of dynamic-time warping as a loss function and proposing a novel parameterization of 360$^\circ$ scanpaths. The quality of our scanpaths outperforms competing approaches by a large margin and is almost on par with the human baseline. ScanGAN360 thus allows fast simulation of large numbers of virtual observers, whose behavior mimics real users, enabling a better understanding of gaze behavior and novel applications in virtual scene design."
2103.14249,Marine Snow Removal Benchmarking Dataset,"This paper introduces a new benchmarking dataset for marine snow removal of underwater images. Marine snow is one of the main degradation sources of underwater images that are caused by small particles, e.g., organic matter and sand, between the underwater scene and photosensors. We mathematically model two typical types of marine snow from the observations of real underwater images. The modeled artifacts are synthesized with underwater images to construct large-scale pairs of ground truth and degraded images to calculate objective qualities for marine snow removal and to train a deep neural network. We propose two marine snow removal tasks using the dataset and show the first benchmarking results of marine snow removal. The Marine Snow Removal Benchmarking Dataset is publicly available online."
2103.14872,Deep Learning Techniques for In-Crop Weed Identification: A Review,"Weeds are a significant threat to the agricultural productivity and the environment. The increasing demand for sustainable agriculture has driven innovations in accurate weed control technologies aimed at reducing the reliance on herbicides. With the great success of deep learning in various vision tasks, many promising image-based weed detection algorithms have been developed. This paper reviews recent developments of deep learning techniques in the field of image-based weed detection. The review begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of deep learning related to weed detection. Next, recent progresses on deep weed detection are reviewed with the discussion of the research materials including public weed datasets. Finally, the challenges of developing practically deployable weed detection methods are summarized, together with the discussions of the opportunities for future research.We hope that this review will provide a timely survey of the field and attract more researchers to address this inter-disciplinary research problem."
2103.15114,Explaining Representation by Mutual Information,"As interpretability gains attention in machine learning, there is a growing need for reliable models that fully explain representation content. We propose a mutual information (MI)-based method that decomposes neural network representations into three exhaustive components: total mutual information, decision-related information, and redundant information. This theoretically complete framework captures the entire input-representation relationship, surpassing partial explanations like those from Grad-CAM. Using two lightweight modules integrated into architectures such as CNNs and Transformers,we estimate these components and demonstrate their interpretive power through visualizations on ResNet and prototype network applied to image classification and few-shot learning tasks. Our approach is distinguished by three key features: 1. Rooted in mutual information theory, it delivers a thorough and theoretically grounded interpretation, surpassing the scope of existing interpretability methods. 2. Unlike conventional methods that focus on explaining decisions, our approach centers on interpreting representations. 3. It seamlessly integrates into pre-existing network architectures, requiring only fine-tuning of the inserted modules."
2103.15812,LatentKeypointGAN: Controlling Images via Latent Keypoints,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have attained photo-realistic quality in image generation. However, how to best control the image content remains an open challenge. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN which is trained end-to-end on the classical GAN objective with internal conditioning on a set of space keypoints. These keypoints have associated appearance embeddings that respectively control the position and style of the generated objects and their parts. A major difficulty that we address with suitable network architectures and training schemes is disentangling the image into spatial and appearance factors without domain knowledge and supervision signals. We demonstrate that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging keypoint embeddings, such as generating portraits by combining the eyes, nose, and mouth from different images. In addition, the explicit generation of keypoints and matching images enables a new, GAN-based method for unsupervised keypoint detection."
2103.16074,PointBA: Towards Backdoor Attacks in 3D Point Cloud,"3D deep learning has been increasingly more popular for a variety of tasks including many safety-critical applications. However, recently several works raise the security issues of 3D deep models. Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep models."
2103.17271,DCVNet: Dilated Cost Volume Networks for Fast Optical Flow,"The cost volume, capturing the similarity of possible correspondences across two input images, is a key ingredient in state-of-the-art optical flow approaches. When sampling correspondences to build the cost volume, a large neighborhood radius is required to deal with large displacements, introducing a significant computational burden. To address this, coarse-to-fine or recurrent processing of the cost volume is usually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a small radius suffices. In this paper, we propose an alternative by constructing cost volumes with different dilation factors to capture small and large displacements simultaneously. A U-Net with skip connections is employed to convert the dilated cost volumes into interpolation weights between all possible captured displacements to get the optical flow. Our proposed model DCVNet only needs to process the cost volume once in a simple feedforward manner and does not rely on the sequential processing strategy. DCVNet obtains comparable accuracy to existing approaches and achieves real-time inference (30 fps on a mid-end 1080ti GPU). The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/neu-vi/ezflow."
2104.00170,Are Bias Mitigation Techniques for Deep Learning Effective?,"A critical problem in deep learning is that systems learn inappropriate biases, resulting in their inability to perform well on minority groups. This has led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias. However, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study protocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test many forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned specifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved evaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to ask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and hyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets. We introduce a new dataset called Biased MNIST that enables assessment of robustness to multiple bias sources. We use Biased MNIST and a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning to the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning distributions, which is critical because for many applications the test distribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms exploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are highly sensitive to the choice of tuning set. Based on our findings, we implore the community to adopt more rigorous assessment of future bias mitigation methods. All data, code, and results are publicly available at: https://github.com/erobic/bias-mitigators."
2104.00921,AAformer: Auto-Aligned Transformer for Person Re-Identification,"In person re-identification (re-ID), extracting part-level features from person images has been verified to be crucial to offer fine-grained information. Most of the existing CNN-based methods only locate the human parts coarsely, or rely on pretrained human parsing models and fail in locating the identifiable nonhuman parts (e.g., knapsack). In this article, we introduce an alignment scheme in transformer architecture for the first time and propose the auto-aligned transformer (AAformer) to automatically locate both the human parts and nonhuman ones at patch level. We introduce the ""Part tokens ([PART]s)"", which are learnable vectors, to extract part features in the transformer. A [PART] only interacts with a local subset of patches in self-attention and learns to be the part representation. To adaptively group the image patches into different subsets, we design the auto-alignment. Auto-alignment employs a fast variant of optimal transport (OT) algorithm to online cluster the patch embeddings into several groups with the [PART]s as their prototypes. AAformer integrates the part alignment into the self-attention and the output [PART]s can be directly used as part features for retrieval. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of [PART]s and the superiority of AAformer over various state-of-the-art methods."
2104.00947,A Detector-oblivious Multi-arm Network for Keypoint Matching,"This paper presents a matching network to establish point correspondence between images. We propose a Multi-Arm Network (MAN) to learn region overlap and depth, which can greatly improve the keypoint matching robustness while bringing little computational cost during the inference stage. Another design that makes this framework different from many existing learning based pipelines that require re-training when a different keypoint detector is adopted, our network can directly work with different keypoint detectors without such a time-consuming re-training process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on outdoor and indoor datasets demonstrated that our proposed MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2104.01431,Aggregated Contextual Transformations for High-Resolution Image   Inpainting,"State-of-the-art image inpainting approaches can suffer from generating distorted structures and blurry textures in high-resolution images (e.g., 512x512). The challenges mainly drive from (1) image content reasoning from distant contexts, and (2) fine-grained texture synthesis for a large missing region. To overcome these two challenges, we propose an enhanced GAN-based model, named Aggregated COntextual-Transformation GAN (AOT-GAN), for high-resolution image inpainting. Specifically, to enhance context reasoning, we construct the generator of AOT-GAN by stacking multiple layers of a proposed AOT block. The AOT blocks aggregate contextual transformations from various receptive fields, allowing to capture both informative distant image contexts and rich patterns of interest for context reasoning. For improving texture synthesis, we enhance the discriminator of AOT-GAN by training it with a tailored mask-prediction task. Such a training objective forces the discriminator to distinguish the detailed appearances of real and synthesized patches, and in turn, facilitates the generator to synthesize clear textures. Extensive comparisons on Places2, the most challenging benchmark with 1.8 million high-resolution images of 365 complex scenes, show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin in terms of FID with 38.60% relative improvement. A user study including more than 30 subjects further validates the superiority of AOT-GAN. We further evaluate the proposed AOT-GAN in practical applications, e.g., logo removal, face editing, and object removal. Results show that our model achieves promising completions in the real world. We release code and models in https://github.com/researchmm/AOT-GAN-for-Inpainting."
2104.02206,Tuned Compositional Feature Replays for Efficient Stream Learning,"Our brains extract durable, generalizable knowledge from transient experiences of the world. Artificial neural networks come nowhere close to this ability. When tasked with learning to classify objects by training on non-repeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, Compositional Replay Using Memory Blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature maps reconstructed by combining generic parts. CRUMB concatenates trainable and re-usable ""memory block"" vectors to compositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks. Storing the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli enables memories of the stimuli to be replayed during later tasks. This reconstruction mechanism also primes the neural network to minimize catastrophic forgetting by biasing it towards attending to information about object shapes more than information about image textures, and stabilizes the network during stream learning by providing a shared feature-level basis for all training examples. These properties allow CRUMB to outperform an otherwise identical algorithm that stores and replays raw images, while occupying only 3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on 7 challenging datasets. To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we introduce 2 new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning. With only 3.7-4.1% as much memory and 15-43% as much runtime, CRUMB mitigates catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/MorganBDT/crumb.git."
2104.02857,Soft-Label Anonymous Gastric X-ray Image Distillation,"This paper presents a soft-label anonymous gastric X-ray image distillation method based on a gradient descent approach. The sharing of medical data is demanded to construct high-accuracy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. However, the large size of the medical dataset and privacy protection are remaining problems in medical data sharing, which hindered the research of CAD systems. The idea of our distillation method is to extract the valid information of the medical dataset and generate a tiny distilled dataset that has a different data distribution. Different from model distillation, our method aims to find the optimal distilled images, distilled labels and the optimized learning rate. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only effectively compress the medical dataset but also anonymize medical images to protect the patient's private information. The proposed approach can improve the efficiency and security of medical data sharing."
2104.03361,Monitoring Social-distance in Wide Areas during Pandemics: a Density Map   and Segmentation Approach,"With the relaxation of the containment measurements around the globe, monitoring the social distancing in crowded public places is of grate importance to prevent a new massive wave of COVID-19 infections. Recent works in that matter have limited themselves by detecting social distancing in corridors up to small crowds by detecting each person individually considering the full body in the image. In this work, we propose a new framework for monitoring the social-distance using end-to-end Deep Learning, to detect crowds violating the social-distance in wide areas where important occlusions may be present. Our framework consists in the creation of a new ground truth based on the ground truth density maps and the proposal of two different solutions, a density-map-based and a segmentation-based, to detect the crowds violating the social-distance constrain. We assess the results of both approaches by using the generated ground truth from the PET2009 and CityStreet datasets. We show that our framework performs well at providing the zones where people are not following the social-distance even when heavily occluded or far away from one camera."
2104.03893,Multimodal Fusion of EMG and Vision for Human Grasp Intent Inference in   Prosthetic Hand Control,"Objective: For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the capability to perform daily living activities. Current control methods based on physiological signals such as electromyography (EMG) are prone to yielding poor inference outcomes due to motion artifacts, muscle fatigue, and many more. Vision sensors are a major source of information about the environment state and can play a vital role in inferring feasible and intended gestures. However, visual evidence is also susceptible to its own artifacts, most often due to object occlusion, lighting changes, etc. Multimodal evidence fusion using physiological and vision sensor measurements is a natural approach due to the complementary strengths of these modalities. Methods: In this paper, we present a Bayesian evidence fusion framework for grasp intent inference using eye-view video, eye-gaze, and EMG from the forearm processed by neural network models. We analyze individual and fused performance as a function of time as the hand approaches the object to grasp it. For this purpose, we have also developed novel data processing and augmentation techniques to train neural network components. Results: Our results indicate that, on average, fusion improves the instantaneous upcoming grasp type classification accuracy while in the reaching phase by 13.66% and 14.8%, relative to EMG (81.64% non-fused) and visual evidence (80.5% non-fused) individually, resulting in an overall fusion accuracy of 95.3%. Conclusion: Our experimental data analyses demonstrate that EMG and visual evidence show complementary strengths, and as a consequence, fusion of multimodal evidence can outperform each individual evidence modality at any given time."
2104.04310,Context-self contrastive pretraining for crop type semantic segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a fully supervised pre-training scheme based on contrastive learning particularly tailored to dense classification tasks. The proposed Context-Self Contrastive Loss (CSCL) learns an embedding space that makes semantic boundaries pop-up by use of a similarity metric between every location in a training sample and its local context. For crop type semantic segmentation from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) we find performance at parcel boundaries to be a critical bottleneck and explain how CSCL tackles the underlying cause of that problem, improving the state-of-the-art performance in this task. Additionally, using images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite missions we compile the largest, to our knowledge, SITS dataset densely annotated by crop type and parcel identities, which we make publicly available together with the data generation pipeline. Using that data we find CSCL, even with minimal pre-training, to improve all respective baselines and present a process for semantic segmentation at super-resolution for obtaining crop classes at a more granular level. The code and instructions to download the data can be found in https://github.com/michaeltrs/DeepSatModels."
2104.04785,Generating Physically-Consistent Satellite Imagery for Climate   Visualizations,"Deep generative vision models are now able to synthesize realistic-looking satellite imagery. But, the possibility of hallucinations prevents their adoption for risk-sensitive applications, such as generating materials for communicating climate change. To demonstrate this issue, we train a generative adversarial network (pix2pixHD) to create synthetic satellite imagery of future flooding and reforestation events. We find that a pure deep learning-based model can generate photorealistic flood visualizations but hallucinates floods at locations that were not susceptible to flooding. To address this issue, we propose to condition and evaluate generative vision models on segmentation maps of physics-based flood models. We show that our physics-conditioned model outperforms the pure deep learning-based model and a handcrafted baseline. We evaluate the generalization capability of our method to different remote sensing data and different climate-related events (reforestation). We publish our code and dataset which includes the data for a third case study of melting Arctic sea ice and $>$30,000 labeled HD image triplets -- or the equivalent of 5.5 million images at 128x128 pixels -- for segmentation guided image-to-image translation in Earth observation. Code and data is available at \url{https://github.com/blutjens/eie-earth-public}."
2104.05031,Deformable Capsules for Object Detection,"Capsule networks promise significant benefits over convolutional networks by storing stronger internal representations, and routing information based on the agreement between intermediate representations' projections. Despite this, their success has been limited to small-scale classification datasets due to their computationally expensive nature. Though memory efficient, convolutional capsules impose geometric constraints that fundamentally limit the ability of capsules to model the pose/deformation of objects. Further, they do not address the bigger memory concern of class-capsules scaling up to bigger tasks such as detection or large-scale classification. In this study, we introduce a new family of capsule networks, deformable capsules (\textit{DeformCaps}), to address a very important problem in computer vision: object detection. We propose two new algorithms associated with our \textit{DeformCaps}: a novel capsule structure (\textit{SplitCaps}), and a novel dynamic routing algorithm (\textit{SE-Routing}), which balance computational efficiency with the need for modeling a large number of objects and classes, which have never been achieved with capsule networks before. We demonstrate that the proposed methods efficiently scale up to create the first-ever capsule network for object detection in the literature. Our proposed architecture is a one-stage detection framework and it obtains results on MS COCO which are on par with state-of-the-art one-stage CNN-based methods, while producing fewer false positive detection, generalizing to unusual poses/viewpoints of objects."
2104.05326,Unsupervised foreign object detection based on dual-energy   absorptiometry in the food industry,"X-ray imaging is a widely used technique for non-destructive inspection of agricultural food products. One application of X-ray imaging is the autonomous, in-line detection of foreign objects in food samples. Examples of such inclusions are bone fragments in meat products, plastic and metal debris in fish, fruit infestations. This article presents a processing methodology for unsupervised foreign object detection based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). A foreign object is defined as a fragment of material with different X-ray attenuation properties than those belonging to the food product. A novel thickness correction model is introduced as a pre-processing technique for DEXA data. The aim of the model is to homogenize regions in the image that belong to the food product and enhance contrast where the foreign object is present. In this way, the segmentation of the foreign object is more robust to noise and lack of contrast. The proposed methodology was applied to a dataset of 488 samples of meat products. The samples were acquired from a conveyor belt in a food processing factory. Approximately 60\% of the samples contain foreign objects of different types and sizes, while the rest of the samples are void of foreign objects. The results show that samples without foreign objects are correctly identified in 97% of cases, the overall accuracy of foreign object detection reaches 95%."
2104.05707,LocalViT: Analyzing Locality in Vision Transformers,"The aim of this paper is to study the influence of locality mechanisms in vision transformers. Transformers originated from machine translation and are particularly good at modelling long-range dependencies within a long sequence. Although the global interaction between the token embeddings could be well modelled by the self-attention mechanism of transformers, what is lacking is a locality mechanism for information exchange within a local region. In this paper, locality mechanism is systematically investigated by carefully designed controlled experiments. We add locality to vision transformers into the feed-forward network. This seemingly simple solution is inspired by the comparison between feed-forward networks and inverted residual blocks. The importance of locality mechanisms is validated in two ways: 1) A wide range of design choices (activation function, layer placement, expansion ratio) are available for incorporating locality mechanisms and proper choices can lead to a performance gain over the baseline, and 2) The same locality mechanism is successfully applied to vision transformers with different architecture designs, which shows the generalization of the locality concept. For ImageNet2012 classification, the locality-enhanced transformers outperform the baselines Swin-T, DeiT-T, and PVT-T by 1.0%, 2.6% and 3.1% with a negligible increase in the number of parameters and computational effort. Code is available at https://github.com/ofsoundof/LocalViT."
2104.06031,Global Transport for Fluid Reconstruction with Learned Self-Supervision,"We propose a novel method to reconstruct volumetric flows from sparse views via a global transport formulation. Instead of obtaining the space-time function of the observations, we reconstruct its motion based on a single initial state. In addition we introduce a learned self-supervision that constrains observations from unseen angles. These visual constraints are coupled via the transport constraints and a differentiable rendering step to arrive at a robust end-to-end reconstruction algorithm. This makes the reconstruction of highly realistic flow motions possible, even from only a single input view. We show with a variety of synthetic and real flows that the proposed global reconstruction of the transport process yields an improved reconstruction of the fluid motion."
2104.08029,T-LEAP: Occlusion-robust pose estimation of walking cows using temporal   information,"As herd size on dairy farms continues to increase, automatic health monitoring of cows is gaining in interest. Lameness, a prevalent health disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A cow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most animal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame by frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the static and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples of 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by adding artificial occlusions to the videos.The experiments showed that, on non-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data was beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as dairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was evaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in the training set). The results showed that the average PCKh@0.2 was of 93.8% on known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model was capable of generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new herds. Finally, we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and unknown cows, a deeper architecture was more beneficial."
2104.08390,Universal Background Subtraction based on Arithmetic Distribution Neural   Network,"We propose a universal background subtraction framework based on the Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network (ADNN) for learning the distributions of temporal pixels. In our ADNN model, the arithmetic distribution operations are utilized to introduce the arithmetic distribution layers, including the product distribution layer and the sum distribution layer. Furthermore, in order to improve the accuracy of the proposed approach, an improved Bayesian refinement model based on neighboring information, with a GPU implementation, is incorporated. In the forward pass and backpropagation of the proposed arithmetic distribution layers, histograms are considered as probability density functions rather than matrices. Thus, the proposed approach is able to utilize the probability information of the histogram and achieve promising results with a very simple architecture compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. Evaluations using standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to propose network layers based on arithmetic distribution operations for learning distributions during background subtraction."
2104.09008,Kernel Adversarial Learning for Real-world Image Super-resolution,"Current deep image super-resolution (SR) approaches aim to restore high-resolution images from down-sampled images or by assuming degradation from simple Gaussian kernels and additive noises. However, these techniques only assume crude approximations of the real-world image degradation process, which should involve complex kernels and noise patterns that are difficult to model using simple assumptions. In this paper, we propose a more realistic process to synthesise low-resolution images for real-world image SR by introducing a new Kernel Adversarial Learning Super-resolution (KASR) framework. In the proposed framework, degradation kernels and noises are adaptively modelled rather than explicitly specified. Moreover, we also propose a high-frequency selective objective and an iterative supervision process to further boost the model SR reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on real-world datasets."
2104.11977,Generalized moduli of continuity under irregular or random deformations   via multiscale analysis,"Motivated by the problem of robustness to deformations of the input for deep convolutional neural networks, we identify signal classes which are inherently stable to irregular deformations induced by distortion fields $\tau\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d;\mathbb{R}^d)$, to be characterized in terms of a generalized modulus of continuity associated with the deformation operator. Resorting to ideas of harmonic and multiscale analysis, we prove that for signals in multiresolution approximation spaces $U_s$ at scale $s$, stability in $L^2$ holds in the regime $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\ll 1$ - essentially as an effect of the uncertainty principle. Instability occurs when $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\gg 1$, and we provide a sharp upper bound for the asymptotic growth rate. The stability results are then extended to signals in the Besov space $B^{d/2}_{2,1}$ tailored to the given multiresolution approximation. We also consider the case of more general time-frequency deformations. Finally, we provide stochastic versions of the aforementioned results, namely we study the issue of stability in mean when $\tau(x)$ is modeled as a random field (not bounded, in general) with identically distributed variables $|\tau(x)|$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$."
2104.12294,Wise-SrNet: A Novel Architecture for Enhancing Image Classification by   Learning Spatial Resolution of Feature Maps,"One of the main challenges since the advancement of convolutional neural networks is how to connect the extracted feature map to the final classification layer. VGG models used two sets of fully connected layers for the classification part of their architectures, which significantly increased the number of models' weights. ResNet and the next deep convolutional models used the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer to compress the feature map and feed it to the classification layer. Although using the GAP layer reduces the computational cost, but also causes losing spatial resolution of the feature map, which results in decreasing learning efficiency. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem by replacing the GAP layer with a new architecture called Wise-SrNet. It is inspired by the depthwise convolutional idea and is designed for processing spatial resolution while not increasing computational cost. We have evaluated our method using three different datasets: Intel Image Classification Challenge, MIT Indoors Scenes, and a part of the ImageNet dataset. We investigated the implementation of our architecture on several models of the Inception, ResNet, and DenseNet families. Applying our architecture has revealed a significant effect on increasing convergence speed and accuracy. Our Experiments on images with 224*224 resolution increased the Top-1 accuracy between 2% to 8% on different datasets and models. Running our models on 512*512 resolution images of the MIT Indoors Scenes dataset showed a notable result of improving the Top-1 accuracy within 3% to 26%. We will also demonstrate the GAP layer's disadvantage when the input images are large and the number of classes is not few. In this circumstance, our proposed architecture can do a great help in enhancing classification results. The code is shared at https://github.com/mr7495/image-classification-spatial."
2104.12581,FedDPGAN: Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial   Networks Framework for the Detection of COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Existing deep learning technologies generally learn the features of chest X-ray data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause the privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) frame-work which is a new technique being used to protect the data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a FederatedDifferentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detectCOVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, The evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR) images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia). A large number of the truthful reports make the verification of our model can effectively diagnose COVID-19 without compromising privacy."
2104.12668,Appearance-based Gaze Estimation With Deep Learning: A Review and   Benchmark,"Human gaze provides valuable information on human focus and intentions, making it a crucial area of research. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized appearance-based gaze estimation. However, due to the unique features of gaze estimation research, such as the unfair comparison between 2D gaze positions and 3D gaze vectors and the different pre-processing and post-processing methods, there is a lack of a definitive guideline for developing deep learning-based gaze estimation algorithms. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the appearance-based gaze estimation methods using deep learning. Firstly, we survey the existing gaze estimation algorithms along the typical gaze estimation pipeline: deep feature extraction, deep learning model design, personal calibration and platforms. Secondly, to fairly compare the performance of different approaches, we summarize the data pre-processing and post-processing methods, including face/eye detection, data rectification, 2D/3D gaze conversion and gaze origin conversion. Finally, we set up a comprehensive benchmark for deep learning-based gaze estimation. We characterize all the public datasets and provide the source code of typical gaze estimation algorithms. This paper serves not only as a reference to develop deep learning-based gaze estimation methods, but also a guideline for future gaze estimation research.

2104.13395,ACDC: The Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for Robust   Semantic Driving Scene Perception,"Level-5 driving automation requires a robust visual perception system that can parse input images under any condition. However, existing driving datasets for dense semantic perception are either dominated by images captured under normal conditions or are small in scale. To address this, we introduce ACDC, the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for training and testing methods for diverse semantic perception tasks on adverse visual conditions. ACDC consists of a large set of 8012 images, half of which (4006) are equally distributed between four common adverse conditions: fog, nighttime, rain, and snow. Each adverse-condition image comes with a high-quality pixel-level panoptic annotation, a corresponding image of the same scene under normal conditions, and a binary mask that distinguishes between intra-image regions of clear and uncertain semantic content. 1503 of the corresponding normal-condition images feature panoptic annotations, raising the total annotated images to 5509. ACDC supports the standard tasks of semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, as well as the newly introduced uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation. A detailed empirical study demonstrates the challenges that the adverse domains of ACDC pose to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches and indicates the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field. Our dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://acdc.vision.ee.ethz.ch"
2105.00582,Semi-supervised learning for generalizable intracranial hemorrhage   detection and segmentation,"Purpose: To develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning model for intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation on an out-of-distribution head CT evaluation set.   Materials and Methods: This retrospective study used semi-supervised learning to bootstrap performance. An initial ""teacher"" deep learning model was trained on 457 pixel-labeled head CT scans collected from one US institution from 2010-2017 and used to generate pseudo-labels on a separate unlabeled corpus of 25000 examinations from the RSNA and ASNR. A second ""student"" model was trained on this combined pixel- and pseudo-labeled dataset. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on a validation set of 93 scans. Testing for both classification (n=481 examinations) and segmentation (n=23 examinations, or 529 images) was performed on CQ500, a dataset of 481 scans performed in India, to evaluate out-of-distribution generalizability. The semi-supervised model was compared with a baseline model trained on only labeled data using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and average precision (AP) metrics.   Results: The semi-supervised model achieved statistically significantly higher examination AUC on CQ500 compared with the baseline (0.939 [0.938, 0.940] vs. 0.907 [0.906, 0.908]) (p=0.009). It also achieved a higher DSC (0.829 [0.825, 0.833] vs. 0.809 [0.803, 0.812]) (p=0.012) and Pixel AP (0.848 [0.843, 0.853]) vs. 0.828 [0.817, 0.828]) compared to the baseline.   Conclusion: The addition of unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning framework demonstrates stronger generalizability potential for intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation compared with a supervised baseline."
2105.03026,Efficient Masked Face Recognition Method during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an unparalleled crisis leading to a huge number of casualties and security problems. In order to reduce the spread of coronavirus, people often wear masks to protect themselves. This makes face recognition a very difficult task since certain parts of the face are hidden. A primary focus of researchers during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is to come up with suggestions to handle this problem through rapid and efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a reliable method based on occlusion removal and deep learning-based features in order to address the problem of the masked face recognition process. The first step is to remove the masked face region. Next, we apply three pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) namely, VGG-16, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, and use them to extract deep features from the obtained regions (mostly eyes and forehead regions). The Bag-of-features paradigm is then applied to the feature maps of the last convolutional layer in order to quantize them and to get a slight representation comparing to the fully connected layer of classical CNN. Finally, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is applied for the classification process. Experimental results on Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset show high recognition performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods."
2105.03053,Salient Objects in Clutter,"This paper identifies and addresses a serious design bias of existing salient object detection (SOD) datasets, which unrealistically assume that each image should contain at least one clear and uncluttered salient object. This design bias has led to a saturation in performance for state-of-the-art SOD models when evaluated on existing datasets. However, these models are still far from satisfactory when applied to real-world scenes. Based on our analyses, we propose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark. Specifically, our dataset, called Salient Objects in Clutter~\textbf{(SOC)}, includes images with both salient and non-salient objects from several common object categories. In addition to object category annotations, each salient image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in common scenes, which can help provide deeper insight into the SOD problem. Further, with a given saliency encoder, e.g., the backbone network, existing saliency models are designed to achieve mapping from the training image set to the training ground-truth set. We, therefore, argue that improving the dataset can yield higher performance gains than focusing only on the decoder design. With this in mind, we investigate several dataset-enhancement strategies, including label smoothing to implicitly emphasize salient boundaries, random image augmentation to adapt saliency models to various scenarios, and self-supervised learning as a regularization strategy to learn from small datasets. Our extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of these tricks. We also provide a comprehensive benchmark for SOD, which can be found in our repository: https://github.com/DengPingFan/SODBenchmark."
2105.03857,Attention-Based 3D Seismic Fault Segmentation Training by a Few 2D Slice   Labels,"Detection faults in seismic data is a crucial step for seismic structural interpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent works regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation requires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure and lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a huge workload. In this study, we present lambda-BCE and lambda-smooth L1loss to effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices. In order to fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic noise, we propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision training and embedded in the network. The attention heatmap label is generated by the original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the lambda-smooth L1loss. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our loss function, the method can extract 3D seismic features from a few 2D slice labels. And it also shows the advanced performance of the attention module, which can significantly suppress the noise in the seismic data while increasing the model's sensitivity to the foreground. Finally, on the public test set, we only use the 2D slice labels training that accounts for 3.3% of the 3D volume label, and achieve similar performance to the 3D volume label training."
2105.04014,DiagSet: a dataset for prostate cancer histopathological image   classification,"Cancer diseases constitute one of the most significant societal challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel histopathological dataset for prostate cancer detection. The proposed dataset, consisting of over 2.6 million tissue patches extracted from 430 fully annotated scans, 4675 scans with assigned binary diagnoses, and 46 scans with diagnoses independently provided by a group of histopathologists can be found at https://github.com/michalkoziarski/DiagSet. Furthermore, we propose a machine learning framework for detection of cancerous tissue regions and prediction of scan-level diagnosis, utilizing thresholding to abstain from the decision in uncertain cases. The proposed approach, composed of ensembles of deep neural networks operating on the histopathological scans at different scales, achieves 94.6% accuracy in patch-level recognition and is compared in a scan-level diagnosis with 9 human histopathologists showing high statistical agreement."
2105.08190,Graph Neural Networks for Knowledge Enhanced Visual Representation of Paintings,"We propose ArtSAGENet, a novel multimodal architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to jointly learn visual and semantic-based artistic representations. First, we illustrate the significant advantages of multi-task learning for fine art analysis and argue that it is conceptually a much more appropriate setting in the fine art domain than the single-task alternatives. We further demonstrate that several GNN architectures can outperform strong CNN baselines in a range of fine art analysis tasks, such as style classification, artist attribution, creation period estimation, and tag prediction, while training them requires an order of magnitude less computational time and only a small amount of labeled data. Finally, through extensive experimentation we show that our proposed ArtSAGENet captures and encodes valuable relational dependencies between the artists and the artworks, surpassing the performance of traditional methods that rely solely on the analysis of visual content. Our findings underline a great potential of integrating visual content and semantics for fine art analysis and curation."
2105.08382,Transfer learning approach to Classify the X-ray image that corresponds   to corona disease Using ResNet50 pretrained by ChexNet,"Coronavirus adversely has affected people worldwide. There are common symptoms between the Covid19 virus disease and other respiratory diseases like pneumonia or Influenza. Therefore, diagnosing it fast is crucial not only to save patients but also to prevent it from spreading. One of the most reliant methods of diagnosis is through X-ray images of a lung. With the help of deep learning approaches, we can teach the deep model to learn the condition of an affected lung. Therefore, it can classify the new sample as if it is a Covid19 infected patient or not. In this project, we train a deep model based on ResNet50 pretrained by ImageNet dataset and CheXNet dataset. Based on the imbalanced CoronaHack Chest X-Ray dataset introducing by Kaggle we applied both binary and multi-class classification. Also, we compare the results when using Focal loss and Cross entropy loss."
2105.08468,Progressively Normalized Self-Attention Network for Video Polyp   Segmentation,"Existing video polyp segmentation (VPS) models typically employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features. However, due to their limited receptive fields, CNNs can not fully exploit the global temporal and spatial information in successive video frames, resulting in false-positive segmentation results. In this paper, we propose the novel PNS-Net (Progressively Normalized Self-attention Network), which can efficiently learn representations from polyp videos with real-time speed (~140fps) on a single RTX 2080 GPU and no post-processing. Our PNS-Net is based solely on a basic normalized self-attention block, equipping with recurrence and CNNs entirely. Experiments on challenging VPS datasets demonstrate that the proposed PNS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also conduct extensive experiments to study the effectiveness of the channel split, soft-attention, and progressive learning strategy. We find that our PNS-Net works well under different settings, making it a promising solution to the VPS task."
2105.08620,Adversarial Examples Detection with Bayesian Neural Network,"In this paper, we propose a new framework to detect adversarial examples motivated by the observations that random components can improve the smoothness of predictors and make it easier to simulate the output distribution of a deep neural network. With these observations, we propose a novel Bayesian adversarial example detector, short for BATer, to improve the performance of adversarial example detection. Specifically, we study the distributional difference of hidden layer output between natural and adversarial examples, and propose to use the randomness of the Bayesian neural network to simulate hidden layer output distribution and leverage the distribution dispersion to detect adversarial examples. The advantage of a Bayesian neural network is that the output is stochastic while a deep neural network without random components does not have such characteristics. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets against popular attacks show that the proposed BATer outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors in adversarial example detection."
2105.08876,A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Scheme Using Label-based Pixel Block   Mixing for Image Classification in Deep Learning,"To ensure the privacy of sensitive data used in the training of deep learning models, a number of privacy-preserving methods have been designed by the research community. However, existing schemes are generally designed to work with textual data, or are not efficient when a large number of images is used for training. Hence, in this paper we propose a lightweight and efficient approach to preserve image privacy while maintaining the availability of the training set. Specifically, we design the pixel block mixing algorithm for image classification privacy preservation in deep learning. To evaluate its utility, we use the mixed training set to train the ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 models on the WIKI dataset and the CNBC face dataset. Experimental findings on the testing set show that our scheme preserves image privacy while maintaining the availability of the training set in the deep learning models. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate that we achieve good performance for the VGG16 model on the WIKI dataset and both ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on the CNBC dataset. The pixel block algorithm achieves fairly high efficiency in the mixing of the images, and it is computationally challenging for the attackers to restore the mixed training set to the original training set. Moreover, data augmentation can be applied to the mixed training set to improve the training's effectiveness."
2105.10926,Rethinking Global Context in Crowd Counting,"This paper investigates the role of global context for crowd counting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with global information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification, we add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information exchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer layers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the tried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module (TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed by the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person count of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments on various datasets, including ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++ and NWPU, demonstrate that the proposed context extraction techniques can significantly improve the performance over the baselines."
2105.11307,LineCounter: Learning Handwritten Text Line Segmentation by Counting,"Handwritten Text Line Segmentation (HTLS) is a low-level but important task for many higher-level document processing tasks like handwritten text recognition. It is often formulated in terms of semantic segmentation or object detection in deep learning. However, both formulations have serious shortcomings. The former requires heavy post-processing of splitting/merging adjacent segments, while the latter may fail on dense or curved texts. In this paper, we propose a novel Line Counting formulation for HTLS -- that involves counting the number of text lines from the top at every pixel location. This formulation helps learn an end-to-end HTLS solution that directly predicts per-pixel line number for a given document image. Furthermore, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) model LineCounter to perform HTLS through the Line Counting formulation. Our extensive experiments on the three public datasets (ICDAR2013-HSC, HIT-MW, and VML-AHTE) demonstrate that LineCounter outperforms state-of-the-art HTLS approaches. Source code is available at https://github.com/Leedeng/Line-Counter."
2105.12227,Learning a Model-Driven Variational Network for Deformable Image   Registration,"Data-driven deep learning approaches to image registration can be less accurate than conventional iterative approaches, especially when training data is limited. To address this whilst retaining the fast inference speed of deep learning, we propose VR-Net, a novel cascaded variational network for unsupervised deformable image registration. Using the variable splitting optimization scheme, we first convert the image registration problem, established in a generic variational framework, into two sub-problems, one with a point-wise, closed-form solution while the other one is a denoising problem. We then propose two neural layers (i.e. warping layer and intensity consistency layer) to model the analytical solution and a residual U-Net to formulate the denoising problem (i.e. generalized denoising layer). Finally, we cascade the warping layer, intensity consistency layer, and generalized denoising layer to form the VR-Net. Extensive experiments on three (two 2D and one 3D) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging datasets show that VR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods on registration accuracy, while maintains the fast inference speed of deep learning and the data-efficiency of variational model."
2105.12436,Social-IWSTCNN: A Social Interaction-Weighted Spatio-Temporal   Convolutional Neural Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in Urban   Traffic Scenarios,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction in urban scenarios is essential for automated driving. This task is challenging because the behavior of pedestrians is influenced by both their own history paths and the interactions with others. Previous research modeled these interactions with pooling mechanisms or aggregating with hand-crafted attention weights. In this paper, we present the Social Interaction-Weighted Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (Social-IWSTCNN), which includes both the spatial and the temporal features. We propose a novel design, namely the Social Interaction Extractor, to learn the spatial and social interaction features of pedestrians. Most previous works used ETH and UCY datasets which include five scenes but do not cover urban traffic scenarios extensively for training and evaluation. In this paper, we use the recently released large-scale Waymo Open Dataset in urban traffic scenarios, which includes 374 urban training scenes and 76 urban testing scenes to analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The results show that our algorithm outperforms SOTA algorithms such as Social-LSTM, Social-GAN, and Social-STGCNN on both Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). Furthermore, our Social-IWSTCNN is 54.8 times faster in data pre-processing speed, and 4.7 times faster in total test speed than the current best SOTA algorithm Social-STGCNN."
2105.12872,Benchmarking Scientific Image Forgery Detectors,"The scientific image integrity area presents a challenging research bottleneck, the lack of available datasets to design and evaluate forensic techniques. Its data sensitivity creates a legal hurdle that prevents one to rely on real tampered cases to build any sort of accessible forensic benchmark. To mitigate this bottleneck, we present an extendable open-source library that reproduces the most common image forgery operations reported by the research integrity community: duplication, retouching, and cleaning. Using this library and realistic scientific images, we create a large scientific forgery image benchmark (39,423 images) with an enriched ground-truth. In addition, concerned about the high number of retracted papers due to image duplication, this work evaluates the state-of-the-art copy-move detection methods in the proposed dataset, using a new metric that asserts consistent match detection between the source and the copied region. The dataset and source-code will be freely available upon acceptance of the paper."
2105.13153,Cardiac Segmentation on CT Images through Shape-Aware Contour Attentions,"Cardiac segmentation of atriums, ventricles, and myocardium in computed tomography (CT) images is an important first-line task for presymptomatic cardiovascular disease diagnosis. In several recent studies, deep learning models have shown significant breakthroughs in medical image segmentation tasks. Unlike other organs such as the lungs and liver, the cardiac organ consists of multiple substructures, i.e., ventricles, atriums, aortas, arteries, veins, and myocardium. These cardiac substructures are proximate to each other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity values), making it difficult for the segmentation network focus on the boundaries between the substructures. In this paper, to improve the segmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel model to exploit shape and boundary-aware features. We primarily propose a shape-aware attention module, that exploits distance regression, which can guide the model to focus on the edges between substructures so that it can outperform the conventional contour-based attention method. In the experiments, we used the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation dataset that has 20 CT cardiac images for training and validation, and 40 CT cardiac images for testing. The experimental results show that the proposed network produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art networks by improving the Dice similarity coefficient score by 4.97%. Our proposed shape-aware contour attention mechanism demonstrates that distance transformation and boundary features improve the actual attention map to strengthen the responses in the boundary area. Moreover, our proposed method significantly reduces the false-positive responses of the final output, resulting in accurate segmentation."
2105.14257,Diffusion-Based Representation Learning,"Diffusion-based methods represented as stochastic differential equations on a continuous-time domain have recently proven successful as a non-adversarial generative model. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion-based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score matching objective and thus encodes the information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code that achieves improvements of state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. We also compare the quality of learned representations of diffusion score matching with other methods like autoencoder and contrastively trained systems through their performances on downstream tasks."
2105.14711,CTSpine1K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Spinal Vertebrae Segmentation in   Computed Tomography,"Spine-related diseases have high morbidity and cause a huge burden of social cost. Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT) images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation, labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image super-resolution, and enhancement."
2106.00557,Towards Interpretable Attention Networks for Cervical Cancer Analysis,"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of automated frameworks for analysing medical images and signals, including analysis of cervical cancer. Many previous works focus on the analysis of isolated cervical cells, or do not offer sufficient methods to explain and understand how the proposed models reach their classification decisions on multi-cell images. Here, we evaluate various state-of-the-art deep learning models and attention-based frameworks for the classification of images of multiple cervical cells. As we aim to provide interpretable deep learning models to address this task, we also compare their explainability through the visualization of their gradients. We demonstrate the importance of using images that contain multiple cells over using isolated single-cell images. We show the effectiveness of the residual channel attention model for extracting important features from a group of cells, and demonstrate this model's efficiency for this classification task. This work highlights the benefits of channel attention mechanisms in analyzing multiple-cell images for potential relations and distributions within a group of cells. It also provides interpretable models to address the classification of cervical cells."
2106.01061,Rethinking Cross-modal Interaction from a Top-down Perspective for   Referring Video Object Segmentation,"Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment video objects with the guidance of natural language reference. Previous methods typically tackle RVOS through directly grounding linguistic reference over the image lattice. Such bottom-up strategy fails to explore object-level cues, easily leading to inferior results. In this work, we instead put forward a two-stage, top-down RVOS solution. First, an exhaustive set of object tracklets is constructed by propagating object masks detected from several sampled frames to the entire video. Second, a Transformer-based tracklet-language grounding module is proposed, which models instance-level visual relations and cross-modal interactions simultaneously and efficiently. Our model ranks first place on CVPR2021 Referring Youtube-VOS challenge."
2106.03180,Vision Transformers with Hierarchical Attention,"This paper tackles the high computational/space complexity associated with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in vanilla vision transformers. To this end, we propose Hierarchical MHSA (H-MHSA), a novel approach that computes self-attention in a hierarchical fashion. Specifically, we first divide the input image into patches as commonly done, and each patch is viewed as a token. Then, the proposed H-MHSA learns token relationships within local patches, serving as local relationship modeling. Then, the small patches are merged into larger ones, and H-MHSA models the global dependencies for the small number of the merged tokens. At last, the local and global attentive features are aggregated to obtain features with powerful representation capacity. Since we only calculate attention for a limited number of tokens at each step, the computational load is reduced dramatically. Hence, H-MHSA can efficiently model global relationships among tokens without sacrificing fine-grained information. With the H-MHSA module incorporated, we build a family of Hierarchical-Attention-based Transformer Networks, namely HAT-Net. To demonstrate the superiority of HAT-Net in scene understanding, we conduct extensive experiments on fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Therefore, HAT-Net provides a new perspective for vision transformers. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/yun-liu/HAT-Net."
2106.03316,Exploring to establish an appropriate model for image aesthetic   assessment via CNN-based RSRL: An empirical study,"To establish an appropriate model for photo aesthetic assessment, in this paper, a D-measure which reflects the disentanglement degree of the final layer FC nodes of CNN is introduced. By combining F-measure with D-measure to obtain a FD measure, an algorithm of determining the optimal model from the multiple photo score prediction models generated by CNN-based repetitively self-revised learning(RSRL) is proposed. Furthermore, the first fixation perspective(FFP) and the assessment interest region(AIR) of the models are defined and calculated. The experimental results show that the FD measure is effective for establishing the appropriate model from the multiple score prediction models with different CNN structures. Moreover, the FD-determined optimal models with the comparatively high FD always have the FFP an AIR which are close to the human's aesthetic perception when enjoying photos."
2106.03336,Wide-Baseline Relative Camera Pose Estimation with Directional Learning,"Modern deep learning techniques that regress the relative camera pose between two images have difficulty dealing with challenging scenarios, such as large camera motions resulting in occlusions and significant changes in perspective that leave little overlap between images. These models continue to struggle even with the benefit of large supervised training datasets. To address the limitations of these models, we take inspiration from techniques that show regressing keypoint locations in 2D and 3D can be improved by estimating a discrete distribution over keypoint locations. Analogously, in this paper we explore improving camera pose regression by instead predicting a discrete distribution over camera poses. To realize this idea, we introduce DirectionNet, which estimates discrete distributions over the 5D relative pose space using a novel parameterization to make the estimation problem tractable. Specifically, DirectionNet factorizes relative camera pose, specified by a 3D rotation and a translation direction, into a set of 3D direction vectors. Since 3D directions can be identified with points on the sphere, DirectionNet estimates discrete distributions on the sphere as its output. We evaluate our model on challenging synthetic and real pose estimation datasets constructed from Matterport3D and InteriorNet. Promising results show a near 50% reduction in error over direct regression methods."
2106.04274,3D Human Pose Estimation Based on 2D-3D Consistency with Synchronized   Adversarial Training,"3D human pose estimation from a single image is still a challenging problem despite the large amount of work that has been performed in this field. Generally, most methods directly use neural networks and ignore certain constraints (e.g., reprojection constraints, joint angle, and bone length constraints). While a few methods consider these constraints but train the network separately, they cannot effectively solve the depth ambiguity problem. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based model for 3D human pose estimation, in which a reprojection network is employed to learn the mapping of the distribution from 3D poses to 2D poses, and a discriminator is employed for 2D-3D consistency discrimination. We adopt a novel strategy to synchronously train the generator, the reprojection network and the discriminator. Furthermore, inspired by the typical kinematic chain space (KCS) matrix, we introduce a weighted KCS matrix and take it as one of the discriminator's inputs to impose joint angle and bone length constraints. The experimental results on Human3.6M show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases."
2106.04852,Deep Tiny Network for Recognition-Oriented Face Image Quality Assessment,"Face recognition has made significant progress in recent years due to deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). In many face recognition (FR) scenarios, face images are acquired from a sequence with huge intra-variations. These intra-variations, which are mainly affected by the low-quality face images, cause instability of recognition performance. Previous works have focused on ad-hoc methods to select frames from a video or use face image quality assessment (FIQA) methods, which consider only a particular or combination of several distortions.   In this work, we present an efficient non-reference image quality assessment for FR that directly links image quality assessment (IQA) and FR. More specifically, we propose a new measurement to evaluate image quality without any reference. Based on the proposed quality measurement, we propose a deep Tiny Face Quality network (tinyFQnet) to learn a quality prediction function from data.   We evaluate the proposed method for different powerful FR models on two classical video-based (or template-based) benchmark: IJB-B and YTF. Extensive experiments show that, although the tinyFQnet is much smaller than the others, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."
2106.05109,Gaussian Mixture Estimation from Weighted Samples,"We consider estimating the parameters of a Gaussian mixture density with a given number of components best representing a given set of weighted samples. We adopt a density interpretation of the samples by viewing them as a discrete Dirac mixture density over a continuous domain with weighted components. Hence, Gaussian mixture fitting is viewed as density re-approximation. In order to speed up computation, an expectation-maximization method is proposed that properly considers not only the sample locations, but also the corresponding weights. It is shown that methods from literature do not treat the weights correctly, resulting in wrong estimates. This is demonstrated with simple counterexamples. The proposed method works in any number of dimensions with the same computational load as standard Gaussian mixture estimators for unweighted samples."
2106.05152,Rethinking Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification,"Transfer learning (TL) from pretrained deep models is a standard practice in modern medical image classification (MIC). However, what levels of features to be reused are problem-dependent, and uniformly finetuning all layers of pretrained models may be suboptimal. This insight has partly motivated the recent differential TL strategies, such as TransFusion (TF) and layer-wise finetuning (LWFT), which treat the layers in the pretrained models differentially. In this paper, we add one more strategy into this family, called TruncatedTL, which reuses and finetunes appropriate bottom layers and directly discards the remaining layers. This yields not only superior MIC performance but also compact models for efficient inference, compared to other differential TL methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sun-umn/TTL"
2106.05308,Visual Sensor Pose Optimisation Using Visibility Models for Smart Cities,"Visual sensor networks are used for monitoring traffic in large cities and are promised to support automated driving in complex road segments. The pose of these sensors, i.e. position and orientation, directly determines the coverage of the driving environment, and the ability to detect and track objects navigating therein. Existing sensor pose optimisation methods either maximise the coverage of ground surfaces, or consider the visibility of target objects (e.g. cars) as binary variables, which fails to represent their degree of visibility. For example, such formulations fail in cluttered environments where multiple objects occlude each other. This paper proposes two novel sensor pose optimisation methods, one based on gradient-ascent and one using integer programming techniques, which maximise the visibility of multiple target objects. Both methods are based on a rendering engine that provides pixel-level visibility information about the target objects, and thus, can cope with occlusions in cluttered environments. The methods are evaluated in a complex driving environment and show improved visibility of target objects when compared to existing methods. Such methods can be used to guide the cost effective deployment of sensor networks in smart cities to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic monitoring systems."
2106.05453,Improving White-box Robustness of Pre-processing Defenses via Joint   Adversarial Training,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. A range of adversarial defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate the interference of adversarial noise, among which the input pre-processing methods are scalable and show great potential to safeguard DNNs. However, pre-processing methods may suffer from the robustness degradation effect, in which the defense reduces rather than improving the adversarial robustness of a target model in a white-box setting. A potential cause of this negative effect is that adversarial training examples are static and independent to the pre-processing model. To solve this problem, we investigate the influence of full adversarial examples which are crafted against the full model, and find they indeed have a positive impact on the robustness of defenses. Furthermore, we find that simply changing the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not completely alleviate the robustness degradation effect. This is due to the adversarial risk of the pre-processed model being neglected, which is another cause of the robustness degradation effect. Motivated by above analyses, we propose a method called Joint Adversarial Training based Pre-processing (JATP) defense. Specifically, we formulate a feature similarity based adversarial risk for the pre-processing model by using full adversarial examples found in a feature space. Unlike standard adversarial training, we only update the pre-processing model, which prompts us to introduce a pixel-wise loss to improve its cross-model transferability. We then conduct a joint adversarial training on the pre-processing model to minimize this overall risk. Empirical results show that our method could effectively mitigate the robustness degradation effect across different target models in comparison to previous state-of-the-art approaches."
2106.06072,Gaussian Bounding Boxes and Probabilistic Intersection-over-Union for   Object Detection,"Most object detection methods use bounding boxes to encode and represent the object shape and location. In this work, we explore a fuzzy representation of object regions using Gaussian distributions, which provides an implicit binary representation as (potentially rotated) ellipses. We also present a similarity measure for the Gaussian distributions based on the Hellinger Distance, which can be viewed as a Probabilistic Intersection-over-Union (ProbIoU). Our experimental results show that the proposed Gaussian representations are closer to annotated segmentation masks in publicly available datasets, and that loss functions based on ProbIoU can be successfully used to regress the parameters of the Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we present a simple mapping scheme from traditional (or rotated) bounding boxes to Gaussian representations, allowing the proposed ProbIoU-based losses to be seamlessly integrated into any object detector."
2106.06360,Conterfactual Generative Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"zero-shot learning is an essential part of computer vision. As a classical downstream task, zero-shot semantic segmentation has been studied because of its applicant value. One of the popular zero-shot semantic segmentation methods is based on the generative model Most new proposed works added structures on the same architecture to enhance this model. However, we found that, from the view of causal inference, the result of the original model has been influenced by spurious statistical relationships. Thus the performance of the prediction shows severe bias. In this work, we consider counterfactual methods to avoid the confounder in the original model. Based on this method, we proposed a new framework for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our model is compared with baseline models on two real-world datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context. The experiment results show proposed models can surpass previous confounded models and can still make use of additional structures to improve the performance. We also design a simple structure based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) in this work."
2106.06733,LENAS: Learning-based Neural Architecture Search and Ensemble for 3D   Radiotherapy Dose Prediction,"Radiation therapy treatment planning requires balancing the delivery of the target dose while sparing normal tissues, making it a complex process. To streamline the planning process and enhance its quality, there is a growing demand for knowledge-based planning (KBP). Ensemble learning has shown impressive power in various deep learning tasks, and it has great potential to improve the performance of KBP. However, the effectiveness of ensemble learning heavily depends on the diversity and individual accuracy of the base learners. Moreover, the complexity of model ensembles is a major concern, as it requires maintaining multiple models during inference, leading to increased computational cost and storage overhead. In this study, we propose a novel learning-based ensemble approach named LENAS, which integrates neural architecture search with knowledge distillation for 3D radiotherapy dose prediction. Our approach starts by exhaustively searching each block from an enormous architecture space to identify multiple architectures that exhibit promising performance and significant diversity. To mitigate the complexity introduced by the model ensemble, we adopt the teacher-student paradigm, leveraging the diverse outputs from multiple learned networks as supervisory signals to guide the training of the student network. Furthermore, to preserve high-level semantic information, we design a hybrid-loss to optimize the student network, enabling it to recover the knowledge embedded within the teacher networks. The proposed method has been evaluated on two public datasets, OpenKBP and AIMIS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods."
2106.06769,Cross-Subject Domain Adaptation for Classifying Working Memory Load with   Multi-Frame EEG Images,"Working memory (WM), denoting the information temporally stored in the mind, is a fundamental research topic in the field of human cognition. Electroencephalograph (EEG), which can monitor the electrical activity of the brain, has been widely used in measuring the level of WM. However, one of the critical challenges is that individual differences may cause ineffective results, especially when the established model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a cross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to generalize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform EEG time series into multi-frame EEG images incorporating spatial, spectral, and temporal information. First, the Subject-Shared module in CS-DASA receives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and learns the common feature representations. Then, in the subject-specific module, the maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution divergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective penalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject spatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the discriminative spatial features from the target image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG dataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of achieving better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods."
2106.07256,Deterministic Guided LiDAR Depth Map Completion,"Accurate dense depth estimation is crucial for autonomous vehicles to analyze their environment. This paper presents a non-deep learning-based approach to densify a sparse LiDAR-based depth map using a guidance RGB image. To achieve this goal the RGB image is at first cleared from most of the camera-LiDAR misalignment artifacts. Afterward, it is over segmented and a plane for each superpixel is approximated. In the case a superpixel is not well represented by a plane, a plane is approximated for a convex hull of the most inlier. Finally, the pinhole camera model is used for the interpolation process and the remaining areas are interpolated. The evaluation of this work is executed using the KITTI depth completion benchmark, which validates the proposed work and shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art non-deep learning-based methods, in addition to several deep learning-based methods."
2106.07565,Video-Based Inpatient Fall Risk Assessment: A Case Study,"Inpatient falls are a serious safety issue in hospitals and healthcare facilities. Recent advances in video analytics for patient monitoring provide a non-intrusive avenue to reduce this risk through continuous activity monitoring. However, in-bed fall risk assessment systems have received less attention in the literature. The majority of prior studies have focused on fall event detection, and do not consider the circumstances that may indicate an imminent inpatient fall. Here, we propose a video-based system that can monitor the risk of a patient falling, and alert staff of unsafe behaviour to help prevent falls before they occur. We propose an approach that leverages recent advances in human localisation and skeleton pose estimation to extract spatial features from video frames recorded in a simulated environment. We demonstrate that body positions can be effectively recognised and provide useful evidence for fall risk assessment. This work highlights the benefits of video-based models for analysing behaviours of interest, and demonstrates how such a system could enable sufficient lead time for healthcare professionals to respond and address patient needs, which is necessary for the development of fall intervention programs."
2106.08557,Unsupervised-learning-based method for chest MRI-CT transformation using   structure constrained unsupervised generative attention networks,"The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scanner facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of metabolic information via PET and morphological information with high soft-tissue contrast using MRI. Although PET/MRI facilitates the capture of high-accuracy fusion images, its major drawback can be attributed to the difficulty encountered when performing attenuation correction, which is necessary for quantitative PET evaluation. The combined PET/MRI scanning requires the generation of attenuation-correction maps from MRI owing to no direct relationship between the gamma-ray attenuation information and MRIs. While MRI-based bone-tissue segmentation can be readily performed for the head and pelvis regions, the realization of accurate bone segmentation via chest CT generation remains a challenging task. This can be attributed to the respiratory and cardiac motions occurring in the chest as well as its anatomically complicated structure and relatively thin bone cortex. This paper presents a means to minimise the anatomical structural changes without human annotation by adding structural constraints using a modality-independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can transform unpaired images. The results obtained in this study revealed the proposed U-GAT-IT + MIND approach to outperform all other competing approaches. The findings of this study hint towards possibility of synthesising clinically acceptable CT images from chest MRI without human annotation, thereby minimising the changes in the anatomical structure."
2106.08992,On the approximation capability of GNNs in node   classification/regression tasks,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a broad class of connectionist models for graph processing. Recent studies have shown that GNNs can approximate any function on graphs, modulo the equivalence relation on graphs defined by the Weisfeiler--Lehman (WL) test. However, these results suffer from some limitations, both because they were derived using the Stone--Weierstrass theorem -- which is existential in nature, -- and because they assume that the target function to be approximated must be continuous. Furthermore, all current results are dedicated to graph classification/regression tasks, where the GNN must produce a single output for the whole graph, while also node classification/regression problems, in which an output is returned for each node, are very common. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to demonstrate the approximation capability of GNNs that overcomes these limitations. Indeed, we show that GNNs are universal approximators in probability for node classification/regression tasks, as they can approximate any measurable function that satisfies the 1--WL equivalence on nodes. The proposed theoretical framework allows the approximation of generic discontinuous target functions and also suggests the GNN architecture that can reach a desired approximation. In addition, we provide a bound on the number of the GNN layers required to achieve the desired degree of approximation, namely $2r-1$, where $r$ is the maximum number of nodes for the graphs in the domain."
2106.10077,Combined Person Classification with Airborne Optical Sectioning,"Fully autonomous drones have been demonstrated to find lost or injured persons under strongly occluding forest canopy. Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), a novel synthetic aperture imaging technique, together with deep-learning-based classification enables high detection rates under realistic search-and-rescue conditions. We demonstrate that false detections can be significantly suppressed and true detections boosted by combining classifications from multiple AOS rather than single integral images. This improves classification rates especially in the presence of occlusion. To make this possible, we modified the AOS imaging process to support large overlaps between subsequent integrals, enabling real-time and on-board scanning and processing of groundspeeds up to 10 m/s."
2106.10160,Toward Fault Detection in Industrial Welding Processes with Deep   Learning and Data Augmentation,"With the rise of deep learning models in the field of computer vision, new possibilities for their application in industrial processes proves to return great benefits. Nevertheless, the actual fit of machine learning for highly standardised industrial processes is still under debate. This paper addresses the challenges on the industrial realization of the AI tools, considering the use case of Laser Beam Welding quality control as an example. We use object detection algorithms from the TensorFlow object detection API and adapt them to our use case using transfer learning. The baseline models we develop are used as benchmarks and evaluated and compared to models that undergo dataset scaling and hyperparameter tuning. We find that moderate scaling of the dataset via image augmentation leads to improvements in intersection over union (IoU) and recall, whereas high levels of augmentation and scaling may lead to deterioration of results. Finally, we put our results into perspective of the underlying use case and evaluate their fit."
2106.10479,Practical Transferability Estimation for Image Classification Tasks,"Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead. In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%, respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability metrics on average."
2106.11056,Paradigm selection for Data Fusion of SAR and Multispectral Sentinel   data applied to Land-Cover Classification,"Data fusion is a well-known technique, becoming more and more popular in the Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation (AI4EO) domain mainly due to its ability of reinforcing AI4EO applications by combining multiple data sources and thus bringing better results. On the other hand, like other methods for satellite data analysis, data fusion itself is also benefiting and evolving thanks to the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this letter, four data fusion paradigms, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are analyzed and implemented. The goals are to provide a systematic procedure for choosing the best data fusion framework, resulting in the best classification results, once the basic structure for the CNN has been defined, and to help interested researchers in their work when data fusion applied to remote sensing is involved. The procedure has been validated for land-cover classification but it can be transferred to other cases."
2106.11528,Recent Deep Semi-supervised Learning Approaches and Related Works,"This work proposes an overview of the recent semi-supervised learning approaches and related works. Despite the remarkable success of neural networks in various applications, there exist a few formidable constraints, including the need for a large amount of labeled data. Therefore, semi-supervised learning, which is a learning scheme in which scarce labels and a larger amount of unlabeled data are utilized to train models (e.g., deep neural networks), is getting more important. Based on the key assumptions of semi-supervised learning, which are the manifold assumption, cluster assumption, and continuity assumption, the work reviews the recent semi-supervised learning approaches. In particular, the methods in regard to using deep neural networks in a semi-supervised learning setting are primarily discussed. In addition, the existing works are first classified based on the underlying idea and explained, then the holistic approaches that unify the aforementioned ideas are detailed."
2106.11653,A Curriculum-style Self-training Approach for Source-Free Semantic   Segmentation,"Source-free domain adaptation has developed rapidly in recent years, where the well-trained source model is adapted to the target domain instead of the source data, offering the potential for privacy concerns and intellectual property protection. However, a number of feature alignment techniques in prior domain adaptation methods are not feasible in this challenging problem setting. Thereby, we resort to probing inherent domain-invariant feature learning and propose a curriculum-style self-training approach for source-free domain adaptive semantic segmentation. In particular, we introduce a curriculum-style entropy minimization method to explore the implicit knowledge from the source model, which fits the trained source model to the target data using certain information from easy-to-hard predictions. We then train the segmentation network by the proposed complementary curriculum-style self-training, which utilizes the negative and positive pseudo labels following the curriculum-learning manner. Although negative pseudo-labels with high uncertainty cannot be identified with the correct labels, they can definitely indicate absent classes. Moreover, we employ an information propagation scheme to further reduce the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain, which could act as a standard post-processing method for the domain adaptation field. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to a more challenging black-box source model scenario where only the source model's predictions are available. Extensive experiments validate that our method yields state-of-the-art performance on source-free semantic segmentation tasks for both synthetic-to-real and adverse conditions datasets. The code and corresponding trained models are released at \url{https://github.com/yxiwang/ATP}."
2106.11760,Fingerprinting Image-to-Image Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in various application scenarios. Since the production of a commercial GAN requires substantial computational and human resources, the copyright protection of GANs is urgently needed. This paper presents a novel fingerprinting scheme for the Intellectual Property (IP) protection of image-to-image GANs based on a trusted third party. We break through the stealthiness and robustness bottlenecks suffered by previous fingerprinting methods for classification models being naively transferred to GANs. Specifically, we innovatively construct a composite deep learning model from the target GAN and a classifier. Then we generate fingerprint samples from this composite model, and embed them in the classifier for effective ownership verification. This scheme inspires some concrete methodologies to practically protect the modern image-to-image translation GANs. Theoretical analysis proves that these methods can satisfy different security requirements necessary for IP protection. We also conduct extensive experiments to show that our solutions outperform existing strategies."
2106.11857,HybVIO: Pushing the Limits of Real-time Visual-inertial Odometry,"We present HybVIO, a novel hybrid approach for combining filtering-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with optimization-based SLAM. The core of our method is highly robust, independent VIO with improved IMU bias modeling, outlier rejection, stationarity detection, and feature track selection, which is adjustable to run on embedded hardware. Long-term consistency is achieved with a loosely-coupled SLAM module. In academic benchmarks, our solution yields excellent performance in all categories, especially in the real-time use case, where we outperform the current state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate the feasibility of VIO for vehicular tracking on consumer-grade hardware using a custom dataset, and show good performance in comparison to current commercial VISLAM alternatives. An open-source implementation of the HybVIO method is available at https://github.com/SpectacularAI/HybVIO"
2106.11930,On the importance of cross-task features for class-incremental learning,"In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn a sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification problem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous tasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is available at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform cross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been seen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make use of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we ablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the performance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new forgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is not the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that future algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent forgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features, and the knowledge transfer between tasks. This is especially important when tasks contain limited amount of data."
2106.14208,Representation Based Regression for Object Distance Estimation,"In this study, we propose a novel approach to predict the distances of the detected objects in an observed scene. The proposed approach modifies the recently proposed Convolutional Support Estimator Networks (CSENs). CSENs are designed to compute a direct mapping for the Support Estimation (SE) task in a representation-based classification problem. We further propose and demonstrate that representation-based methods (sparse or collaborative representation) can be used in well-designed regression problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first representation-based method proposed for performing a regression task by utilizing the modified CSENs; and hence, we name this novel approach as Representation-based Regression (RbR). The initial version of CSENs has a proxy mapping stage (i.e., a coarse estimation for the support set) that is required for the input. In this study, we improve the CSEN model by proposing Compressive Learning CSEN (CL-CSEN) that has the ability to jointly optimize the so-called proxy mapping stage along with convolutional layers. The experimental evaluations using the KITTI 3D Object Detection distance estimation dataset show that the proposed method can achieve a significantly improved distance estimation performance over all competing methods. Finally, the software implementations of the methods are publicly shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/CSENDistance."
2106.14292,Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Prediction using an Attentive Multi-Scale   Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a destructive joint disease identified by joint stiffness, pain, and functional disability concerning millions of lives across the globe. It is generally assessed by evaluating physical symptoms, medical history, and other joint screening tests like radiographs, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Unfortunately, the conventional methods are very subjective, which forms a barrier in detecting the disease progression at an early stage. This paper presents a deep learning-based framework, namely OsteoHRNet, that automatically assesses the Knee OA severity in terms of Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade classification from X-rays. As a primary novelty, the proposed approach is built upon one of the most recent deep models, called the High-Resolution Network (HRNet), to capture the multi-scale features of knee X-rays. In addition, we have also incorporated an attention mechanism to filter out the counterproductive features and boost the performance further. Our proposed model has achieved the best multiclass accuracy of 71.74% and MAE of 0.311 on the baseline cohort of the OAI dataset, which is a remarkable gain over the existing best-published works. We have also employed the Gradient-based Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAMs) visualization to justify the proposed network learning."
2106.14490,Making Images Real Again: A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Image   Composition,"As a common image editing operation, image composition (object insertion) aims to combine the foreground from one image and another background image, resulting in a composite image. However, there are many issues that could make the composite images unrealistic. These issues can be summarized as the inconsistency between foreground and background, which includes appearance inconsistency (e.g., incompatible illumination), geometry inconsistency (e.g., unreasonable size), and semantic inconsistency (e.g., mismatched semantic context). Image composition task could be decomposed into multiple sub-tasks, in which each sub-task targets at one or more issues. Specifically, object placement aims to find reasonable scale, location, and shape for the foreground. Image blending aims to address the unnatural boundary between foreground and background. Image harmonization aims to adjust the illumination statistics of foreground. Shadow (resp., reflection) generation aims to generate plausible shadow (resp., reflection) for the foreground. These sub-tasks can be executed sequentially or parallelly to acquire realistic composite images. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous survey on image composition (object insertion). In this paper, we conduct comprehensive survey over the sub-tasks and combinatorial task of image composition (object insertion). For each one, we summarize the existing methods, available datasets, and common evaluation metrics. We have also contributed the first image composition toolbox libcom, which assembles 10+ image composition related functions."
2106.15277,EPMF: Efficient Perception-aware Multi-sensor Fusion for 3D Semantic   Segmentation,"We study multi-sensor fusion for 3D semantic segmentation that is important to scene understanding for many applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Existing fusion-based methods, however, may not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between the two modalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called perception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to effectively exploit perceptual information from two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and spatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we project point clouds to the camera coordinate using perspective projection, and process both inputs from LiDAR and cameras in 2D space while preventing the information loss of RGB images. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two modalities, separately. The extracted features are fused by effective residual-based fusion modules. Moreover, we introduce additional perception-aware losses to measure the perceptual difference between the two modalities. Last, we propose an improved version of PMF, i.e., EPMF, which is more efficient and effective by optimizing data pre-processing and network architecture under perspective projection. Specifically, we propose cross-modal alignment and cropping to obtain tight inputs and reduce unnecessary computational costs. We then explore more efficient contextual modules under perspective projection and fuse the LiDAR features into the camera stream to boost the performance of the two-stream network. Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For example, on nuScenes test set, our EPMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method, i.e., RangeFormer, by 0.9% in mIoU. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ICEORY/PMF."
2106.15321,Soft Attention: Does it Actually Help to Learn Social Interactions in   Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction?,"We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using its motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians, called social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM, deep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social interactions on a pedestrian's motion. The demonstration that these models can learn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The models are compared with and without their social interactions module on two standard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error. Yet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple constant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model social interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we focus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social interaction modeling and study whether they use social information at prediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art approaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work. First, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random noise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we use a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down their inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their soft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the convergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that the soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored by the models."
2106.15989,Word-level Sign Language Recognition with Multi-stream Neural Networks   Focusing on Local Regions and Skeletal Information,"Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) has attracted attention because it is expected to overcome the communication barrier between people with speech impairment and those who can hear. In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods."
2106.16198,In-distribution adversarial attacks on object recognition models using   gradient-free search,"Neural networks are susceptible to small perturbations in the form of 2D rotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. Past works attribute these errors to dataset bias, claiming that models fail on these perturbed samples as they do not belong to the training data distribution. Here, we challenge this claim and present evidence of the widespread existence of perturbed images within the training data distribution, which networks fail to classify. We train models on data sampled from parametric distributions, then search inside this data distribution to find such in-distribution adversarial examples. This is done using our gradient-free evolution strategies (ES) based approach which we call CMA-Search. Despite training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera and light variations, CMA-Search can find a failure inside the data distribution in over 71% cases by perturbing the camera position. With lighting changes, CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 42% cases. These findings also extend to natural images from ImageNet and Co3D datasets. This phenomenon of in-distribution images presents a highly worrisome problem for artificial intelligence -- they bypass the need for a malicious agent to add engineered noise to induce an adversarial attack. All code, datasets, and demos are available at https://github.com/Spandan-Madan/in_distribution_adversarial_examples."
2107.00272,A Survey on Graph-Based Deep Learning for Computational Histopathology,"With the remarkable success of representation learning for prediction problems, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of machine learning and deep learning for the analysis of digital pathology and biopsy image patches. However, learning over patch-wise features using convolutional neural networks limits the ability of the model to capture global contextual information and comprehensively model tissue composition. The phenotypical and topological distribution of constituent histological entities play a critical role in tissue diagnosis. As such, graph data representations and deep learning have attracted significant attention for encoding tissue representations, and capturing intra- and inter- entity level interactions. In this review, we provide a conceptual grounding for graph analytics in digital pathology, including entity-graph construction and graph architectures, and present their current success for tumor localization and classification, tumor invasion and staging, image retrieval, and survival prediction. We provide an overview of these methods in a systematic manner organized by the graph representation of the input image, scale, and organ on which they operate. We also outline the limitations of existing techniques, and suggest potential future research directions in this domain."
2107.02739,Shapes as Product Differentiation: Neural Network Embedding in the   Analysis of Markets for Fonts,"Many differentiated products have key attributes that are unstructured and thus high-dimensional (e.g., design, text). Instead of treating unstructured attributes as unobservables in economic models, quantifying them can be important to answer interesting economic questions. To propose an analytical framework for these types of products, this paper considers one of the simplest design products-fonts-and investigates merger and product differentiation using an original dataset from the world's largest online marketplace for fonts. We quantify font shapes by constructing embeddings from a deep convolutional neural network. Each embedding maps a font's shape onto a low-dimensional vector. In the resulting product space, designers are assumed to engage in Hotelling-type spatial competition. From the image embeddings, we construct two alternative measures that capture the degree of design differentiation. We then study the causal effects of a merger on the merging firm's creative decisions using the constructed measures in a synthetic control method. We find that the merger causes the merging firm to increase the visual variety of font design. Notably, such effects are not captured when using traditional measures for product offerings (e.g., specifications and the number of products) constructed from structured data."
2107.02791,Depth-supervised NeRF: Fewer Views and Faster Training for Free,"A commonly observed failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is fitting incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as ""free"" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs."
2107.02792,Learned Visual Navigation for Under-Canopy Agricultural Robots,"We describe a system for visually guided autonomous navigation of under-canopy farm robots. Low-cost under-canopy robots can drive between crop rows under the plant canopy and accomplish tasks that are infeasible for over-the-canopy drones or larger agricultural equipment. However, autonomously navigating them under the canopy presents a number of challenges: unreliable GPS and LiDAR, high cost of sensing, challenging farm terrain, clutter due to leaves and weeds, and large variability in appearance over the season and across crop types. We address these challenges by building a modular system that leverages machine learning for robust and generalizable perception from monocular RGB images from low-cost cameras, and model predictive control for accurate control in challenging terrain. Our system, CropFollow, is able to autonomously drive 485 meters per intervention on average, outperforming a state-of-the-art LiDAR based system (286 meters per intervention) in extensive field testing spanning over 25 km."
2107.03024,Rethinking Sampling Strategies for Unsupervised Person Re-identification,"Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) remains a challenging task. While extensive research has focused on the framework design and loss function, this paper shows that sampling strategy plays an equally important role. We analyze the reasons for the performance differences between various sampling strategies under the same framework and loss function. We suggest that deteriorated over-fitting is an important factor causing poor performance, and enhancing statistical stability can rectify this problem. Inspired by that, a simple yet effective approach is proposed, termed group sampling, which gathers samples from the same class into groups. The model is thereby trained using normalized group samples, which helps alleviate the negative impact of individual samples. Group sampling updates the pipeline of pseudo-label generation by guaranteeing that samples are more efficiently classified into the correct classes. It regulates the representation learning process, enhancing statistical stability for feature representation in a progressive fashion. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 show that group sampling achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods and outperforms the current techniques under purely camera-agnostic settings. Code has been available at https://github.com/ucas-vg/GroupSampling."
2107.03331,KOALA: A Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity,"Optimization is often cast as a deterministic problem, where the solution is found through some iterative procedure such as gradient descent. However, when training neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to the randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns the optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss as a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This interpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer, as its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model for the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient dynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic optimization method KOALA, which is short for Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity. KOALA is an easy to implement, scalable, and efficient method to train neural networks. We provide convergence analysis and show experimentally that it yields parameter estimates that are on par with or better than existing state of the art optimization algorithms across several neural network architectures and machine learning tasks, such as computer vision and language modeling."
2107.04589,ViTGAN: Training GANs with Vision Transformers,"Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown competitive performance on image recognition while requiring less vision-specific inductive biases. In this paper, we investigate if such performance can be extended to image generation. To this end, we integrate the ViT architecture into generative adversarial networks (GANs). For ViT discriminators, we observe that existing regularization methods for GANs interact poorly with self-attention, causing serious instability during training. To resolve this issue, we introduce several novel regularization techniques for training GANs with ViTs. For ViT generators, we examine architectural choices for latent and pixel mapping layers to facilitate convergence. Empirically, our approach, named ViTGAN, achieves comparable performance to the leading CNN-based GAN models on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom."
2107.04795,Semi-Supervised Learning with Multi-Head Co-Training,"Co-training, extended from self-training, is one of the frameworks for semi-supervised learning. Without natural split of features, single-view co-training works at the cost of training extra classifiers, where the algorithm should be delicately designed to prevent individual classifiers from collapsing into each other. To remove these obstacles which deter the adoption of single-view co-training, we present a simple and efficient algorithm Multi-Head Co-Training. By integrating base learners into a multi-head structure, the model is in a minimal amount of extra parameters. Every classification head in the unified model interacts with its peers through a ""Weak and Strong Augmentation"" strategy, in which the diversity is naturally brought by the strong data augmentation. Therefore, the proposed method facilitates single-view co-training by 1). promoting diversity implicitly and 2). only requiring a small extra computational overhead. The effectiveness of Multi-Head Co-Training is demonstrated in an empirical study on standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks."
2107.04808,COVID Detection in Chest CTs: Improving the Baseline on COV19-CT-DB,"The paper presents a comparative analysis of three distinct approaches based on deep learning for COVID-19 detection in chest CTs. The first approach is a volumetric one, involving 3D convolutions, while the other two approaches perform at first slice-wise classification and then aggregate the results at the volume level. The experiments are carried on the COV19-CT-DB dataset, with the aim of addressing the challenge raised by the MIA-COV19D Competition within ICCV 2021. Our best results on the validation subset reach a macro-F1 score of 0.92, which improves considerably the baseline score of 0.70 set by the organizers."
2107.05087,Remote Blood Oxygen Estimation From Videos Using Neural Networks,"Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an essential indicator of respiratory functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$ using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on. We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$ measurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand on SpO$_2$ estimation performance."
2107.06463,Learned Image Compression with Gaussian-Laplacian-Logistic Mixture Model   and Concatenated Residual Modules,"Recently deep learning-based image compression methods have achieved significant achievements and gradually outperformed traditional approaches including the latest standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics. Two key components of learned image compression are the entropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding network architectures. Various models have been proposed, such as autoregressive, softmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian. Existing schemes only use one of these models. However, due to the vast diversity of images, it is not optimal to use one model for all images, even different regions within one image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible discretized Gaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent representations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and different regions of one image more accurately and efficiently, given the same complexity. Besides, in the encoding/decoding network design part, we propose a concatenated residual blocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially connected with additional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the learning ability of the network, which can further improve the compression performance. Experimental results using the Kodak, Tecnick-100 and Tecnick-40 datasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms all the leading learning-based methods and existing compression standards including VVC intra coding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in terms of the PSNR and MS-SSIM.

2107.07154,What and When to Look?: Temporal Span Proposal Network for Video   Relation Detection,"Identifying relations between objects is central to understanding the scene. While several works have been proposed for relation modeling in the image domain, there have been many constraints in the video domain due to challenging dynamics of spatio-temporal interactions (e.g., between which objects are there an interaction? when do relations start and end?). To date, two representative methods have been proposed to tackle Video Visual Relation Detection (VidVRD): segment-based and window-based. We first point out limitations of these methods and propose a novel approach named Temporal Span Proposal Network (TSPN). TSPN tells what to look: it sparsifies relation search space by scoring relationness of object pair, i.e., measuring how probable a relation exist. TSPN tells when to look: it simultaneously predicts start-end timestamps (i.e., temporal spans) and categories of the all possible relations by utilizing full video context. These two designs enable a win-win scenario: it accelerates training by 2X or more than existing methods and achieves competitive performance on two VidVRD benchmarks (ImageNet-VidVDR and VidOR). Moreover, comprehensive ablative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Codes are available at https://github.com/sangminwoo/Temporal-Span-Proposal-Network-VidVRD."
2107.07243,"VILENS: Visual, Inertial, Lidar, and Leg Odometry for All-Terrain Legged   Robots","We present visual inertial lidar legged navigation system (VILENS), an odometry system for legged robots based on factor graphs. The key novelty is the tight fusion of four different sensor modalities to achieve reliable operation when the individual sensors would otherwise produce degenerate estimation. To minimize leg odometry drift, we extend the robot's state with a linear velocity bias term, which is estimated online. This bias is observable because of the tight fusion of this preintegrated velocity factor with vision, lidar, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) factors. Extensive experimental validation on different ANYmal quadruped robots is presented, for a total duration of 2 h and 1.8 km traveled. The experiments involved dynamic locomotion over loose rocks, slopes, and mud, which caused challenges such as slippage and terrain deformation. Perceptual challenges included dark and dusty underground caverns, and open and feature-deprived areas. We show an average improvement of 62% translational and 51% rotational errors compared to a state-of-the-art loosely coupled approach. To demonstrate its robustness, VILENS was also integrated with a perceptive controller and a local path planner."
2107.07706,DANCE: DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient Segmentation Model   Training and Inference,"Semantic segmentation for scene understanding is nowadays widely demanded, raising significant challenges for the algorithm efficiency, especially its applications on resource-limited platforms. Current segmentation models are trained and evaluated on massive high-resolution scene images (""data level"") and suffer from the expensive computation arising from the required multi-scale aggregation(""network level""). In both folds, the computational and energy costs in training and inference are notable due to the often desired large input resolutions and heavy computational burden of segmentation models. To this end, we propose DANCE, general automated DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient segmentation model training and inference. Distinct from existing efficient segmentation approaches that focus merely on light-weight network design, DANCE distinguishes itself as an automated simultaneous data-network co-optimization via both input data manipulation and network architecture slimming. Specifically, DANCE integrates automated data slimming which adaptively downsamples/drops input images and controls their corresponding contribution to the training loss guided by the images' spatial complexity. Such a downsampling operation, in addition to slimming down the cost associated with the input size directly, also shrinks the dynamic range of input object and context scales, therefore motivating us to also adaptively slim the network to match the downsampled data. Extensive experiments and ablating studies (on four SOTA segmentation models with three popular segmentation datasets under two training settings) demonstrate that DANCE can achieve ""all-win"" towards efficient segmentation(reduced training cost, less expensive inference, and better mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU))."
2107.08228,Weakly-supervised Part-Attention and Mentored Networks for Vehicle   Re-Identification,"Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) aims to retrieve images with the same vehicle ID across different cameras. Current part-level feature learning methods typically detect vehicle parts via uniform division, outside tools, or attention modeling. However, such part features often require expensive additional annotations and cause sub-optimal performance in case of unreliable part mask predictions. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised Part-Attention Network (PANet) and Part-Mentored Network (PMNet) for Vehicle Re-ID. Firstly, PANet localizes vehicle parts via part-relevant channel recalibration and cluster-based mask generation without vehicle part supervisory information. Secondly, PMNet leverages teacher-student guided learning to distill vehicle part-specific features from PANet and performs multi-scale global-part feature extraction. During inference, PMNet can adaptively extract discriminative part features without part localization by PANet, preventing unstable part mask predictions. We address this Re-ID issue as a multi-task problem and adopt Homoscedastic Uncertainty to learn the optimal weighing of ID losses. Experiments are conducted on two public benchmarks, showing that our approach outperforms recent methods, which require no extra annotations by an average increase of 3.0% in CMC@5 on VehicleID and over 1.4% in mAP on VeRi776. Moreover, our method can extend to the occluded vehicle Re-ID task and exhibits good generalization ability."
2107.09847,CogME: A Cognition-Inspired Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metric for   Story Understanding,"We introduce CogME, a cognition-inspired, multi-dimensional evaluation metric designed for AI models focusing on story understanding. CogME is a framework grounded in human thinking strategies and story elements that involve story understanding. With a specific breakdown of the questions, this approach provides a nuanced assessment revealing not only AI models' particular strengths and weaknesses but also the characteristics of the benchmark dataset. Our case study with the DramaQA dataset demonstrates a refined analysis of the model and the benchmark dataset. We argue the need for metrics based on understanding the nature of tasks and designed to align closely with human cognitive processes. This approach provides insights beyond traditional overall scores and paves the way for more sophisticated AI development targeting higher cognitive functions."
2107.09858,Weighted Intersection over Union (wIoU) for Evaluating Image   Segmentation,"In recent years, many semantic segmentation methods have been proposed to predict label of pixels in the scene. In general, we measure area prediction errors or boundary prediction errors for comparing methods. However, there is no intuitive evaluation metric that evaluates both aspects. In this work, we propose a new evaluation measure called weighted Intersection over Union (wIoU) for semantic segmentation. First, it builds a weight map generated from a boundary distance map, allowing weighted evaluation for each pixel based on a boundary importance factor. The proposed wIoU can evaluate both contour and region by setting a boundary importance factor. We validated the effectiveness of wIoU on a dataset of 33 scenes and demonstrated its flexibility. Using the proposed metric, we expect more flexible and intuitive evaluation in semantic segmentation field are possible."
2107.10981,Score-Based Point Cloud Denoising,"Point clouds acquired from scanning devices are often perturbed by noise, which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set of noise-free samples $p(x)$ convolved with some noise model $n$, leading to $(p * n)(x)$ whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy point cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from $p * n$ via gradient ascent -- iteratively updating each point's position. Since $p * n$ is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural network architecture to estimate the score of $p * n$ given only noisy point clouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under a variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks such as point cloud upsampling. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/luost26/score-denoise}."
2107.11267,Dense Supervision Propagation for Weakly Supervised Semantic   Segmentation on 3D Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation on 3D point clouds is an important task for 3D scene understanding. While dense labeling on 3D data is expensive and time-consuming, only a few works address weakly supervised semantic point cloud segmentation methods to relieve the labeling cost by learning from simpler and cheaper labels. Meanwhile, there are still huge performance gaps between existing weakly supervised methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. In this paper, we train a semantic point cloud segmentation network with only a small portion of points being labeled. We argue that we can better utilize the limited supervision information as we densely propagate the supervision signal from the labeled points to other points within and across the input samples. Specifically, we propose a cross-sample feature reallocating module to transfer similar features and therefore re-route the gradients across two samples with common classes and an intra-sample feature redistribution module to propagate supervision signals on unlabeled points across and within point cloud samples. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets S3DIS and ScanNet. Our weakly supervised method with only 10% and 1% of labels can produce compatible results with the fully supervised counterpart."
2107.12220,Thought Flow Nets: From Single Predictions to Trains of Model Thought,"When humans solve complex problems, they typically create a sequence of ideas (involving an intuitive decision, reflection, error correction, etc.) in order to reach a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. Taking inspiration from Hegel's dialectics, we propose the concept of a thought flow which creates a sequence of predictions. We present a self-correction mechanism that is trained to estimate the model's correctness and performs iterative prediction updates based on the correctness prediction's gradient. We introduce our method at the example of question answering and conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate (i) our method's ability to correct its own predictions and (ii) its potential to notably improve model performances. In addition, we conduct a qualitative analysis of thought flow correction patterns and explore how thought flow predictions affect human users within a crowdsourcing study. We find that (iii) thought flows enable improved user performance and are perceived as more natural, correct, and intelligent as single and/or top-3 predictions."
2107.12815,Adaptive Denoising via GainTuning,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image denoising are usually trained on large datasets. These models achieve the current state of the art, but they have difficulties generalizing when applied to data that deviate from the training distribution. Recent work has shown that it is possible to train denoisers on a single noisy image. These models adapt to the features of the test image, but their performance is limited by the small amount of information used to train them. Here we propose ""GainTuning"", in which CNN models pre-trained on large datasets are adaptively and selectively adjusted for individual test images. To avoid overfitting, GainTuning optimizes a single multiplicative scaling parameter (the ""Gain"") of each channel in the convolutional layers of the CNN. We show that GainTuning improves state-of-the-art CNNs on standard image-denoising benchmarks, boosting their denoising performance on nearly every image in a held-out test set. These adaptive improvements are even more substantial for test images differing systematically from the training data, either in noise level or image type. We illustrate the potential of adaptive denoising in a scientific application, in which a CNN is trained on synthetic data, and tested on real transmission-electron-microscope images. In contrast to the existing methodology, GainTuning is able to faithfully reconstruct the structure of catalytic nanoparticles from these data at extremely low signal-to-noise ratios."
2107.13136,Insights from Generative Modeling for Neural Video Compression,"While recent machine learning research has revealed connections between deep generative models such as VAEs and rate-distortion losses used in learned compression, most of this work has focused on images. In a similar spirit, we view recently proposed neural video coding algorithms through the lens of deep autoregressive and latent variable modeling. We present these codecs as instances of a generalized stochastic temporal autoregressive transform, and propose new avenues for further improvements inspired by normalizing flows and structured priors. We propose several architectures that yield state-of-the-art video compression performance on high-resolution video and discuss their tradeoffs and ablations. In particular, we propose (i) improved temporal autoregressive transforms, (ii) improved entropy models with structured and temporal dependencies, and (iii) variable bitrate versions of our algorithms. Since our improvements are compatible with a large class of existing models, we provide further evidence that the generative modeling viewpoint can advance the neural video coding field."
2107.13429,Task-Specific Normalization for Continual Learning of Blind Image   Quality Models,"In this paper, we present a simple yet effective continual learning method for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) with improved quality prediction accuracy, plasticity-stability trade-off, and task-order/-length robustness. The key step in our approach is to freeze all convolution filters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for an explicit promise of stability, and learn task-specific normalization parameters for plasticity. We assign each new IQA dataset (i.e., task) a prediction head, and load the corresponding normalization parameters to produce a quality score. The final quality estimate is computed by black a weighted summation of predictions from all heads with a lightweight $K$-means gating mechanism. Extensive experiments on six IQA datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in comparison to previous training techniques for BIQA."
2107.13931,Learning Geometry-Guided Depth via Projective Modeling for Monocular 3D   Object Detection,"As a crucial task of autonomous driving, 3D object detection has made great progress in recent years. However, monocular 3D object detection remains a challenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation. Most existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth while ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric elements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In this paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with projective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a principled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth predictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further implement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep representation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting the depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing substantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure robust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of the state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the moderate test setting. The model and code will be released at https://github.com/YinminZhang/MonoGeo."
2108.00394,Deep graph matching meets mixed-integer linear programming: Relax at   your own risk ?,"Graph matching is an important problem that has received widespread attention, especially in the field of computer vision. Recently, state-of-the-art methods seek to incorporate graph matching with deep learning. However, there is no research to explain what role the graph matching algorithm plays in the model. Therefore, we propose an approach integrating a MILP formulation of the graph matching problem. This formulation is solved to optimal and it provides inherent baseline. Meanwhile, similar approaches are derived by releasing the optimal guarantee of the graph matching solver and by introducing a quality level. This quality level controls the quality of the solutions provided by the graph matching solver. In addition, several relaxations of the graph matching problem are put to the test. Our experimental evaluation gives several theoretical insights and guides the direction of deep graph matching methods."
2108.00408,CSC-Unet: A Novel Convolutional Sparse Coding Strategy Based Neural   Network for Semantic Segmentation,"It is a challenging task to accurately perform semantic segmentation due to the complexity of real picture scenes. Many semantic segmentation methods based on traditional deep learning insufficiently captured the semantic and appearance information of images, which put limit on their generality and robustness for various application scenes. In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy that reformulated the popularly-used convolution operation to multi-layer convolutional sparse coding block to ease the aforementioned deficiency. This strategy can be possibly used to significantly improve the segmentation performance of any semantic segmentation model that involves convolutional operations. To prove the effectiveness of our idea, we chose the widely-used U-Net model for the demonstration purpose, and we designed CSC-Unet model series based on U-Net. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we provided credible evidence showing that the multi-layer convolutional sparse coding block enables semantic segmentation model to converge faster, can extract finer semantic and appearance information of images, and improve the ability to recover spatial detail information. The best CSC-Unet model significantly outperforms the results of the original U-Net on three public datasets with different scenarios, i.e., 87.14% vs. 84.71% on DeepCrack dataset, 68.91% vs. 67.09% on Nuclei dataset, and 53.68% vs. 48.82% on CamVid dataset, respectively."
2108.00688,Self-supervised Audiovisual Representation Learning for Remote Sensing   Data,"Many current deep learning approaches make extensive use of backbone networks pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which are then fine-tuned to perform a certain task. In remote sensing, the lack of comparable large annotated datasets and the wide diversity of sensing platforms impedes similar developments. In order to contribute towards the availability of pre-trained backbone networks in remote sensing, we devise a self-supervised approach for pre-training deep neural networks. By exploiting the correspondence between geo-tagged audio recordings and remote sensing imagery, this is done in a completely label-free manner, eliminating the need for laborious manual annotation. For this purpose, we introduce the SoundingEarth dataset, which consists of co-located aerial imagery and audio samples all around the world. Using this dataset, we then pre-train ResNet models to map samples from both modalities into a common embedding space, which encourages the models to understand key properties of a scene that influence both visual and auditory appearance. To validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we evaluate the transfer learning performance of pre-trained weights obtained against weights obtained through other means. By fine-tuning the models on a number of commonly used remote sensing datasets, we show that our approach outperforms existing pre-training strategies for remote sensing imagery. The dataset, code and pre-trained model weights will be available at https://github.com/khdlr/SoundingEarth."
2108.02160,MRI to PET Cross-Modality Translation using Globally and Locally Aware   GAN (GLA-GAN) for Multi-Modal Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Medical imaging datasets are inherently high dimensional with large variability and low sample sizes that limit the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the ability to synthesize realist images have shown great potential as an alternative to standard data augmentation techniques. Our work focuses on cross-modality synthesis of fluorodeoxyglucose~(FDG) Positron Emission Tomography~(PET) scans from structural Magnetic Resonance~(MR) images using generative models to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end, globally and locally aware image-to-image translation GAN (GLA-GAN) with a multi-path architecture that enforces both global structural integrity and fidelity to local details. We further supplement the standard adversarial loss with voxel-level intensity, multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and region-of-interest (ROI) based loss components that reduce reconstruction error, enforce structural consistency at different scales and perceive variation in regional sensitivity to AD respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our GLA-GAN not only generates synthesized FDG-PET scans with enhanced image quality but also superior clinical utility in improving AD diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art models. Finally, we attempt to interpret some of the internal units of the GAN that are closely related to this specific cross-modality generation task."
2108.02562,Evaluation of Audio-Visual Alignments in Visually Grounded Speech Models,"Systems that can find correspondences between multiple modalities, such as between speech and images, have great potential to solve different recognition and data analysis tasks in an unsupervised manner. This work studies multimodal learning in the context of visually grounded speech (VGS) models, and focuses on their recently demonstrated capability to extract spatiotemporal alignments between spoken words and the corresponding visual objects without ever been explicitly trained for object localization or word recognition. As the main contributions, we formalize the alignment problem in terms of an audiovisual alignment tensor that is based on earlier VGS work, introduce systematic metrics for evaluating model performance in aligning visual objects and spoken words, and propose a new VGS model variant for the alignment task utilizing cross-modal attention layer. We test our model and a previously proposed model in the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the semantic retrieval task commonly used to evaluate VGS models. We show that cross-modal attention layer not only helps the model to achieve higher semantic cross-modal retrieval performance, but also leads to substantial improvements in the alignment performance between image object and spoken words."
2108.02759,Unifying Global-Local Representations in Salient Object Detection with   Transformer,"The fully convolutional network (FCN) has dominated salient object detection for a long period. However, the locality of CNN requires the model deep enough to have a global receptive field and such a deep model always leads to the loss of local details. In this paper, we introduce a new attention-based encoder, vision transformer, into salient object detection to ensure the globalization of the representations from shallow to deep layers. With the global view in very shallow layers, the transformer encoder preserves more local representations to recover the spatial details in final saliency maps. Besides, as each layer can capture a global view of its previous layer, adjacent layers can implicitly maximize the representation differences and minimize the redundant features, making that every output feature of transformer layers contributes uniquely for final prediction. To decode features from the transformer, we propose a simple yet effective deeply-transformed decoder. The decoder densely decodes and upsamples the transformer features, generating the final saliency map with less noise injection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other FCN-based and transformer-based methods in five benchmarks by a large margin, with an average of 12.17% improvement in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Code will be available at https://github.com/OliverRensu/GLSTR."
2108.03140,SELM: Siamese Extreme Learning Machine with Application to Face   Biometrics,"Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive existing classification methods. It is extremely fast at training. Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face verification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The structure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for recognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For these reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine (SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra Siamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group. Experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM, Extreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the proposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy and 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the proposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the well-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin."
2108.03151,Full-Duplex Strategy for Video Object Segmentation,"Previous video object segmentation approaches mainly focus on using simplex solutions between appearance and motion, limiting feature collaboration efficiency among and across these two cues. In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network (FSNet) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme between motion and appearance in exploiting the cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce the relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model's robustness and update the inconsistent features from the spatial-temporal embeddings, we adopt the bidirectional purification module (BPM) after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) and achieves favourable performance against existing cutting-edges both in the video object segmentation and video salient object detection tasks. The project is publicly available at: https://dpfan.net/FSNet."
2108.03418,Information Bottleneck Approach to Spatial Attention Learning,"The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS) restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited computational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts as an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git."
2108.03534,Reducing Annotating Load: Active Learning with Synthetic Images in   Surgical Instrument Segmentation,"Accurate instrument segmentation in endoscopic vision of robot-assisted surgery is challenging due to reflection on the instruments and frequent contacts with tissue. Deep neural networks (DNN) show competitive performance and are in favor in recent years. However, the hunger of DNN for labeled data poses a huge workload of annotation. Motivated by alleviating this workload, we propose a general embeddable method to decrease the usage of labeled real images, using active generated synthetic images. In each active learning iteration, the most informative unlabeled images are first queried by active learning and then labeled. Next, synthetic images are generated based on these selected images. The instruments and backgrounds are cropped out and randomly combined with each other with blending and fusion near the boundary. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 2 sinus surgery datasets and 1 intraabdominal surgery dataset. The results indicate a considerable improvement in performance, especially when the budget for annotation is small. The effectiveness of different types of synthetic images, blending methods, and external background are also studied. All the code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HaonanPeng/active_syn_generator."
2108.04091,Zero in on Shape: A Generic 2D-3D Instance Similarity Metric learned   from Synthetic Data,"We present a network architecture which compares RGB images and untextured 3D models by the similarity of the represented shape. Our system is optimised for zero-shot retrieval, meaning it can recognise shapes never shown in training. We use a view-based shape descriptor and a siamese network to learn object geometry from pairs of 3D models and 2D images. Due to scarcity of datasets with exact photograph-mesh correspondences, we train our network with only synthetic data. Our experiments investigate the effect of different qualities and quantities of training data on retrieval accuracy and present insights from bridging the domain gap. We show that increasing the variety of synthetic data improves retrieval accuracy and that our system's performance in zero-shot mode can match that of the instance-aware mode, as far as narrowing down the search to the top 10% of objects."
2108.04186,Pose is all you need: The pose only group activity recognition system   (POGARS),"We introduce a novel deep learning based group activity recognition approach called the Pose Only Group Activity Recognition System (POGARS), designed to use only tracked poses of people to predict the performed group activity. In contrast to existing approaches for group activity recognition, POGARS uses 1D CNNs to learn spatiotemporal dynamics of individuals involved in a group activity and forgo learning features from pixel data. The proposed model uses a spatial and temporal attention mechanism to infer person-wise importance and multi-task learning for simultaneously performing group and individual action classification. Experimental results confirm that POGARS achieves highly competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on a widely used public volleyball dataset despite only using tracked pose as input. Further our experiments show by using pose only as input, POGARS has better generalization capabilities compared to methods that use RGB as input."
2108.05293,Few-Shot Segmentation with Global and Local Contrastive Learning,"In this work, we address the challenging task of few-shot segmentation. Previous few-shot segmentation methods mainly employ the information of support images as guidance for query image segmentation. Although some works propose to build cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of query information still depends on the support images. We here propose to extract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the few-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to learn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed global-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined priors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the prior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to perform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction of query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the limitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve better interaction. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the few-shot segmentation task on PASCAL-5$^{i}$ and COCO datasets."
2108.06009,SAR image matching algorithm based on multi-class features,"Synthetic aperture radar has the ability to work 24/7 and 24/7, and has high application value. Propose a new SAR image matching algorithm based on multi class features, mainly using two different types of features: straight lines and regions to enhance the robustness of the matching algorithm; On the basis of using prior knowledge of images, combined with LSD (Line Segment Detector) line detection and template matching algorithm, by analyzing the attribute correlation between line and surface features in SAR images, selecting line and region features in SAR images to match the images, the matching accuracy between SAR images and visible light images is improved, and the probability of matching errors is reduced. The experimental results have verified that this algorithm can obtain high-precision matching results, achieve precise target positioning, and has good robustness to changes in perspective and lighting. The results are accurate and false positives are controllable."
2108.06073,Coupling Model-Driven and Data-Driven Methods for Remote Sensing Image   Restoration and Fusion,"In the fields of image restoration and image fusion, model-driven methods and data-driven methods are the two representative frameworks. However, both approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The model-driven methods consider the imaging mechanism, which is deterministic and theoretically reasonable; however, they cannot easily model complicated nonlinear problems. The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge learning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical features; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are over-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate the coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been considered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities. We are the first to summarize the coupling approaches into the following three categories: 1) data-driven and model-driven cascading methods; 2) variational models with embedded learning; and 3) model-constrained network learning methods. The typical existing and potential coupling methods for remote sensing image restoration and fusion are introduced with application examples. This paper also gives some new insights into the potential future directions, in terms of both methods and applications."
2108.06181,"Detecting socially interacting groups using f-formation: A survey of   taxonomy, methods, datasets, applications, challenges, and future research   directions","Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality, first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and limitations in current literature along with possible future research directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain."
2108.06545,PICCOLO: Point Cloud-Centric Omnidirectional Localization,"We present PICCOLO, a simple and efficient algorithm for omnidirectional localization. Given a colored point cloud and a 360 panorama image of a scene, our objective is to recover the camera pose at which the panorama image is taken. Our pipeline works in an off-the-shelf manner with a single image given as a query and does not require any training of neural networks or collecting ground-truth poses of images. Instead, we match each point cloud color to the holistic view of the panorama image with gradient-descent optimization to find the camera pose. Our loss function, called sampling loss, is point cloud-centric, evaluated at the projected location of every point in the point cloud. In contrast, conventional photometric loss is image-centric, comparing colors at each pixel location. With a simple change in the compared entities, sampling loss effectively overcomes the severe visual distortion of omnidirectional images, and enjoys the global context of the 360 view to handle challenging scenarios for visual localization. PICCOLO outperforms existing omnidirectional localization algorithms in both accuracy and stability when evaluated in various environments.

2108.06663,HCR-Net: A deep learning based script independent handwritten character   recognition network,"Handwritten character recognition (HCR) remains a challenging pattern recognition problem despite decades of research, and lacks research on script independent recognition techniques. {\color{black}This is mainly because of similar character structures, different handwriting styles, diverse scripts, handcrafted feature extraction techniques, unavailability of data and code, and the development of script-specific deep learning techniques. To address these limitations, we have proposed a script independent deep learning network for HCR research, called HCR-Net, that sets a new research direction for the field. HCR-Net is based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, which \textit{partly utilizes} feature extraction layers of a pre-trained network.} Due to transfer learning and image augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster and computationally efficient training, better performance and generalizations, and can work with small datasets. HCR-Net is extensively evaluated on 40 publicly available datasets of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages, and established 26 new benchmark results while performed close to the best results in the rest cases. HCR-Net showed performance improvements up to 11\% against the existing results and achieved a fast convergence rate showing up to 99\% of final performance in the very first epoch. HCR-Net significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques and also reduced the number of trainable parameters by 34\% as compared with the corresponding pre-trained network. To facilitate reproducibility and further advancements of HCR research, the complete code is publicly released at \url{https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/HCR-Net}."
2108.06932,Polyp-PVT: Polyp Segmentation with Pyramid Vision Transformers,"Most polyp segmentation methods use CNNs as their backbone, leading to two key issues when exchanging information between the encoder and decoder: 1) taking into account the differences in contribution between different-level features and 2) designing an effective mechanism for fusing these features. Unlike existing CNN-based methods, we adopt a transformer encoder, which learns more powerful and robust representations. In addition, considering the image acquisition influence and elusive properties of polyps, we introduce three standard modules, including a cascaded fusion module (CFM), a camouflage identification module (CIM), and a similarity aggregation module (SAM). Among these, the CFM is used to collect the semantic and location information of polyps from high-level features; the CIM is applied to capture polyp information disguised in low-level features, and the SAM extends the pixel features of the polyp area with high-level semantic position information to the entire polyp area, thereby effectively fusing cross-level features. The proposed model, named Polyp-PVT, effectively suppresses noises in the features and significantly improves their expressive capabilities. Extensive experiments on five widely adopted datasets show that the proposed model is more robust to various challenging situations (e.g., appearance changes, small objects, rotation) than existing representative methods. The proposed model is available at https://github.com/DengPingFan/Polyp-PVT."
2108.07554,KCNet: An Insect-Inspired Single-Hidden-Layer Neural Network with   Randomized Binary Weights for Prediction and Classification Tasks,"Fruit flies are established model systems for studying olfactory learning as they will readily learn to associate odors with both electric shock or sugar rewards. The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor learning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are received by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of each odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these glomeruli then projects its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000 so-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom body (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neutrophils that decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown that there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and thus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to fingerprints--even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging insights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural network that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input layer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden layer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization algorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural limits by searching for a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception tasks that predict the perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet outperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For image classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation methods or convolutional layers and shows a particularly fast running time."
2108.08158,Practical X-ray Gastric Cancer Diagnostic Support Using Refined   Stochastic Data Augmentation and Hard Boundary Box Training,"Endoscopy is widely used to diagnose gastric cancer and has a high diagnostic performance, but it must be performed by a physician, which limits the number of people who can be diagnosed. In contrast, gastric X-rays can be taken by radiographers, thus allowing a much larger number of patients to undergo imaging. However, the diagnosis of X-ray images relies heavily on the expertise and experience of physicians, and few machine learning methods have been developed to assist in this process. We propose a novel and practical gastric cancer diagnostic support system for gastric X-ray images that will enable more people to be screened. The system is based on a general deep learning-based object detection model and incorporates two novel techniques: refined probabilistic stomach image augmentation (R-sGAIA) and hard boundary box training (HBBT). R-sGAIA enhances the probabilistic gastric fold region and provides more learning patterns for cancer detection models. HBBT is an efficient training method that improves model performance by allowing the use of unannotated negative (i.e., healthy control) samples, which are typically unusable in conventional detection models. The proposed system achieved a sensitivity (SE) for gastric cancer of 90.2\%, higher than that of an expert (85.5%). Under these conditions, two out of five candidate boxes identified by the system were cancerous (precision = 42.5%), with an image processing speed of 0.51 seconds per image. The system also outperformed methods using the same object detection model and state-of-the-art data augmentation by showing a 5.9-point improvement in the F1 score. In summary, this system efficiently identifies areas for radiologists to examine within a practical time frame, thus significantly reducing their workload."
2108.08532,An Information Theory-inspired Strategy for Automatic Network Pruning,"Despite superior performance on many computer vision tasks, deep convolution neural networks are well known to be compressed on devices that have resource constraints. Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human efforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints are changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when the model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing methods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper we propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model compression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck theory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each other. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer importance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC indicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into a linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is easily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also provide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC simultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers. Without any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs comparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with ResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Codes are avaliable at https://github.com/MAC-AutoML/ITPruner/tree/master."
2108.08618,An automated machine learning framework to optimize radiomics model   construction validated on twelve clinical applications,"Predicting clinical outcomes from medical images using quantitative features (``radiomics'') requires many method design choices, Currently, in new clinical applications, finding the optimal radiomics method out of the wide range of methods relies on a manual, heuristic trial-and-error process. We introduce a novel automated framework that optimizes radiomics workflow construction per application by standardizing the radiomics workflow in modular components, including a large collection of algorithms for each component, and formulating a combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem. To solve it, we employ automated machine learning through two strategies (random search and Bayesian optimization) and three ensembling approaches. Results show that a medium-sized random search and straight-forward ensembling perform similar to more advanced methods while being more efficient. Validated across twelve clinical applications, our approach outperforms both a radiomics baseline and human experts. Concluding, our framework improves and streamlines radiomics research by fully automatically optimizing radiomics workflow construction. To facilitate reproducibility, we publicly release six datasets, software of the method, and code to reproduce this study."
2108.09674,Detection and Localization of Multiple Image Splicing Using MobileNet V1,"In modern society, digital images have become a prominent source of information and medium of communication. They can, however, be simply altered using freely available image editing software. Two or more images are combined to generate a new image that can transmit information across social media platforms to influence the people in the society. This information may have both positive and negative consequences. Hence there is a need to develop a technique that will detect and locates a multiple image splicing forgery in an image. This research work proposes multiple image splicing forgery detection using Mask R-CNN, with a backbone as a MobileNet V1. It also calculates the percentage score of a forged region of multiple spliced images. The comparative analysis of the proposed work with the variants of ResNet is performed. The proposed model is trained and tested using our MISD (Multiple Image Splicing Dataset), and it is observed that the proposed model outperforms the variants of ResNet models (ResNet 51,101 and 151)."
2108.09760,Image Inpainting via Conditional Texture and Structure Dual Generation,"Deep generative approaches have recently made considerable progress in image inpainting by introducing structure priors. Due to the lack of proper interaction with image texture during structure reconstruction, however, current solutions are incompetent in handling the cases with large corruptions, and they generally suffer from distorted results. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network for image inpainting, which models the structure-constrained texture synthesis and texture-guided structure reconstruction in a coupled manner so that they better leverage each other for more plausible generation. Furthermore, to enhance the global consistency, a Bi-directional Gated Feature Fusion (Bi-GFF) module is designed to exchange and combine the structure and texture information and a Contextual Feature Aggregation (CFA) module is developed to refine the generated contents by region affinity learning and multi-scale feature aggregation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the CelebA, Paris StreetView and Places2 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiefan-Guo/CTSDG."
2108.10201,Improving generative adversarial network inversion via fine-tuning GAN   encoders,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can synthesize high-quality (HQ) images, and GAN inversion is a technique that discovers how to invert given images back to latent space. While existing methods perform on StyleGAN inversion, they have limited performance and are not generalized to different GANs. To address these issues, we proposed a self-supervised method to pre-train and fine-tune GAN encoders. First, we designed an adaptive block to fit different encoder architectures for inverting diverse GANs. Then we pre-train GAN encoders using synthesized images and emphasize local regions through cropping images. Finally, we fine-tune the pre-trained GAN encoder for inverting real images. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved better results that reconstructed high-quality images on mainstream GANs. Our code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/disanda/Deep-GAN-Encoders."
2108.10282,ChiNet: Deep Recurrent Convolutional Learning for Multimodal Spacecraft   Pose Estimation,"This paper presents an innovative deep learning pipeline which estimates the relative pose of a spacecraft by incorporating the temporal information from a rendezvous sequence. It leverages the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) units in modelling sequences of data for the processing of features extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. Three distinct training strategies, which follow a coarse-to-fine funnelled approach, are combined to facilitate feature learning and improve end-to-end pose estimation by regression. The capability of CNNs to autonomously ascertain feature representations from images is exploited to fuse thermal infrared data with red-green-blue (RGB) inputs, thus mitigating the effects of artefacts from imaging space objects in the visible wavelength. Each contribution of the proposed framework, dubbed ChiNet, is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, and the complete pipeline is validated on experimental data."
2108.11986,Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging -- A Mini Review,"The increasing digitization of medical imaging enables machine learning based improvements in detecting, visualizing and segmenting lesions, easing the workload for medical experts. However, supervised machine learning requires reliable labelled data, which is is often difficult or impossible to collect or at least time consuming and thereby costly. Therefore methods requiring only partly labeled data (semi-supervised) or no labeling at all (unsupervised methods) have been applied more regularly. Anomaly detection is one possible methodology that is able to leverage semi-supervised and unsupervised methods to handle medical imaging tasks like classification and segmentation. This paper uses a semi-exhaustive literature review of relevant anomaly detection papers in medical imaging to cluster into applications, highlight important results, establish lessons learned and give further advice on how to approach anomaly detection in medical imaging. The qualitative analysis is based on google scholar and 4 different search terms, resulting in 120 different analysed papers. The main results showed that the current research is mostly motivated by reducing the need for labelled data. Also, the successful and substantial amount of research in the brain MRI domain shows the potential for applications in further domains like OCT and chest X-ray."
2108.12056,Continual learning under domain transfer with sparse synaptic bursting,"Existing machines are functionally specific tools that were made for easy prediction and control. Tomorrow's machines may be closer to biological systems in their mutability, resilience, and autonomy. But first they must be capable of learning and retaining new information without being exposed to it arbitrarily often. Past efforts to engineer such systems have sought to build or regulate artificial neural networks using disjoint sets of weights that are uniquely sensitive to specific tasks or inputs. This has not yet enabled continual learning over long sequences of previously unseen data without corrupting existing knowledge: a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce a system that can learn sequentially over previously unseen datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100) with little forgetting over time. This is done by controlling the activity of weights in a convolutional neural network on the basis of inputs using top-down regulation generated by a second feed-forward neural network. We find that our method learns continually under domain transfer with sparse bursts of activity in weights that are recycled across tasks, rather than by maintaining task-specific modules. Sparse synaptic bursting is found to balance activity and suppression such that new functions can be learned without corrupting extant knowledge, thus mirroring the balance of order and disorder in systems at the edge of chaos. This behavior emerges during a prior pre-training (or 'meta-learning') phase in which regulated synapses are selectively disinhibited, or grown, from an initial state of uniform suppression through prediction error minimization."
2108.12943,Growing Cosine Unit: A Novel Oscillatory Activation Function That Can   Speedup Training and Reduce Parameters in Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional neural networks have been successful in solving many socially important and economically significant problems. This ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions hierarchically can be attributed to the use of nonlinear activation functions. A key discovery that made training deep networks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using saturating activation functions. Since then, many improved variants of the ReLU activation have been proposed. However, a majority of activation functions used today are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological plausibility. This paper demonstrates that oscillatory activation functions can improve gradient flow and reduce network size. Two theorems on limits of non-oscillatory activation functions are presented. A new oscillatory activation function called Growing Cosine Unit(GCU) defined as $C(z) = z\cos z$ that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a variety of architectures and benchmarks is presented. The GCU activation has multiple zeros enabling single GCU neurons to have multiple hyperplanes in the decision boundary. This allows single GCU neurons to learn the XOR function without feature engineering. Experimental results indicate that replacing the activation function in the convolution layers with the GCU activation function significantly improves performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Imagenette."
2108.13969,Semi-Supervised Crowd Counting from Unlabeled Data,"Automatic Crowd behavior analysis can be applied to effectively help the daily transportation statistics and planning, which helps the smart city construction. As one of the most important keys, crowd counting has drawn increasing attention. Recent works achieved promising performance but relied on the supervised paradigm with expensive crowd annotations. To alleviate the annotation cost in real-world transportation scenarios, in this work we proposed a semi-supervised learning framework $S^{4}\textit{Crowd}$, which can leverage both unlabeled/labeled data for robust crowd counting. In the unsupervised pathway, two \textit{self-supervised losses} were proposed to simulate the crowd variations such as scale, illumination, based on which supervised information pseudo labels were generated and gradually refined. We also proposed a crowd-driven recurrent unit \textit{Gated-Crowd-Recurrent-Unit (GCRU)}, which can preserve discriminant crowd information by extracting second-order statistics, yielding pseudo labels with improved quality. A joint loss including both unsupervised/supervised information was proposed, and a dynamic weighting strategy was employed to balance the importance of the unsupervised loss and supervised loss at different training stages. We conducted extensive experiments on four popular crowd counting datasets in semi-supervised settings. Experimental results supported the effectiveness of each proposed component in our $S^{4}$Crowd framework. Our method achieved competitive performance in semi-supervised learning approaches on these crowd counting datasets."
2109.00115,Deep Learning with Uncertainty Quantification for Predicting the   Segmentation Dice Coefficient of Prostate Cancer Biopsy Images,"Deep learning models (DLMs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance in histopathology image segmentation and classification, but have limited deployment potential in real-world clinical settings. Uncertainty estimates of DLMs can increase trust by identifying predictions and images that need further review. Dice scores and coefficients (Dice) are benchmarks for evaluation of image segmentation performance, but are usually not evaluated with DLM uncertainty quantification. This study reports DLMs trained with uncertainty estimations, using randomly initialized weights and Monte Carlo dropout, to segment tumors from microscopic Hematoxylin and Eosin dye stained prostate core biopsy histology RGB images. Image-level maps showed significant correlation (Spearman's rank, p < 0.05) between overall and specific prostate tissue image sub-region uncertainties with model performance estimations by Dice. This study reports that linear models, which can predict Dice segmentation scores from multiple clinical sub-region-based uncertainties of prostate cancer, can serve as a more comprehensive performance evaluation metric without loss in predictive capability of DLMs, with a low root mean square error."
2109.00400,An Integrated Framework for the Heterogeneous Spatio-Spectral-Temporal   Fusion of Remote Sensing Images,"Image fusion technology is widely used to fuse the complementary information between multi-source remote sensing images. Inspired by the frontier of deep learning, this paper first proposes a heterogeneous-integrated framework based on a novel deep residual cycle GAN. The proposed network consists of a forward fusion part and a backward degeneration feedback part. The forward part generates the desired fusion result from the various observations; the backward degeneration feedback part considers the imaging degradation process and regenerates the observations inversely from the fusion result. The proposed network can effectively fuse not only the homogeneous but also the heterogeneous information. In addition, for the first time, a heterogeneous-integrated fusion framework is proposed to simultaneously merge the complementary heterogeneous spatial, spectral and temporal information of multi-source heterogeneous observations. The proposed heterogeneous-integrated framework also provides a uniform mode that can complete various fusion tasks, including heterogeneous spatio-spectral fusion, spatio-temporal fusion, and heterogeneous spatio-spectral-temporal fusion. Experiments are conducted for two challenging scenarios of land cover changes and thick cloud coverage. Images from many remote sensing satellites, including MODIS, Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2, are utilized in the experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method."
2109.00456,Weakly-Supervised Surface Crack Segmentation by Generating Pseudo-Labels   using Localization with a Classifier and Thresholding,"Surface cracks are a common sight on public infrastructure nowadays. Recent work has been addressing this problem by supporting structural maintenance measures using machine learning methods. Those methods are used to segment surface cracks from their background, making them easier to localize. However, a common issue is that to create a well-functioning algorithm, the training data needs to have detailed annotations of pixels that belong to cracks. Our work proposes a weakly supervised approach that leverages a CNN classifier in a novel way to create surface crack pseudo labels. First, we use the classifier to create a rough crack localization map by using its class activation maps and a patch based classification approach and fuse this with a thresholding based approach to segment the mostly darker crack pixels. The classifier assists in suppressing noise from the background regions, which commonly are incorrectly highlighted as cracks by standard thresholding methods. Then, the pseudo labels can be used in an end-to-end approach when training a standard CNN for surface crack segmentation. Our method is shown to yield sufficiently accurate pseudo labels. Those labels, incorporated into segmentation CNN training using multiple recent crack segmentation architectures, achieve comparable performance to fully supervised methods on four popular crack segmentation datasets."
2109.00768,Direct PET Image Reconstruction Incorporating Deep Image Prior and a   Forward Projection Model,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. In particular, CNN-based direct PET image reconstruction, which directly generates the reconstructed image from the sinogram, has potential applicability to PET image enhancements because it does not require image reconstruction algorithms, which often produce some artifacts. However, these deep learning-based, direct PET image reconstruction algorithms have the disadvantage that they require a large number of high-quality training datasets. In this study, we propose an unsupervised direct PET image reconstruction method that incorporates a deep image prior framework. Our proposed method incorporates a forward projection model with a loss function to achieve unsupervised direct PET image reconstruction from sinograms. To compare our proposed direct reconstruction method with the filtered back projection (FBP) and maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) algorithms, we evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation data of brain [$^{18}$F]FDG PET scans. The results demonstrate that our proposed direct reconstruction quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms the FBP and ML-EM algorithms with respect to peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index."
2109.01123,Benchmarking the Robustness of Instance Segmentation Models,"This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of instance segmentation models with respect to real-world image corruptions as well as out-of-domain image collections, e.g. images captured by a different set-up than the training dataset. The out-of-domain image evaluation shows the generalization capability of models, an essential aspect of real-world applications and an extensively studied topic of domain adaptation. These presented robustness and generalization evaluations are important when designing instance segmentation models for real-world applications and picking an off-the-shelf pretrained model to directly use for the task at hand. Specifically, this benchmark study includes state-of-the-art network architectures, network backbones, normalization layers, models trained starting from scratch versus pretrained networks, and the effect of multi-task training on robustness and generalization. Through this study, we gain several insights. For example, we find that group normalization enhances the robustness of networks across corruptions where the image contents stay the same but corruptions are added on top. On the other hand, batch normalization improves the generalization of the models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image resolutions than their training size. On the other hand, multi-stage detectors can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive study will motivate the development of more robust and reliable instance segmentation models."
2109.03027,Statistical analysis of locally parameterized shapes,"The alignment of shapes has been a crucial step in statistical shape analysis, for example, in calculating mean shape, detecting locational differences between two shape populations, and classification. Procrustes alignment is the most commonly used method and state of the art. In this work, we uncover that alignment might seriously affect the statistical analysis. For example, alignment can induce false shape differences and lead to misleading results and interpretations. We propose a novel hierarchical shape parameterization based on local coordinate systems. The local parameterized shapes are translation and rotation invariant. Thus, the inherent alignment problems from the commonly used global coordinate system for shape representation can be avoided using this parameterization. The new parameterization is also superior for shape deformation and simulation. The method's power is demonstrated on the hypothesis testing of simulated data as well as the left hippocampi of patients with Parkinson's disease and controls."
2109.04569,Open-World Distributed Robot Self-Localization with Transferable Visual   Vocabulary and Both Absolute and Relative Features,"Visual robot self-localization is a fundamental problem in visual robot navigation and has been studied across various problem settings, including monocular and sequential localization. However, many existing studies focus primarily on single-robot scenarios, with limited exploration into general settings involving diverse robots connected through wireless networks with constrained communication capacities, such as open-world distributed robot systems. In particular, issues related to the transfer and sharing of key knowledge, such as visual descriptions and visual vocabulary, between robots have been largely neglected. This work introduces a new self-localization framework designed for open-world distributed robot systems that maintains state-of-the-art performance while offering two key advantages: (1) it employs an unsupervised visual vocabulary model that maps to multimodal, lightweight, and transferable visual features, and (2) the visual vocabulary itself is a lightweight and communication-friendly model. Although the primary focus is on encoding monocular view images, the framework can be easily extended to sequential localization applications. By utilizing complementary similarity-preserving features -- both absolute and relative -- the framework meets the requirements for being unsupervised, multimodal, lightweight, and transferable. All features are learned and recognized using a lightweight graph neural network and scene graph. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in both passive and active self-localization scenarios."
2109.04993,LAViTeR: Learning Aligned Visual and Textual Representations Assisted by   Image and Caption Generation,"Pre-training visual and textual representations from large-scale image-text pairs is becoming a standard approach for many downstream vision-language tasks. The transformer-based models learn inter and intra-modal attention through a list of self-supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes LAViTeR, a novel architecture for visual and textual representation learning. The main module, Visual Textual Alignment (VTA) will be assisted by two auxiliary tasks, GAN-based image synthesis and Image Captioning. We also propose a new evaluation metric measuring the similarity between the learnt visual and textual embedding. The experimental results on two public datasets, CUB and MS-COCO, demonstrate superior visual and textual representation alignment in the joint feature embedding space"
2109.05021,A Deep Learning-Based Unified Framework for Red Lesions Detection on   Retinal Fundus Images,"Red-lesions, microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HMs), are the early signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The automatic detection of MAs and HMs on retinal fundus images is a challenging task. Most of the existing methods detect either only MAs or only HMs because of the difference in their texture, sizes, and morphology. Though some methods detect both MAs and HMs, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality of shape and colors features and fail to detect all shape variations of HMs such as flame-shaped. Leveraging the progress in deep learning, we proposed a two-stream red lesions detection system dealing simultaneously with small and large red lesions. For this system, we introduced a new ROIs candidates generation method for large red lesions on fundus images; it is based on blood vessel segmentation and morphological operations, and reduces the computational complexity, and enhances the detection accuracy by generating a small number of potential candidates. For detection, we proposed a framework with two streams. We used pretrained VGGNet as a backbone model and carried out several extensive experiments to tune it for vessels segmentation and candidates generation, and finally learning the appropriate mapping, which yields better detection of the red lesions comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results validated the effectiveness of the system in the detection of both MAs and HMs; it yields higher performance for per lesion detection; its sensitivity equals 0.8589 and good FROC score under 8 FPIs on DiaretDB1-MA reports FROC=0.7518, and with SN=0.7552 and good FROC score under 2,4and 8 FPIs on DiaretDB1-HM, and SN=0.8157 on e-ophtha with overall FROC=0.4537 and on ROCh dataset with FROC=0.3461 which is higher than the state-of-the art methods. For DR screening, the system performs well with good AUC on DiaretDB1-MA, DiaretDB1-HM, and e-ophtha datasets."
2109.05206,PHPQ: Pyramid Hybrid Pooling Quantization for Efficient Fine-Grained   Image Retrieval,"Deep hashing approaches, including deep quantization and deep binary hashing, have become a common solution to large-scale image retrieval due to their high computation and storage efficiency. Most existing hashing methods cannot produce satisfactory results for fine-grained retrieval, because they usually adopt the outputs of the last CNN layer to generate binary codes. Since deeper layers tend to summarize visual clues, e.g., texture, into abstract semantics, e.g., dogs and cats, the feature produced by the last CNN layer is less effective in capturing subtle but discriminative visual details that mostly exist in shallow layers. To improve fine-grained image hashing, we propose Pyramid Hybrid Pooling Quantization (PHPQ). Specifically, we propose a Pyramid Hybrid Pooling (PHP) module to capture and preserve fine-grained semantic information from multi-level features, which emphasizes the subtle discrimination of different sub-categories. Besides, we propose a learnable quantization module with a partial codebook attention mechanism, which helps to optimize the most relevant codewords and improves the quantization. Comprehensive experiments on two widely-used public benchmarks, i.e., CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that PHPQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2109.05751,Adversarially Trained Object Detector for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation, which involves transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, can be used to substantially reduce annotation costs in the field of object detection. In this study, we demonstrate that adversarial training in the source domain can be employed as a new approach for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we establish that adversarially trained detectors achieve improved detection performance in target domains that are significantly shifted from source domains. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that adversarially trained detectors can be used to extract robust features that are in alignment with human perception and worth transferring across domains while discarding domain-specific non-robust features. In addition, we propose a method that combines adversarial training and feature alignment to ensure the improved alignment of robust features with the target domain. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach on large domain shifts from real to artistic images. Compared to the baseline models, the adversarially trained detectors improve the mean average precision by up to 7.7%, and further by up to 11.8% when feature alignments are incorporated. Although our method degrades performance for small domain shifts, quantification of the domain shift based on the Frechet distance allows us to determine whether adversarial training should be conducted."
2109.06098,The mathematics of adversarial attacks in AI -- Why deep learning is   unstable despite the existence of stable neural networks,"The unprecedented success of deep learning (DL) makes it unchallenged when it comes to classification problems. However, it is well established that the current DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast literature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for stability.   Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2."
2109.06116,Blood vessel segmentation in en-face OCTA images: a frequency based   method,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel noninvasive imaging modality for visualization of retinal blood flow in the human retina. Using specific OCTA imaging biomarkers for the identification of pathologies, automated image segmentations of the blood vessels can improve subsequent analysis and diagnosis. We present a novel segmentation method for vessel density identification based on frequency representations of the image, in particular, using so-called Gabor filter banks. The algorithm is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on an OCTA image in-house data set from $10$ eyes acquired by a Cirrus HD-OCT device. Qualitatively, the segmentation outcomes received very good visual evaluation feedback by experts. Quantitatively, we compared the resulting vessel density values with automated in-built values provided by the device. The results underline the visual evaluation. For the evaluation of the FAZ identification substep, manual annotations of $2$ expert graders were used, showing that our results coincide well in visual and quantitative manners. Lastly, we suggest the computation of adaptive local vessel density maps that allow straightforward analysis of retinal blood flow in a local manner."
2109.06590,High-Fidelity GAN Inversion for Image Attribute Editing,"We present a novel high-fidelity generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion framework that enables attribute editing with image-specific details well-preserved (e.g., background, appearance, and illumination). We first analyze the challenges of high-fidelity GAN inversion from the perspective of lossy data compression. With a low bit-rate latent code, previous works have difficulties in preserving high-fidelity details in reconstructed and edited images. Increasing the size of a latent code can improve the accuracy of GAN inversion but at the cost of inferior editability. To improve image fidelity without compromising editability, we propose a distortion consultation approach that employs a distortion map as a reference for high-fidelity reconstruction. In the distortion consultation inversion (DCI), the distortion map is first projected to a high-rate latent map, which then complements the basic low-rate latent code with more details via consultation fusion. To achieve high-fidelity editing, we propose an adaptive distortion alignment (ADA) module with a self-supervised training scheme, which bridges the gap between the edited and inversion images. Extensive experiments in the face and car domains show a clear improvement in both inversion and editing quality."
2109.07078,DSOR: A Scalable Statistical Filter for Removing Falling Snow from LiDAR   Point Clouds in Severe Winter Weather,"For autonomous vehicles to viably replace human drivers they must contend with inclement weather. Falling rain and snow introduce noise in LiDAR returns resulting in both false positive and false negative object detections. In this article we introduce the Winter Adverse Driving dataSet (WADS) collected in the snow belt region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. WADS is the first multi-modal dataset featuring dense point-wise labeled sequential LiDAR scans collected in severe winter weather; weather that would cause an experienced driver to alter their driving behavior. We have labelled and will make available over 7 GB or 3.6 billion labelled LiDAR points out of over 26 TB of total LiDAR and camera data collected. We also present the Dynamic Statistical Outlier Removal (DSOR) filter, a statistical PCL-based filter capable or removing snow with a higher recall than the state of the art snow de-noising filter while being 28\% faster. Further, the DSOR filter is shown to have a lower time complexity compared to the state of the art resulting in an improved scalability.   Our labeled dataset and DSOR filter will be made available at https://bitbucket.org/autonomymtu/dsor_filter"
2109.07165,3D Annotation Of Arbitrary Objects In The Wild,"Recent years have produced a variety of learning based methods in the context of computer vision and robotics. Most of the recently proposed methods are based on deep learning, which require very large amounts of data compared to traditional methods. The performance of the deep learning methods are largely dependent on the data distribution they were trained on, and it is important to use data from the robot's actual operating domain during training. Therefore, it is not possible to rely on pre-built, generic datasets when deploying robots in real environments, creating a need for efficient data collection and annotation in the specific operating conditions the robots will operate in. The challenge is then: how do we reduce the cost of obtaining such datasets to a point where we can easily deploy our robots in new conditions, environments and to support new sensors? As an answer to this question, we propose a data annotation pipeline based on SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and 3D-to-2D geometry. The pipeline allows creating 3D and 2D bounding boxes, along with per-pixel annotations of arbitrary objects without needing accurate 3D models of the objects prior to data collection and annotation. Our results showcase almost 90% Intersection-over-Union (IoU) agreement on both semantic segmentation and 2D bounding box detection across a variety of objects and scenes, while speeding up the annotation process by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional manual annotation."
2109.08123,Neural \'{E}tendue Expander for Ultra-Wide-Angle High-Fidelity   Holographic Display,"Holographic displays can generate light fields by dynamically modulating the wavefront of a coherent beam of light using a spatial light modulator, promising rich virtual and augmented reality applications. However, the limited spatial resolution of existing dynamic spatial light modulators imposes a tight bound on the diffraction angle. As a result, modern holographic displays possess low \'{e}tendue, which is the product of the display area and the maximum solid angle of diffracted light. The low \'{e}tendue forces a sacrifice of either the field-of-view (FOV) or the display size. In this work, we lift this limitation by presenting neural \'{e}tendue expanders. This new breed of optical elements, which is learned from a natural image dataset, enables higher diffraction angles for ultra-wide FOV while maintaining both a compact form factor and the fidelity of displayed contents to human viewers. With neural \'{e}tendue expanders, we experimentally achieve 64$\times$ \'{e}tendue expansion of natural images in full color, expanding the FOV by an order of magnitude horizontally and vertically, with high-fidelity reconstruction quality (measured in PSNR) over 29 dB on retinal-resolution images."
2109.08247,Towards agricultural autonomy: crop row detection under varying field   conditions using deep learning,"This paper presents a novel metric to evaluate the robustness of deep learning based semantic segmentation approaches for crop row detection under different field conditions encountered by a field robot. A dataset with ten main categories encountered under various field conditions was used for testing. The effect on these conditions on the angular accuracy of crop row detection was compared. A deep convolutional encoder decoder network is implemented to predict crop row masks using RGB input images. The predicted mask is then sent to a post processing algorithm to extract the crop rows. The deep learning model was found to be robust against shadows and growth stages of the crop while the performance was reduced under direct sunlight, increasing weed density, tramlines and discontinuities in crop rows when evaluated with the novel metric."
2109.08411,Cross Modification Attention Based Deliberation Model for Image   Captioning,"The conventional encoder-decoder framework for image captioning generally adopts a single-pass decoding process, which predicts the target descriptive sentence word by word in temporal order. Despite the great success of this framework, it still suffers from two serious disadvantages. Firstly, it is unable to correct the mistakes in the predicted words, which may mislead the subsequent prediction and result in error accumulation problem. Secondly, such a framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible future words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic information. To overcome these limitations, we explore a universal two-pass decoding framework, where a single-pass decoding based model serving as the Drafting Model first generates a draft caption according to an input image, and a Deliberation Model then performs the polishing process to refine the draft caption to a better image description. Furthermore, inspired from the complementarity between different modalities, we propose a novel Cross Modification Attention (CMA) module to enhance the semantic expression of the image features and filter out error information from the draft captions. We integrate CMA with the decoder of our Deliberation Model and name it as Cross Modification Attention based Deliberation Model (CMA-DM). We train our proposed framework by jointly optimizing all trainable components from scratch with a trade-off coefficient. Experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our approach obtains significant improvements over single-pass decoding baselines and achieves competitive performances compared with other state-of-the-art two-pass decoding based methods."
2109.08730,Unsupervised View-Invariant Human Posture Representation,"Most recent view-invariant action recognition and performance assessment approaches rely on a large amount of annotated 3D skeleton data to extract view-invariant features. However, acquiring 3D skeleton data can be cumbersome, if not impractical, in in-the-wild scenarios. To overcome this problem, we present a novel unsupervised approach that learns to extract view-invariant 3D human pose representation from a 2D image without using 3D joint data. Our model is trained by exploiting the intrinsic view-invariant properties of human pose between simultaneous frames from different viewpoints and their equivariant properties between augmented frames from the same viewpoint. We evaluate the learned view-invariant pose representations for two downstream tasks. We perform comparative experiments that show improvements on the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-view action classification accuracy on NTU RGB+D by a significant margin, on both RGB and depth images. We also show the efficiency of transferring the learned representations from NTU RGB+D to obtain the first ever unsupervised cross-view and cross-subject rank correlation results on the multi-view human movement quality dataset, QMAR, and marginally improve on the-state-of-the-art supervised results for this dataset. We also carry out ablation studies to examine the contributions of the different components of our proposed network."
2109.08843,Memory Regulation and Alignment toward Generalizer RGB-Infrared Person,"The domain shift, coming from unneglectable modality gap and non-overlapped identity classes between training and test sets, is a major issue of RGB-Infrared person re-identification. A key to tackle the inherent issue -- domain shift -- is to enforce the data distributions of the two domains to be similar. However, RGB-IR ReID always demands discriminative features, leading to over-rely feature sensitivity of seen classes, \textit{e.g.}, via attention-based feature alignment or metric learning. Therefore, predicting the unseen query category from predefined training classes may not be accurate and leads to a sub-optimal adversarial gradient. In this paper, we uncover it in a more explainable way and propose a novel multi-granularity memory regulation and alignment module (MG-MRA) to solve this issue. By explicitly incorporating a latent variable attribute, from fine-grained to coarse semantic granularity, into intermediate features, our method could alleviate the over-confidence of the model about discriminative features of seen classes. Moreover, instead of matching discriminative features by traversing nearest neighbor, sparse attributes, \textit{i.e.}, global structural pattern, are recollected with respect to features and assigned to measure pair-wise image similarity in hashing. Extensive experiments on RegDB \cite{RegDB} and SYSU-MM01 \cite{SYSU} show the superiority of the proposed method that outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available in https://github.com/Chenfeng1271/MGMRA."
2109.09299,Semi-supervised Dense Keypoints Using Unlabeled Multiview Images,"This paper presents a new end-to-end semi-supervised framework to learn a dense keypoint detector using unlabeled multiview images. A key challenge lies in finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multiple views since the inverse of the keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derived nor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervision approaches used to learn sparse keypoints that rely on the exact correspondences. To address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraint that encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define a matchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other image's corresponding point, thus relaxing the requirement of the exact correspondences. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuous correspondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. We formulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of epipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the point-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. This generalization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint detection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images. Additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based regularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neural network architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the probabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view images by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performance compared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in terms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstruction accuracy."
2109.09484,On Circuit-based Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Remote Sensing   Imagery Classification,"This article aims to investigate how circuit-based hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) can be successfully employed as image classifiers in the context of remote sensing. The hybrid QCNNs enrich the classical architecture of CNNs by introducing a quantum layer within a standard neural network. The novel QCNN proposed in this work is applied to the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, chosen as an Earth Observation (EO) use case, and tested on the EuroSAT dataset used as reference benchmark. The results of the multiclass classification prove the effectiveness of the presented approach, by demonstrating that the QCNN performances are higher than the classical counterparts. Moreover, investigation of various quantum circuits shows that the ones exploiting quantum entanglement achieve the best classification scores. This study underlines the potentialities of applying quantum computing to an EO case study and provides the theoretical and experimental background for futures investigations."
2109.09658,FUTURE-AI: Guiding Principles and Consensus Recommendations for   Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging,"The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation, image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust in critical clinical applications. Addressing these concerns and risks, the FUTURE-AI framework has been proposed, which, sourced from a global multi-domain expert consensus, comprises guiding principles for increased trust, safety, and adoption for AI in healthcare. In this paper, we transform the general FUTURE-AI healthcare principles to a concise and specific AI implementation guide tailored to the needs of the medical imaging community. To this end, we carefully assess each building block of the FUTURE-AI framework consisting of (i) Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness and (vi) Explainability, and respectively define concrete best practices based on accumulated AI implementation experiences from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. We accompany our concrete step-by-step medical imaging development guide with a practical AI solution maturity checklist, thus enabling AI development teams to design, evaluate, maintain, and deploy technically, clinically and ethically trustworthy imaging AI solutions into clinical practice."
2109.09824,Well Googled is Half Done: Multimodal Forecasting of New Fashion Product   Sales with Image-based Google Trends,"New fashion product sales forecasting is a challenging problem that involves many business dynamics and cannot be solved by classical forecasting approaches. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of systematically probing exogenous knowledge in the form of Google Trends time series and combining it with multi-modal information related to a brand-new fashion item, in order to effectively forecast its sales despite the lack of past data. In particular, we propose a neural network-based approach, where an encoder learns a representation of the exogenous time series, while the decoder forecasts the sales based on the Google Trends encoding and the available visual and metadata information. Our model works in a non-autoregressive manner, avoiding the compounding effect of large first-step errors. As a second contribution, we present VISUELLE, a publicly available dataset for the task of new fashion product sales forecasting, containing multimodal information for 5577 real, new products sold between 2016-2019 from Nunalie, an Italian fast-fashion company. The dataset is equipped with images of products, metadata, related sales, and associated Google Trends. We use VISUELLE to compare our approach against state-of-the-art alternatives and several baselines, showing that our neural network-based approach is the most accurate in terms of both percentage and absolute error. It is worth noting that the addition of exogenous knowledge boosts the forecasting accuracy by 1.5% in terms of Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE), revealing the importance of exploiting informative external information. The code and dataset are both available at https://github.com/HumaticsLAB/GTM-Transformer."
2109.10795,Neural network relief: a pruning algorithm based on neural activity,"Current deep neural networks (DNNs) are overparameterized and use most of their neuronal connections during inference for each task. The human brain, however, developed specialized regions for different tasks and performs inference with a small fraction of its neuronal connections. We propose an iterative pruning strategy introducing a simple importance-score metric that deactivates unimportant connections, tackling overparameterization in DNNs and modulating the firing patterns. The aim is to find the smallest number of connections that is still capable of solving a given task with comparable accuracy, i.e. a simpler subnetwork. We achieve comparable performance for LeNet architectures on MNIST, and significantly higher parameter compression than state-of-the-art algorithms for VGG and ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet. Our approach also performs well for the two different optimizers considered -- Adam and SGD. The algorithm is not designed to minimize FLOPs when considering current hardware and software implementations, although it performs reasonably when compared to the state of the art."
2109.11172,Clustering performance analysis using a new correlation-based cluster   validity index,"There are various cluster validity indices used for evaluating clustering results. One of the main objectives of using these indices is to seek the optimal unknown number of clusters. Some indices work well for clusters with different densities, sizes, and shapes. Yet, one shared weakness of those validity indices is that they often provide only one optimal number of clusters. That number is unknown in real-world problems, and there might be more than one possible option. We develop a new cluster validity index based on a correlation between an actual distance between a pair of data points and a centroid distance of clusters that the two points occupy. Our proposed index constantly yields several local peaks and overcomes the previously stated weakness. Several experiments in different scenarios, including UCI real-world data sets, have been conducted to compare the proposed validity index with several well-known ones. An R package related to this new index called NCvalid is available at https://github.com/nwiroonsri/NCvalid."
2109.11265,End-to-End Dense Video Grounding via Parallel Regression,"Video grounding aims to localize the corresponding video moment in an untrimmed video given a language query. Existing methods often address this task in an indirect way, by casting it as a proposal-and-match or fusion-and-detection problem. Solving these surrogate problems often requires sophisticated label assignment during training and hand-crafted removal of near-duplicate results. Meanwhile, existing works typically focus on sparse video grounding with a single sentence as input, which could result in ambiguous localization due to its unclear description. In this paper, we tackle a new problem of dense video grounding, by simultaneously localizing multiple moments with a paragraph as input. From a perspective on video grounding as language conditioned regression, we present an end-to-end parallel decoding paradigm by re-purposing a Transformer-alike architecture (PRVG). The key design in our PRVG is to use languages as queries, and directly regress the moment boundaries based on language-modulated visual representations. Thanks to its simplicity in design, our PRVG framework can be applied in different testing schemes (sparse or dense grounding) and allows for efficient inference without any post-processing technique. In addition, we devise a robust proposal-level attention loss to guide the training of PRVG, which is invariant to moment duration and contributes to model convergence. We perform experiments on two video grounding benchmarks of ActivityNet Captions and TACoS, demonstrating that our PRVG can significantly outperform previous methods. We also perform in-depth studies to investigate the effectiveness of parallel regression paradigm on video grounding."
2109.11369,Recent Advances of Continual Learning in Computer Vision: An Overview,"In contrast to batch learning where all training data is available at once, continual learning represents a family of methods that accumulate knowledge and learn continuously with data available in sequential order. Similar to the human learning process with the ability of learning, fusing, and accumulating new knowledge coming at different time steps, continual learning is considered to have high practical significance. Hence, continual learning has been studied in various artificial intelligence tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress of continual learning in computer vision. In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularization, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation, and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented. At the end of this overview, several subareas, where continuous knowledge accumulation is potentially helpful while continual learning has not been well studied, are discussed."
2109.12252,Long-Range Feature Propagating for Natural Image Matting,"Natural image matting estimates the alpha values of unknown regions in the trimap. Recently, deep learning based methods propagate the alpha values from the known regions to unknown regions according to the similarity between them. However, we find that more than 50\% pixels in the unknown regions cannot be correlated to pixels in known regions due to the limitation of small effective reception fields of common convolutional neural networks, which leads to inaccurate estimation when the pixels in the unknown regions cannot be inferred only with pixels in the reception fields. To solve this problem, we propose Long-Range Feature Propagating Network (LFPNet), which learns the long-range context features outside the reception fields for alpha matte estimation. Specifically, we first design the propagating module which extracts the context features from the downsampled image. Then, we present Center-Surround Pyramid Pooling (CSPP) that explicitly propagates the context features from the surrounding context image patch to the inner center image patch. Finally, we use the matting module which takes the image, trimap and context features to estimate the alpha matte. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on the AlphaMatting and Adobe Image Matting datasets."
2109.12965,Text-based Person Search in Full Images via Semantic-Driven Proposal   Generation,"Finding target persons in full scene images with a query of text description has important practical applications in intelligent video surveillance.However, different from the real-world scenarios where the bounding boxes are not available, existing text-based person retrieval methods mainly focus on the cross modal matching between the query text descriptions and the gallery of cropped pedestrian images. To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."
2109.13004,Optimising for Interpretability: Convolutional Dynamic Alignment   Networks,"We introduce a new family of neural network models called Convolutional Dynamic Alignment Networks (CoDA Nets), which are performant classifiers with a high degree of inherent interpretability. Their core building blocks are Dynamic Alignment Units (DAUs), which are optimised to transform their inputs with dynamically computed weight vectors that align with task-relevant patterns. As a result, CoDA Nets model the classification prediction through a series of input-dependent linear transformations, allowing for linear decomposition of the output into individual input contributions. Given the alignment of the DAUs, the resulting contribution maps align with discriminative input patterns. These model-inherent decompositions are of high visual quality and outperform existing attribution methods under quantitative metrics. Further, CoDA Nets constitute performant classifiers, achieving on par results to ResNet and VGG models on e.g. CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. Lastly, CoDA Nets can be combined with conventional neural network models to yield powerful classifiers that more easily scale to complex datasets such as Imagenet whilst exhibiting an increased interpretable depth, i.e., the output can be explained well in terms of contributions from intermediate layers within the network."
2109.13360,IGAN: Inferent and Generative Adversarial Networks,"I present IGAN (Inferent Generative Adversarial Networks), a neural architecture that learns both a generative and an inference model on a complex high dimensional data distribution, i.e. a bidirectional mapping between data samples and a simpler low-dimensional latent space. It extends the traditional GAN framework with inference by rewriting the adversarial strategy in both the image and the latent space with an entangled game between data-latent encoded posteriors and priors. It brings a measurable stability and convergence to the classical GAN scheme, while keeping its generative quality and remaining simple and frugal in order to run on a lab PC. IGAN fosters the encoded latents to span the full prior space: this enables the exploitation of an enlarged and self-organised latent space in an unsupervised manner. An analysis of previously published articles sets the theoretical ground for the proposed algorithm. A qualitative demonstration of potential applications like self-supervision or multi-modal data translation is given on common image datasets including SAR and optical imagery."
2109.13572,Information Elevation Network for Fast Online Action Detection,"Online action detection (OAD) is a task that receives video segments within a streaming video as inputs and identifies ongoing actions within them. It is important to retain past information associated with a current action. However, long short-term memory (LSTM), a popular recurrent unit for modeling temporal information from videos, accumulates past information from the previous hidden and cell states and the extracted visual features at each timestep without considering the relationships between the past and current information. Consequently, the forget gate of the original LSTM can lose the accumulated information relevant to the current action because it determines which information to forget without considering the current action. We introduce a novel information elevation unit (IEU) that lifts up and accumulate the past information relevant to the current action in order to model the past information that is especially relevant to the current action. To the best of our knowledge, our IEN is the first attempt that considers the computational overhead for the practical use of OAD. Through ablation studies, we design an efficient and effective OAD network using IEUs, called an information elevation network (IEN). Our IEN uses visual features extracted by a fast action recognition network taking only RGB frames because extracting optical flows requires heavy computation overhead. On two OAD benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14 and TVSeries, our IEN outperforms state-of-the-art OAD methods using only RGB frames. Furthermore, on the THUMOS-14 dataset, our IEN outperforms the state-of-the-art OAD methods using two-stream features based on RGB frames and optical flows."
2109.13789,The VVAD-LRS3 Dataset for Visual Voice Activity Detection,"Robots are becoming everyday devices, increasing their interaction with humans. To make human-machine interaction more natural, cognitive features like Visual Voice Activity Detection (VVAD), which can detect whether a person is speaking or not, given visual input of a camera, need to be implemented. Neural networks are state of the art for tasks in Image Processing, Time Series Prediction, Natural Language Processing and other domains. Those Networks require large quantities of labeled data. Currently there are not many datasets for the task of VVAD. In this work we created a large scale dataset called the VVAD-LRS3 dataset, derived by automatic annotations from the LRS3 dataset. The VVAD-LRS3 dataset contains over 44K samples, over three times the next competitive dataset (WildVVAD). We evaluate different baselines on four kinds of features: facial and lip images, and facial and lip landmark features. With a Convolutional Neural Network Long Short Term Memory (CNN LSTM) on facial images an accuracy of 92% was reached on the test set. A study with humans showed that they reach an accuracy of 87.93% on the test set."
2109.14174,Cross-Camera Human Motion Transfer by Time Series Analysis,"With advances in optical sensor technology, heterogeneous camera systems are increasingly used for high-resolution (HR) video acquisition and analysis. However, motion transfer across multiple cameras poses challenges. To address this, we propose an algorithm based on time series analysis that identifies motion seasonality and constructs an additive model to extract transferable patterns. Validated on real-world data, our algorithm demonstrates effectiveness and interpretability. Notably, it improves pose estimation in low-resolution videos by leveraging patterns derived from HR counterparts, enhancing practical utility.

2109.14200,"Can phones, syllables, and words emerge as side-products of   cross-situational audiovisual learning? -- A computational investigation","Decades of research has studied how language learning infants learn to discriminate speech sounds, segment words, and associate words with their meanings. While gradual development of such capabilities is unquestionable, the exact nature of these skills and the underlying mental representations yet remains unclear. In parallel, computational studies have shown that basic comprehension of speech can be achieved by statistical learning between speech and concurrent referentially ambiguous visual input. These models can operate without prior linguistic knowledge such as representations of linguistic units, and without learning mechanisms specifically targeted at such units. This has raised the question of to what extent knowledge of linguistic units, such as phone(me)s, syllables, and words, could actually emerge as latent representations supporting the translation between speech and representations in other modalities, and without the units being proximal learning targets for the learner. In this study, we formulate this idea as the so-called latent language hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to general predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review the extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing computational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning simulations with different neural network models for audiovisual cross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real speech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the networks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by utilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic selectivity and temporal characteristics of the representations. As a result, we find that representations associated..."
2109.14335,A Systematic Survey of Deep Learning-based Single-Image Super-Resolution,"Single-image super-resolution (SISR) is an important task in image processing, which aims to enhance the resolution of imaging systems. Recently, SISR has made a huge leap and has achieved promising results with the help of deep learning (DL). In this survey, we give an overview of DL-based SISR methods and group them according to their design targets. Specifically, we first introduce the problem definition, research background, and the significance of SISR. Secondly, we introduce some related works, including benchmark datasets, upsampling methods, optimization objectives, and image quality assessment methods. Thirdly, we provide a detailed investigation of SISR and give some domain-specific applications of it. Fourthly, we present the reconstruction results of some classic SISR methods to intuitively know their performance. Finally, we discuss some issues that still exist in SISR and summarize some new trends and future directions. This is an exhaustive survey of SISR, which can help researchers better understand SISR and inspire more exciting research in this field. An investigation project for SISR is provided at https://github.com/CV-JunchengLi/SISR-Survey."
2109.14406,Neural Knitworks: Patched Neural Implicit Representation Networks,"Coordinate-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, despite being capable of learning neural implicit representations, are not performant for internal image synthesis applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used instead for a variety of internal generative tasks, at the cost of a larger model. We propose Neural Knitwork, an architecture for neural implicit representation learning of natural images that achieves image synthesis by optimizing the distribution of image patches in an adversarial manner and by enforcing consistency between the patch predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a coordinate-based MLP tailored for synthesis tasks such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and denoising. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique by training on these three tasks. The results show that modeling natural images using patches, rather than pixels, produces results of higher fidelity. The resulting model requires 80% fewer parameters than alternative CNN-based solutions while achieving comparable performance and training time."
2109.14760,Chest X-Rays Image Classification from beta-Variational Autoencoders   Latent Features,"Chest X-Ray (CXR) is one of the most common diagnostic techniques used in everyday clinical practice all around the world. We hereby present a work which intends to investigate and analyse the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to extract information from such images and allow to classify them, trying to keep our methodology as general as possible and possibly also usable in a real world scenario without much effort, in the future. To move in this direction, we trained several beta-Variational Autoencoder (beta-VAE) models on the CheXpert dataset, one of the largest publicly available collection of labeled CXR images; from these models, latent features have been extracted and used to train other Machine Learning models, able to classify the original images from the features extracted by the beta-VAE. Lastly, tree-based models have been combined together in ensemblings to improve the results without the necessity of further training or models engineering. Expecting some drop in pure performance with the respect to state of the art classification specific models, we obtained encouraging results, which show the viability of our approach and the usability of the high level features extracted by the autoencoders for classification tasks."
2109.14879,Robust Segmentation Models using an Uncertainty Slice Sampling Based   Annotation Workflow,"Semantic segmentation neural networks require pixel-level annotations in large quantities to achieve a good performance. In the medical domain, such annotations are expensive, because they are time-consuming and require expert knowledge. Active learning optimizes the annotation effort by devising strategies to select cases for labeling that are most informative to the model. In this work, we propose an uncertainty slice sampling (USS) strategy for semantic segmentation of 3D medical volumes that selects 2D image slices for annotation and compare it with various other strategies. We demonstrate the efficiency of USS on a CT liver segmentation task using multi-site data. After five iterations, the training data resulting from USS consisted of 2410 slices (4% of all slices in the data pool) compared to 8121 (13%), 8641 (14%), and 3730 (6%) for uncertainty volume (UVS), random volume (RVS), and random slice (RSS) sampling, respectively. Despite being trained on the smallest amount of data, the model based on the USS strategy evaluated on 234 test volumes significantly outperformed models trained according to other strategies and achieved a mean Dice index of 0.964, a relative volume error of 4.2%, a mean surface distance of 1.35 mm, and a Hausdorff distance of 23.4 mm. This was only slightly inferior to 0.967, 3.8%, 1.18 mm, and 22.9 mm achieved by a model trained on all available data, but the robustness analysis using the 5th percentile of Dice and the 95th percentile of the remaining metrics demonstrated that USS resulted not only in the most robust model compared to other sampling schemes, but also outperformed the model trained on all data according to Dice (0.946 vs. 0.945) and mean surface distance (1.92 mm vs. 2.03 mm)."
2109.15242,Transferability Estimation for Semantic Segmentation Task,"Transferability estimation is a fundamental problem in transfer learning to predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source task) to a target task. With the guidance of transferability score, we can efficiently select the highly transferable source models without performing the real transfer in practice. Recent analytical transferability metrics are mainly designed for image classification problem, and currently there is no specific investigation for the transferability estimation of semantic segmentation task, which is an essential problem in autonomous driving, medical image analysis, etc. Consequently, we further extend the recent analytical transferability metric OTCE (Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy) score to the semantic segmentation task. The challenge in applying the OTCE score is the high dimensional segmentation output, which is difficult to find the optimal coupling between so many pixels under an acceptable computation cost. Thus we propose to randomly sample N pixels for computing OTCE score and take the expectation over K repetitions as the final transferability score. Experimental evaluation on Cityscapes, BDD100K and GTA5 datasets demonstrates that the OTCE score highly correlates with the transfer performance."
2110.00317,Visual Cluster Separation Using High-Dimensional Sharpened   Dimensionality Reduction,"Applying dimensionality reduction (DR) to large, high-dimensional data sets can be challenging when distinguishing the underlying high-dimensional data clusters in a 2D projection for exploratory analysis. We address this problem by first sharpening the clusters in the original high-dimensional data prior to the DR step using Local Gradient Clustering (LGC). We then project the sharpened data from the high-dimensional space to 2D by a user-selected DR method. The sharpening step aids this method to preserve cluster separation in the resulting 2D projection. With our method, end-users can label each distinct cluster to further analyze an otherwise unlabeled data set. Our `High-Dimensional Sharpened DR' (HD-SDR) method, tested on both synthetic and real-world data sets, is favorable to DR methods with poor cluster separation and yields a better visual cluster separation than these DR methods with no sharpening. Our method achieves good quality (measured by quality metrics) and scales computationally well with large high-dimensional data. To illustrate its concrete applications, we further apply HD-SDR on a recent astronomical catalog."
2110.00472,Survey and synthesis of state of the art in driver monitoring,"Road-vehicle accidents are mostly due to human errors, and many such accidents could be avoided by continuously monitoring the driver. Driver monitoring (DM) is a topic of growing interest in the automotive industry, and it will remain relevant for all vehicles that are not fully autonomous, and thus for decades for the average vehicle owner. The present paper focuses on the first step of DM, which consists in characterizing the state of the driver. Since DM will be increasingly linked to driving automation (DA), this paper presents a clear view of the role of DM at each of the six SAE levels of DA. This paper surveys the state of the art of DM, and then synthesizes it, providing a unique, structured, polychotomous view of the many characterization techniques of DM. Informed by the survey, the paper characterizes the driver state along the five main dimensions--called here ""(sub)states""--of drowsiness, mental workload, distraction, emotions, and under the influence. The polychotomous view of DM is presented through a pair of interlocked tables that relate these states to their indicators (e.g., the eye-blink rate) and the sensors that can access each of these indicators (e.g., a camera). The tables factor in not only the effects linked directly to the driver, but also those linked to the (driven) vehicle and the (driving) environment. They show, at a glance, to concerned researchers, equipment providers, and vehicle manufacturers (1) most of the options they have to implement various forms of advanced DM systems, and (2) fruitful areas for further research and innovation."
2110.01774,HighlightMe: Detecting Highlights from Human-Centric Videos,"We present a domain- and user-preference-agnostic approach to detect highlightable excerpts from human-centric videos. Our method works on the graph-based representation of multiple observable human-centric modalities in the videos, such as poses and faces. We use an autoencoder network equipped with spatial-temporal graph convolutions to detect human activities and interactions based on these modalities. We train our network to map the activity- and interaction-based latent structural representations of the different modalities to per-frame highlight scores based on the representativeness of the frames. We use these scores to compute which frames to highlight and stitch contiguous frames to produce the excerpts. We train our network on the large-scale AVA-Kinetics action dataset and evaluate it on four benchmark video highlight datasets: DSH, TVSum, PHD2, and SumMe. We observe a 4-12% improvement in the mean average precision of matching the human-annotated highlights over state-of-the-art methods in these datasets, without requiring any user-provided preferences or dataset-specific fine-tuning."
2110.02657,Towards Robotic Knee Arthroscopy: Multi-Scale Network for Tissue-Tool   Segmentation,"Tissue awareness has a great demand to improve surgical accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. In arthroscopy, it is one of the challenging tasks due to surgical sites exhibit limited features and textures. Moreover, arthroscopic surgical video shows high intra-class variations. Arthroscopic videos are recorded with endoscope known as arthroscope which records tissue structures at proximity, therefore, frames contain minimal joint structure. As consequences, fully conventional network-based segmentation model suffers from long- and short- term dependency problems. In this study, we present a densely connected shape aware multi-scale segmentation model which captures multi-scale features and integrates shape features to achieve tissue-tool segmentations. The model has been evaluated with three distinct datasets. Moreover, with the publicly available polyp dataset our proposed model achieved 5.09 % accuracy improvement."
2110.02911,Shifting Capsule Networks from the Cloud to the Deep Edge,"Capsule networks (CapsNets) are an emerging trend in image processing. In contrast to a convolutional neural network, CapsNets are not vulnerable to object deformation, as the relative spatial information of the objects is preserved across the network. However, their complexity is mainly related to the capsule structure and the dynamic routing mechanism, which makes it almost unreasonable to deploy a CapsNet, in its original form, in a resource-constrained device powered by a small microcontroller (MCU). In an era where intelligence is rapidly shifting from the cloud to the edge, this high complexity imposes serious challenges to the adoption of CapsNets at the very edge. To tackle this issue, we present an API for the execution of quantized CapsNets in Arm Cortex-M and RISC-V MCUs. Our software kernels extend the Arm CMSIS-NN and RISC-V PULP-NN to support capsule operations with 8-bit integers as operands. Along with it, we propose a framework to perform post-training quantization of a CapsNet. Results show a reduction in memory footprint of almost 75%, with accuracy loss ranging from 0.07% to 0.18%. In terms of throughput, our Arm Cortex-M API enables the execution of primary capsule and capsule layers with medium-sized kernels in just 119.94 and 90.60 milliseconds (ms), respectively (STM32H755ZIT6U, Cortex-M7 @ 480 MHz). For the GAP-8 SoC (RISC-V RV32IMCXpulp @ 170 MHz), the latency drops to 7.02 and 38.03 ms, respectively."
2110.03105,MetaCOG: A Hierarchical Probabilistic Model for Learning Meta-Cognitive   Visual Representations,"Humans have the capacity to question what we see and to recognize when our vision is unreliable (e.g., when we realize that we are experiencing a visual illusion). Inspired by this capacity, we present MetaCOG: a hierarchical probabilistic model that can be attached to a neural object detector to monitor its outputs and determine their reliability. MetaCOG achieves this by learning a probabilistic model of the object detector's performance via Bayesian inference -- i.e., a meta-cognitive representation of the network's propensity to hallucinate or miss different object categories. Given a set of video frames processed by an object detector, MetaCOG performs joint inference over the underlying 3D scene and the detector's performance, grounding inference on a basic assumption of object permanence. Paired with three neural object detectors, we show that MetaCOG accurately recovers each detector's performance parameters and improves the overall system's accuracy. We additionally show that MetaCOG is robust to varying levels of error in object detector outputs, showing proof-of-concept for a novel approach to the problem of detecting and correcting errors in vision systems when ground-truth is not available."
2110.03464,Differential Anomaly Detection for Facial Images,"Due to their convenience and high accuracy, face recognition systems are widely employed in governmental and personal security applications to automatically recognise individuals. Despite recent advances, face recognition systems have shown to be particularly vulnerable to identity attacks (i.e., digital manipulations and attack presentations). Identity attacks pose a big security threat as they can be used to gain unauthorised access and spread misinformation. In this context, most algorithms for detecting identity attacks generalise poorly to attack types that are unknown at training time. To tackle this problem, we introduce a differential anomaly detection framework in which deep face embeddings are first extracted from pairs of images (i.e., reference and probe) and then combined for identity attack detection. The experimental evaluation conducted over several databases shows a high generalisation capability of the proposed method for detecting unknown attacks in both the digital and physical domains."
2110.03544,3D Unsupervised Region-Aware Registration Transformer,"This paper concerns the research problem of point cloud registration to find the rigid transformation to optimally align the source point set with the target one. Learning robust point cloud registration models with deep neural networks has emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering promising performance in predicting the global geometric transformation for a pair of point sets. Existing methods first leverage an encoder to regress the global shape descriptor, which is then decoded into a shape-conditioned transformation via concatenation-based conditioning. However, different regions of a 3D shape vary in their geometric structures which makes it more sense that we have a region-conditioned transformation instead of the shape-conditioned one. In this paper, we define our 3D registration function through the introduction of a new design of 3D region partition module that is able to divide the input shape to different regions with a self-supervised 3D shape reconstruction loss without the need for ground truth labels. We further propose the 3D shape transformer module to efficiently and effectively capture short- and long-range geometric dependencies for regions on the 3D shape Consequently, the region-aware decoder module is proposed to predict the transformations for different regions respectively. The global geometric transformation from the source point set to the target one is then formed by the weighted fusion of region-aware transformation. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our experiments show that our 3D-URRT achieves superior registration performance over various benchmark datasets (e.g. ModelNet40)."
2110.03574,A New Simple Vision Algorithm for Detecting the Enzymic Browning Defects   in Golden Delicious Apples,"In this work, a simple vision algorithm is designed and implemented to extract and identify the surface defects on the Golden Delicious apples caused by the enzymic browning process. 34 Golden Delicious apples were selected for the experiments, of which 17 had enzymic browning defects and the other 17 were sound. The image processing part of the proposed vision algorithm extracted the defective surface area of the apples with high accuracy of 97.15%. The area and mean of the segmented images were selected as the 2x1 feature vectors to feed into a designed artificial neural network. The analysis based on the above features indicated that the images with a mean less than 0.0065 did not belong to the defective apples; rather, they were extracted as part of the calyx and stem of the healthy apples. The classification accuracy of the neural network applied in this study was 99.19%"
2110.03854,Meta-Learning 3D Shape Segmentation Functions,"Learning robust 3D shape segmentation functions with deep neural networks has emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering promising performance in producing a consistent part segmentation of each 3D shape. Generalizing across 3D shape segmentation functions requires robust learning of priors over the respective function space and enables consistent part segmentation of shapes in presence of significant 3D structure variations. Existing generalization methods rely on extensive training of 3D shape segmentation functions on large-scale labeled datasets. In this paper, we proposed to formalize the learning of a 3D shape segmentation function space as a meta-learning problem, aiming to predict a 3D segmentation model that can be quickly adapted to new shapes with no or limited training data. More specifically, we define each task as unsupervised learning of shape-conditioned 3D segmentation function which takes as input points in 3D space and predicts the part-segment labels. The 3D segmentation function is trained by a self-supervised 3D shape reconstruction loss without the need for part labels. Also, we introduce an auxiliary deep neural network as a meta-learner which takes as input a 3D shape and predicts the prior over the respective 3D segmentation function space. We show in experiments that our meta-learning approach, denoted as Meta-3DSeg, leads to improvements on unsupervised 3D shape segmentation over the conventional designs of deep neural networks for 3D shape segmentation functions."
2110.04080,Landslide Detection in Real-Time Social Media Image Streams,"Lack of global data inventories obstructs scientific modeling of and response to landslide hazards which are oftentimes deadly and costly. To remedy this limitation, new approaches suggest solutions based on citizen science that requires active participation. However, as a non-traditional data source, social media has been increasingly used in many disaster response and management studies in recent years. Inspired by this trend, we propose to capitalize on social media data to mine landslide-related information automatically with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Specifically, we develop a state-of-the-art computer vision model to detect landslides in social media image streams in real time. To that end, we create a large landslide image dataset labeled by experts and conduct extensive model training experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can be deployed in an online fashion to support global landslide susceptibility maps and emergency response."
2110.04544,CLIP-Adapter: Better Vision-Language Models with Feature Adapters,"Large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-training has shown significant progress in visual representation learning. Unlike traditional visual systems trained by a fixed set of discrete labels, a new paradigm was introduced in \cite{radford2021learning} to directly learn to align images with raw texts in an open-vocabulary setting. On downstream tasks, a carefully chosen text prompt is employed to make zero-shot predictions.~To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, context optimization \cite{zhou2021coop} has been proposed to learn continuous vectors as task-specific prompts with few-shot training examples.~In this paper, we show that there is an alternative path to achieve better vision-language models other than prompt tuning.~While prompt tuning is for the textual inputs, we propose CLIP-Adapter to conduct fine-tuning with feature adapters on either visual or language branch. Specifically, CLIP-Adapter adopts an additional bottleneck layer to learn new features and performs residual-style feature blending with the original pre-trained features.~As a consequence, CLIP-Adapter is able to outperform context optimization while maintains a simple design. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on various visual classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is released at t https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/CLIP-Adapter."
2110.04563,Automatic Recognition of Abdominal Organs in Ultrasound Images based on   Deep Neural Networks and K-Nearest-Neighbor Classification,"Abdominal ultrasound imaging has been widely used to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of various abdominal organs. In order to shorten the examination time and reduce the cognitive burden on the sonographers, we present a classification method that combines the deep learning techniques and k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) classification to automatically recognize various abdominal organs in the ultrasound images in real time. Fine-tuned deep neural networks are used in combination with PCA dimension reduction to extract high-level features from raw ultrasound images, and a k-NN classifier is employed to predict the abdominal organ in the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the task of ultrasound image classification to automatically recognize six abdominal organs. A comprehensive comparison of different configurations is conducted to study the influence of different feature extractors and classifiers on the classification accuracy. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that with minimal training effort, our method can ""lazily"" recognize the abdominal organs in the ultrasound images in real time with an accuracy of 96.67%. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/LeeKeyu/abdominal_ultrasound_classification."
2110.05098,SurroundNet: Towards Effective Low-Light Image Enhancement,"Although Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) has made substantial progress in the low-light image enhancement task, one critical problem of CNNs is the paradox of model complexity and performance. This paper presents a novel SurroundNet which only involves less than 150$K$ parameters (about 80-98 percent size reduction compared to SOTAs) and achieves very competitive performance. The proposed network comprises several Adaptive Retinex Blocks (ARBlock), which can be viewed as a novel extension of Single Scale Retinex in feature space. The core of our ARBlock is an efficient illumination estimation function called Adaptive Surround Function (ASF). It can be regarded as a general form of surround functions and be implemented by convolution layers. In addition, we also introduce a Low-Exposure Denoiser (LED) to smooth the low-light image before the enhancement. We evaluate the proposed method on the real-world low-light dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the superiority of our submitted SurroundNet in both performance and network parameters against State-of-the-Art low-light image enhancement methods. Code is available at https: github.com/ouc-ocean-group/SurroundNet."
2110.05319,MD Loss: Efficient Training of 3D Seismic Fault Segmentation Network   under Sparse Labels by Weakening Anomaly Annotation,"Data-driven fault detection has been regarded as a 3D image segmentation task. The models trained from synthetic data are difficult to generalize in some surveys. Recently, training 3D fault segmentation using sparse manual 2D slices is thought to yield promising results, but manual labeling has many false negative labels (abnormal annotations), which is detrimental to training and consequently to detection performance. Motivated to train 3D fault segmentation networks under sparse 2D labels while suppressing false negative labels, we analyze the training process gradient and propose the Mask Dice (MD) loss. Moreover, the fault is an edge feature, and current encoder-decoder architectures widely used for fault detection (e.g., U-shape network) are not conducive to edge representation. Consequently, Fault-Net is proposed, which is designed for the characteristics of faults, employs high-resolution propagation features, and embeds MultiScale Compression Fusion block to fuse multi-scale information, which allows the edge information to be fully preserved during propagation and fusion, thus enabling advanced performance via few computational resources. Experimental demonstrates that MD loss supports the inclusion of human experience in training and suppresses false negative labels therein, enabling baseline models to improve performance and generalize to more surveys. Fault-Net is capable to provide a more stable and reliable interpretation of faults, it uses extremely low computational resources and inference is significantly faster than other models. Our method indicates optimal performance in comparison with several mainstream methods."
2110.06382,A Survey of Open Source User Activity Traces with Applications to User   Mobility Characterization and Modeling,"The current state-of-the-art in user mobility research has extensively relied on open-source mobility traces captured from pedestrian and vehicular activity through a variety of communication technologies as users engage in a wide-range of applications, including connected healthcare, localization, social media, e-commerce, etc. Most of these traces are feature-rich and diverse, not only in the information they provide, but also in how they can be used and leveraged. This diversity poses two main challenges for researchers and practitioners who wish to make use of available mobility datasets. First, it is quite difficult to get a bird's eye view of the available traces without spending considerable time looking them up. Second, once they have found the traces, they still need to figure out whether the traces are adequate to their needs.   The purpose of this survey is three-fold. It proposes a taxonomy to classify open-source mobility traces including their mobility mode, data source and collection technology. It then uses the proposed taxonomy to classify existing open-source mobility traces and finally, highlights three case studies using popular publicly available datasets to showcase how our taxonomy can tease out feature sets in traces to help determine their applicability to specific use-cases."
2110.07588,Playing for 3D Human Recovery,"Image- and video-based 3D human recovery (i.e., pose and shape estimation) have achieved substantial progress. However, due to the prohibitive cost of motion capture, existing datasets are often limited in scale and diversity. In this work, we obtain massive human sequences by playing the video game with automatically annotated 3D ground truths. Specifically, we contribute GTA-Human, a large-scale 3D human dataset generated with the GTA-V game engine, featuring a highly diverse set of subjects, actions, and scenarios. More importantly, we study the use of game-playing data and obtain five major insights. First, game-playing data is surprisingly effective. A simple frame-based baseline trained on GTA-Human outperforms more sophisticated methods by a large margin. For video-based methods, GTA-Human is even on par with the in-domain training set. Second, we discover that synthetic data provides critical complements to the real data that is typically collected indoor. Our investigation into domain gap provides explanations for our data mixture strategies that are simple yet useful. Third, the scale of the dataset matters. The performance boost is closely related to the additional data available. A systematic study reveals the model sensitivity to data density from multiple key aspects. Fourth, the effectiveness of GTA-Human is also attributed to the rich collection of strong supervision labels (SMPL parameters), which are otherwise expensive to acquire in real datasets. Fifth, the benefits of synthetic data extend to larger models such as deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, for which a significant impact is also observed. We hope our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D human recovery to the real world. Homepage: https://caizhongang.github.io/projects/GTA-Human/"
2110.08164,Accurate Fine-grained Layout Analysis for the Historical Tibetan   Document Based on the Instance Segmentation,"Accurate layout analysis without subsequent text-line segmentation remains an ongoing challenge, especially when facing the Kangyur, a kind of historical Tibetan document featuring considerable touching components and mottled background. Aiming at identifying different regions in document images, layout analysis is indispensable for subsequent procedures such as character recognition. However, there was only a little research being carried out to perform line-level layout analysis which failed to deal with the Kangyur. To obtain the optimal results, a fine-grained sub-line level layout analysis approach is presented. Firstly, we introduced an accelerated method to build the dataset which is dynamic and reliable. Secondly, enhancement had been made to the SOLOv2 according to the characteristics of the Kangyur. Then, we fed the enhanced SOLOv2 with the prepared annotation file during the training phase. Once the network is trained, instances of the text line, sentence, and titles can be segmented and identified during the inference stage. The experimental results show that the proposed method delivers a decent 72.7% average precision on our dataset. In general, this preliminary research provides insights into the fine-grained sub-line level layout analysis and testifies the SOLOv2-based approaches. We also believe that the proposed methods can be adopted on other language documents with various layouts."
2110.08486,Understanding Multimodal Procedural Knowledge by Sequencing Multimodal   Instructional Manuals,"The ability to sequence unordered events is an essential skill to comprehend and reason about real world task procedures, which often requires thorough understanding of temporal common sense and multimodal information, as these procedures are often communicated through a combination of texts and images. Such capability is essential for applications such as sequential task planning and multi-source instruction summarization. While humans are capable of reasoning about and sequencing unordered multimodal procedural instructions, whether current machine learning models have such essential capability is still an open question. In this work, we benchmark models' capability of reasoning over and sequencing unordered multimodal instructions by curating datasets from popular online instructional manuals and collecting comprehensive human annotations. We find models not only perform significantly worse than humans but also seem incapable of efficiently utilizing the multimodal information. To improve machines' performance on multimodal event sequencing, we propose sequentiality-aware pretraining techniques that exploit the sequential alignment properties of both texts and images, resulting in > 5% significant improvements."
2110.08589,Pseudo-label refinement using superpixels for semi-supervised brain   tumour segmentation,"Training neural networks using limited annotations is an important problem in the medical domain. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically require large, annotated datasets to achieve acceptable performance which, in the medical domain, are especially difficult to obtain as they require significant time from expert radiologists. Semi-supervised learning aims to overcome this problem by learning segmentations with very little annotated data, whilst exploiting large amounts of unlabelled data. However, the best-known technique, which utilises inferred pseudo-labels, is vulnerable to inaccurate pseudo-labels degrading the performance. We propose a framework based on superpixels - meaningful clusters of adjacent pixels - to improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels and address this issue. Our framework combines superpixels with semi-supervised learning, refining the pseudo-labels during training using the features and edges of the superpixel maps. This method is evaluated on a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for the task of brain tumour region segmentation. Our method demonstrates improved performance over the standard semi-supervised pseudo-labelling baseline when there is a reduced annotator burden and only 5 annotated patients are available. We report DSC=0.824 and DSC=0.707 for the test set whole tumour and tumour core regions respectively."
2110.09772,Synergy between 3DMM and 3D Landmarks for Accurate 3D Facial Geometry,"This work studies learning from a synergy process of 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) and 3D facial landmarks to predict complete 3D facial geometry, including 3D alignment, face orientation, and 3D face modeling. Our synergy process leverages a representation cycle for 3DMM parameters and 3D landmarks. 3D landmarks can be extracted and refined from face meshes built by 3DMM parameters. We next reverse the representation direction and show that predicting 3DMM parameters from sparse 3D landmarks improves the information flow. Together we create a synergy process that utilizes the relation between 3D landmarks and 3DMM parameters, and they collaboratively contribute to better performance. We extensively validate our contribution on full tasks of facial geometry prediction and show our superior and robust performance on these tasks for various scenarios. Particularly, we adopt only simple and widely-used network operations to attain fast and accurate facial geometry prediction. Codes and data: https://choyingw.github.io/works/SynergyNet/"
2110.09841,Cutting Voxel Projector a New Approach to Construct 3D Cone Beam CT   Operator,"We introduce a novel class of projectors for 3D cone beam tomographic reconstruction. Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon's algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon's algorithm, tuned to achieve the same accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in a GPU optimized open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction. GitHub repository of the project https://github.com/kulvait/KCT_cbct."
2110.10156,Cross-Sim-NGF: FFT-Based Global Rigid Multimodal Alignment of Image   Volumes using Normalized Gradient Fields,"Multimodal image alignment involves finding spatial correspondences between volumes varying in appearance and structure. Automated alignment methods are often based on local optimization that can be highly sensitive to their initialization. We propose a global optimization method for rigid multimodal 3D image alignment, based on a novel efficient algorithm for computing similarity of normalized gradient fields (NGF) in the frequency domain. We validate the method experimentally on a dataset comprised of 20 brain volumes acquired in four modalities (T1w, Flair, CT, [18F] FDG PET), synthetically displaced with known transformations. The proposed method exhibits excellent performance on all six possible modality combinations, and outperforms all four reference methods by a large margin. The method is fast; a 3.4Mvoxel global rigid alignment requires approximately 40 seconds of computation, and the proposed algorithm outperforms a direct algorithm for the same task by more than three orders of magnitude. Open-source implementation is provided."
2110.10194,CoFi: Coarse-to-Fine ICP for LiDAR Localization in an Efficient   Long-lasting Point Cloud Map,"LiDAR odometry and localization has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. In the existing works, iterative closest point (ICP) is widely used since it is precise and efficient. Due to its non-convexity and its local iterative strategy, however, ICP-based method easily falls into local optima, which in turn calls for a precise initialization. In this paper, we propose CoFi, a Coarse-to-Fine ICP algorithm for LiDAR localization. Specifically, the proposed algorithm down-samples the input point sets under multiple voxel resolution, and gradually refines the transformation from the coarse point sets to the fine-grained point sets. In addition, we propose a map based LiDAR localization algorithm that extracts semantic feature points from the LiDAR frames and apply CoFi to estimate the pose on an efficient point cloud map. With the help of the Cylinder3D algorithm for LiDAR scan semantic segmentation, the proposed CoFi localization algorithm demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI odometry benchmark, with significant improvement over the literature."
2110.10494,Deep Point Cloud Normal Estimation via Triplet Learning,"Normal estimation on 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D vision and graphics. Current methods often show limited accuracy in predicting normals at sharp features (e.g., edges and corners) and less robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel normal estimation method for point clouds. It consists of two phases: (a) feature encoding which learns representations of local patches, and (b) normal estimation that takes the learned representation as input and regresses the normal vector. We are motivated that local patches on isotropic and anisotropic surfaces have similar or distinct normals, and that separable features or representations can be learned to facilitate normal estimation. To realise this, we first construct triplets of local patches on 3D point cloud data, and design a triplet network with a triplet loss for feature encoding. We then design a simple network with several MLPs and a loss function to regress the normal vector. Despite having a smaller network size compared to most other methods, experimental results show that our method preserves sharp features and achieves better normal estimation results on CAD-like shapes."
2110.11128,A Strong Baseline for Semi-Supervised Incremental Few-Shot Learning,"Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn models that generalize to novel classes with limited training samples. Recent works advance FSL towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also available and propose semi-supervised FSL methods. Another line of methods also cares about the performance of base classes in addition to the novel ones and thus establishes the incremental FSL scenario. In this paper, we generalize the above two under a more realistic yet complex setting, named by Semi-Supervised Incremental Few-Shot Learning (S2 I-FSL). To tackle the task, we propose a novel paradigm containing two parts: (1) a well-designed meta-training algorithm for mitigating ambiguity between base and novel classes caused by unreliable pseudo labels and (2) a model adaptation mechanism to learn discriminative features for novel classes while preserving base knowledge using few labeled and all the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on standard FSL, semi-supervised FSL, incremental FSL, and the firstly built S2 I-FSL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
2110.11281,Fusion of complementary 2D and 3D mesostructural datasets using   generative adversarial networks,"Modelling the impact of a material's mesostructure on device level performance typically requires access to 3D image data containing all the relevant information to define the geometry of the simulation domain. This image data must include sufficient contrast between phases to distinguish each material, be of high enough resolution to capture the key details, but also have a large enough field-of-view to be representative of the material in general. It is rarely possible to obtain data with all of these properties from a single imaging technique. In this paper, we present a method for combining information from pairs of distinct but complementary imaging techniques in order to accurately reconstruct the desired multi-phase, high resolution, representative, 3D images. Specifically, we use deep convolutional generative adversarial networks to implement super-resolution, style transfer and dimensionality expansion. To demonstrate the widespread applicability of this tool, two pairs of datasets are used to validate the quality of the volumes generated by fusing the information from paired imaging techniques. Three key mesostructural metrics are calculated in each case to show the accuracy of this method. Having confidence in the accuracy of our method, we then demonstrate its power by applying to a real data pair from a lithium ion battery electrode, where the required 3D high resolution image data is not available anywhere in the literature. We believe this approach is superior to previously reported statistical material reconstruction methods both in terms of its fidelity and ease of use. Furthermore, much of the data required to train this algorithm already exists in the literature, waiting to be combined. As such, our open-access code could precipitate a step change by generating the hard to obtain high quality image volumes necessary to simulate behaviour at the mesoscale."
2110.11334,Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Survey,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning systems. For instance, in autonomous driving, we would like the driving system to issue an alert and hand over the control to humans when it detects unusual scenes or objects that it has never seen during training time and cannot make a safe decision. The term, OOD detection, first emerged in 2017 and since then has received increasing attention from the research community, leading to a plethora of methods developed, ranging from classification-based to density-based to distance-based ones. Meanwhile, several other problems, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD), are closely related to OOD detection in terms of motivation and methodology. Despite common goals, these topics develop in isolation, and their subtle differences in definition and problem setting often confuse readers and practitioners. In this survey, we first present a unified framework called generalized OOD detection, which encompasses the five aforementioned problems, i.e., AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection, and OD. Under our framework, these five problems can be seen as special cases or sub-tasks, and are easier to distinguish. We then review each of these five areas by summarizing their recent technical developments, with a special focus on OOD detection methodologies. We conclude this survey with open challenges and potential research directions."
2110.12261,espiownage: Tracking Transients in Steelpan Drum Strikes Using   Surveillance Technology,"We present an improvement in the ability to meaningfully track features in high speed videos of Caribbean steelpan drums illuminated by Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI). This is achieved through the use of up-to-date computer vision libraries for object detection and image segmentation as well as a significant effort toward cleaning the dataset previously used to train systems for this application. Besides improvements on previous metric scores by 10% or more, noteworthy in this project are the introduction of a segmentation-regression map for the entire drum surface yielding interference fringe counts comparable to those obtained via object detection, as well as the accelerated workflow for coordinating the data-cleaning-and-model-training feedback loop for rapid iteration allowing this project to be conducted on a timescale of only 18 days."
2110.12509,Estimating Total Lung Volume from Pixel-level Thickness Maps of Chest Radiographs Using Deep Learning,"Purpose: To estimate the total lung volume (TLV) from real and synthetic frontal chest radiographs (CXR) on a pixel level using lung thickness maps generated by a U-Net deep learning model. Methods: This retrospective study included 5,959 chest CT scans from two public datasets: the lung nodule analysis 2016 (n=656) and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) pulmonary embolism detection challenge 2020 (n=5,303). Additionally, 72 participants were selected from the Klinikum Rechts der Isar dataset (October 2018 to December 2019), each with a corresponding chest radiograph taken within seven days. Synthetic radiographs and lung thickness maps were generated using forward projection of CT scans and their lung segmentations. A U-Net model was trained on synthetic radiographs to predict lung thickness maps and estimate TLV. Model performance was assessed using mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), and two-sided Student's t-distribution. Results: The study included 72 participants (45 male, 27 female, 33 healthy: mean age 62 years [range 34-80]; 39 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: mean age 69 years [range 47-91]). TLV predictions showed low error rates ($MSE_{Public-Synthetic}$=0.16 $L^2$, $MSE_{KRI-Synthetic}$=0.20 $L^2$, $MSE_{KRI-Real}$=0.35 $L^2$) and strong correlations with CT-derived reference standard TLV ($n_{Public-Synthetic}$=1,191, r=0.99, P<0.001; $n_{KRI-Synthetic}$=72, r=0.97, P<0.001; $n_{KRI-Real}$=72, r=0.91, P<0.001). The Luna16 test data demonstrated the highest performance, with the lowest mean squared error (MSE = 0.09 $L^2$) and strongest correlation (r = 0.99, P <0.001) for TLV estimation. Conclusion: The U-Net-generated pixel-level lung thickness maps successfully estimated TLV for both synthetic and real radiographs."
2110.12915,Revealing unforeseen diagnostic image features with deep learning by   detecting cardiovascular diseases from apical four-chamber ultrasounds,"Background. With the rise of highly portable, wireless, and low-cost ultrasound devices and automatic ultrasound acquisition techniques, an automated interpretation method requiring only a limited set of views as input could make preliminary cardiovascular disease diagnoses more accessible. In this study, we developed a deep learning (DL) method for automated detection of impaired left ventricular (LV) function and aortic valve (AV) regurgitation from apical four-chamber (A4C) ultrasound cineloops and investigated which anatomical structures or temporal frames provided the most relevant information for the DL model to enable disease classification.   Methods and Results. A4C ultrasounds were extracted from 3,554 echocardiograms of patients with either impaired LV function (n=928), AV regurgitation (n=738), or no significant abnormalities (n=1,888). Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained separately to classify the respective disease cases against normal cases. The overall classification accuracy of the impaired LV function detection model was 86%, and that of the AV regurgitation detection model was 83%. Feature importance analyses demonstrated that the LV myocardium and mitral valve were important for detecting impaired LV function, while the tip of the mitral valve anterior leaflet, during opening, was considered important for detecting AV regurgitation.   Conclusion. The proposed method demonstrated the feasibility of a 3D CNN approach in detection of impaired LV function and AV regurgitation using A4C ultrasound cineloops. The current research shows that DL methods can exploit large training data to detect diseases in a different way than conventionally agreed upon methods, and potentially reveal unforeseen diagnostic image features."
2110.12962,Event Data Association via Robust Model Fitting for Event-based Object   Tracking,"Event-based approaches, which are based on bio-inspired asynchronous event cameras, have achieved promising performance on various computer vision tasks. However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association (called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusion problem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event data, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. In EDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its information entropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generation strategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events, to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present a two-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true models from the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric model fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy to automatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use the selected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without being affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions."
2110.13385,IIP-Transformer: Intra-Inter-Part Transformer for Skeleton-Based Action   Recognition,"Recently, Transformer-based networks have shown great promise on skeleton-based action recognition tasks. The ability to capture global and local dependencies is the key to success while it also brings quadratic computation and memory cost. Another problem is that previous studies mainly focus on the relationships among individual joints, which often suffers from the noisy skeleton joints introduced by the noisy inputs of sensors or inaccurate estimations. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based network (IIP-Transformer). Instead of exploiting interactions among individual joints, our IIP-Transformer incorporates body joints and parts interactions simultaneously and thus can capture both joint-level (intra-part) and part-level (inter-part) dependencies efficiently and effectively. From the data aspect, we introduce a part-level skeleton data encoding that significantly reduces the computational complexity and is more robust to joint-level skeleton noise. Besides, a new part-level data augmentation is proposed to improve the performance of the model. On two large-scale datasets, NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120, the proposed IIP-Transformer achieves the-state-of-art performance with more than 8x less computational complexity than DSTA-Net, which is the SOTA Transformer-based method."
2110.13571,Emotion recognition in talking-face videos using persistent entropy and   neural networks,"The automatic recognition of a person's emotional state has become a very active research field that involves scientists specialized in different areas such as artificial intelligence, computer vision or psychology, among others. Our main objective in this work is to develop a novel approach, using persistent entropy and neural networks as main tools, to recognise and classify emotions from talking-face videos. Specifically, we combine audio-signal and image-sequence information to compute a topology signature(a 9-dimensional vector) for each video. We prove that small changes in the video produce small changes in the signature. These topological signatures are used to feed a neural network to distinguish between the following emotions: neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, and surprised. The results reached are promising and competitive, beating the performance reached in other state-of-the-art works found in the literature."
2110.13694,A Fast Horizon Detector and a New Annotated Dataset for Maritime Video   Processing,"Accurate and fast sea horizon detection is vital for tasks in autonomous navigation and maritime security, such as video stabilization, target region reduction, precise tracking, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a novel sea horizon detector from RGB videos, focusing on rapid and effective sea noise suppression while preserving weak horizon edges. Line fitting methods are subsequently employed on filtered edges for horizon detection. We address the filtering problem by extracting line segments with a very low edge threshold, ensuring the detection of line segments even in low-contrast horizon conditions. We show that horizon line segments have simple and relevant properties in RGB images, which we exploit to suppress noisy segments. Then we use the surviving segments to construct a filtered edge map and infer the horizon from the filtered edges. We propose a careful incorporation of temporal information for horizon inference and experimentally show its effectiveness. We address the computational constraint by providing a vectorized implementation for efficient CPU execution, and leveraging image downsizing with minimal loss of accuracy on the original size. Moreover, we contribute a public horizon line dataset to enrich existing data resources. Our algorithm's performance is rigorously evaluated against state-of-the-art methods, and its components are validated through ablation experiments.

2110.13819,CloudFindr: A Deep Learning Cloud Artifact Masker for Satellite DEM Data,"Artifact removal is an integral component of cinematic scientific visualization, and is especially challenging with big datasets in which artifacts are difficult to define. In this paper, we describe a method for creating cloud artifact masks which can be used to remove artifacts from satellite imagery using a combination of traditional image processing together with deep learning based on U-Net. Compared to previous methods, our approach does not require multi-channel spectral imagery but performs successfully on single-channel Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). DEMs are a representation of the topography of the Earth and have a variety applications including planetary science, geology, flood modeling, and city planning."
2110.14240,3rd Place Solution for VisDA 2021 Challenge -- Universally Domain   Adaptive Image Recognition,"The Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) 2021 Challenge calls for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods that can deal with both input distribution shift and label set variance between the source and target domains. In this report, we introduce a universal domain adaptation (UniDA) method by aggregating several popular feature extraction and domain adaptation schemes. First, we utilize VOLO, a Transformer-based architecture with state-of-the-art performance in several visual tasks, as the backbone to extract effective feature representations. Second, we modify the open-set classifier of OVANet to recognize the unknown class with competitive accuracy and robustness. As shown in the leaderboard, our proposed UniDA method ranks the 3rd place with 48.49% ACC and 70.8% AUROC in the VisDA 2021 Challenge."
2110.14553,GenURL: A General Framework for Unsupervised Representation Learning,"Unsupervised representation learning (URL), which learns compact embeddings of high-dimensional data without supervision, has made remarkable progress recently. However, the development of URLs for different requirements is independent, which limits the generalization of the algorithms, especially prohibitive as the number of tasks grows. For example, dimension reduction methods, t-SNE, and UMAP optimize pair-wise data relationships by preserving the global geometric structure, while self-supervised learning, SimCLR, and BYOL focus on mining the local statistics of instances under specific augmentations. To address this dilemma, we summarize and propose a unified similarity-based URL framework, GenURL, which can smoothly adapt to various URL tasks. In this paper, we regard URL tasks as different implicit constraints on the data geometric structure that help to seek optimal low-dimensional representations that boil down to data structural modeling (DSM) and low-dimensional transformation (LDT). Specifically, DMS provides a structure-based submodule to describe the global structures, and LDT learns compact low-dimensional embeddings with given pretext tasks. Moreover, an objective function, General Kullback-Leibler divergence (GKL), is proposed to connect DMS and LDT naturally. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GenURL achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised visual learning, unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD), graph embeddings (GE), and dimension reduction."
2110.14731,Vision Transformer for Classification of Breast Ultrasound Images,"Medical ultrasound (US) imaging has become a prominent modality for breast cancer imaging due to its ease-of-use, low-cost and safety. In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the method of choice in vision applications and have shown excellent potential in automatic classification of US images. Despite their success, their restricted local receptive field limits their ability to learn global context information. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) designs that are based on self-attention between image patches have shown great potential to be an alternative to CNNs. In this study, for the first time, we utilize ViT to classify breast US images using different augmentation strategies. The results are provided as classification accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, and the performance is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs. The results indicate that the ViT models have comparable efficiency with or even better than the CNNs in classification of US breast images."
2110.15188,The magnitude vector of images,"The magnitude of a finite metric space has recently emerged as a novel invariant quantity, allowing to measure the effective size of a metric space. Despite encouraging first results demonstrating the descriptive abilities of the magnitude, such as being able to detect the boundary of a metric space, the potential use cases of magnitude remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the properties of the magnitude on images, an important data modality in many machine learning applications. By endowing each individual images with its own metric space, we are able to define the concept of magnitude on images and analyse the individual contribution of each pixel with the magnitude vector. In particular, we theoretically show that the previously known properties of boundary detection translate to edge detection abilities in images. Furthermore, we demonstrate practical use cases of magnitude for machine learning applications and propose a novel magnitude model that consists of a computationally efficient magnitude computation and a learnable metric. By doing so, we address the computational hurdle that used to make magnitude impractical for many applications and open the way for the adoption of magnitude in machine learning research."
2110.15268,Learning Continuous Face Representation with Explicit Functions,"How to represent a face pattern? While it is presented in a continuous way in our visual system, computers often store and process the face image in a discrete manner with 2D arrays of pixels. In this study, we attempt to learn a continuous representation for face images with explicit functions. First, we propose an explicit model (EmFace) for human face representation in the form of a finite sum of mathematical terms, where each term is an analytic function element. Further, to estimate the unknown parameters of EmFace, a novel neural network, EmNet, is designed with an encoder-decoder structure and trained using the backpropagation algorithm, where the encoder is defined by a deep convolutional neural network and the decoder is an explicit mathematical expression of EmFace. Experimental results show that EmFace has a higher representation performance on faces with various expressions, postures, and other factors, compared to that of other methods. Furthermore, EmFace achieves reasonable performance on several face image processing tasks, including face image restoration, denoising, and transformation."
2110.15352,MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning,"Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves >90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result. Our study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification."
2110.15558,AI-Powered Semantic Segmentation and Fluid Volume Calculation of Lung CT   images in Covid-19 Patients,"COVID-19 pandemic is a deadly disease spreading very fast. People with the confronted immune system are susceptible to many health conditions. A highly significant condition is pneumonia, which is found to be the cause of death in the majority of patients. The main purpose of this study is to find the volume of GGO and consolidation of a covid-19 patient so that the physicians can prioritize the patients. Here we used transfer learning techniques for segmentation of lung CTs with the latest libraries and techniques which reduces training time and increases the accuracy of the AI Model. This system is trained with DeepLabV3+ network architecture and model Resnet50 with Imagenet weights. We used different augmentation techniques like Gaussian Noise, Horizontal shift, color variation, etc to get to the result. Intersection over Union(IoU) is used as the performance metrics. The IoU of lung masks is predicted as 99.78% and that of infected masks is as 89.01%. Our work effectively measures the volume of infected region by calculating the volume of infected and lung mask region of the patients."
2111.00231,Two Heads are Better than One: Geometric-Latent Attention for Point   Cloud Classification and Segmentation,"We present an innovative two-headed attention layer that combines geometric and latent features to segment a 3D scene into semantically meaningful subsets. Each head combines local and global information, using either the geometric or latent features, of a neighborhood of points and uses this information to learn better local relationships. This Geometric-Latent attention layer (Ge-Latto) is combined with a sub-sampling strategy to capture global features. Our method is invariant to permutation thanks to the use of shared-MLP layers, and it can also be used with point clouds with varying densities because the local attention layer does not depend on the neighbor order. Our proposal is simple yet robust, which allows it to achieve competitive results in the ShapeNetPart and ModelNet40 datasets, and the state-of-the-art when segmenting the complex dataset S3DIS, with 69.2% IoU on Area 5, and 89.7% overall accuracy using K-fold cross-validation on the 6 areas."
2111.01584,Fitness Landscape Footprint: A Framework to Compare Neural Architecture   Search Problems,"Neural architecture search is a promising area of research dedicated to automating the design of neural network models. This field is rapidly growing, with a surge of methodologies ranging from Bayesian optimization,neuroevoltion, to differentiable search, and applications in various contexts. However, despite all great advances, few studies have presented insights on the difficulty of the problem itself, thus the success (or fail) of these methodologies remains unexplained. In this sense, the field of optimization has developed methods that highlight key aspects to describe optimization problems. The fitness landscape analysis stands out when it comes to characterize reliably and quantitatively search algorithms. In this paper, we propose to use fitness landscape analysis to study a neural architecture search problem. Particularly, we introduce the fitness landscape footprint, an aggregation of eight (8)general-purpose metrics to synthesize the landscape of an architecture search problem. We studied two problems, the classical image classification benchmark CIFAR-10, and the Remote-Sensing problem So2Sat LCZ42. The results present a quantitative appraisal of the problems, allowing to characterize the relative difficulty and other characteristics, such as the ruggedness or the persistence, that helps to tailor a search strategy to the problem. Also, the footprint is a tool that enables the comparison of multiple problems."
2111.02168,The Klarna Product Page Dataset: Web Element Nomination with Graph   Neural Networks and Large Language Models,"Web automation holds the potential to revolutionize how users interact with the digital world, offering unparalleled assistance and simplifying tasks via sophisticated computational methods. Central to this evolution is the web element nomination task, which entails identifying unique elements on webpages. Unfortunately, the development of algorithmic designs for web automation is hampered by the scarcity of comprehensive and realistic datasets that reflect the complexity faced by real-world applications on the Web. To address this, we introduce the Klarna Product Page Dataset, a comprehensive and diverse collection of webpages that surpasses existing datasets in richness and variety. The dataset features 51,701 manually labeled product pages from 8,175 e-commerce websites across eight geographic regions, accompanied by a dataset of rendered page screenshots. To initiate research on the Klarna Product Page Dataset, we empirically benchmark a range of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the web element nomination task. We make three important contributions. First, we found that a simple Convolutional GNN (GCN) outperforms complex state-of-the-art nomination methods. Second, we introduce a training refinement procedure that involves identifying a small number of relevant elements from each page using the aforementioned GCN. These elements are then passed to a large language model for the final nomination. This procedure significantly improves the nomination accuracy by 16.8 percentage points on our challenging dataset, without any need for fine-tuning. Finally, in response to another prevalent challenge in this field - the abundance of training methodologies suitable for element nomination - we introduce the Challenge Nomination Training Procedure, a novel training approach that further boosts nomination accuracy."
2111.03216,Fast Camouflaged Object Detection via Edge-based Reversible   Re-calibration Network,"Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to detect objects with similar patterns (e.g., texture, intensity, colour, etc) to their surroundings, and recently has attracted growing research interest. As camouflaged objects often present very ambiguous boundaries, how to determine object locations as well as their weak boundaries is challenging and also the key to this task. Inspired by the biological visual perception process when a human observer discovers camouflaged objects, this paper proposes a novel edge-based reversible re-calibration network called ERRNet. Our model is characterized by two innovative designs, namely Selective Edge Aggregation (SEA) and Reversible Re-calibration Unit (RRU), which aim to model the visual perception behaviour and achieve effective edge prior and cross-comparison between potential camouflaged regions and background. More importantly, RRU incorporates diverse priors with more comprehensive information comparing to existing COD models. Experimental results show that ERRNet outperforms existing cutting-edge baselines on three COD datasets and five medical image segmentation datasets. Especially, compared with the existing top-1 model SINet, ERRNet significantly improves the performance by $\sim$6% (mean E-measure) with notably high speed (79.3 FPS), showing that ERRNet could be a general and robust solution for the COD task."
2111.03861,What augmentations are sensitive to hyper-parameters and why?,"We apply augmentations to our dataset to enhance the quality of our predictions and make our final models more resilient to noisy data and domain drifts. Yet the question remains, how are these augmentations going to perform with different hyper-parameters? In this study we evaluate the sensitivity of augmentations with regards to the model's hyper parameters along with their consistency and influence by performing a Local Surrogate (LIME) interpretation on the impact of hyper-parameters when different augmentations are applied to a machine learning model. We have utilized Linear regression coefficients for weighing each augmentation. Our research has proved that there are some augmentations which are highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and others which are more resilient and reliable."
2111.04019,Multi-Fake Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks for Imbalance   Hyperspectral Image Classification,"This paper presents a novel multi-fake evolutionary generative adversarial network(MFEGAN) for handling imbalance hyperspectral image classification. It is an end-to-end approach in which different generative objective losses are considered in the generator network to improve the classification performance of the discriminator network. Thus, the same discriminator network has been used as a standard classifier by embedding the classifier network on top of the discriminating function. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated through two hyperspectral spatial-spectral data sets. The same generative and discriminator architectures have been utilized with two different GAN objectives for a fair performance comparison with the proposed method. It is observed from the experimental validations that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with better classification performance."
2111.04737,Synthetic magnetic resonance images for domain adaptation: Application   to fetal brain tissue segmentation,"The quantitative assessment of the developing human brain in utero is crucial to fully understand neurodevelopment. Thus, automated multi-tissue fetal brain segmentation algorithms are being developed, which in turn require annotated data to be trained. However, the available annotated fetal brain datasets are limited in number and heterogeneity, hampering domain adaptation strategies for robust segmentation. In this context, we use FaBiAN, a Fetal Brain magnetic resonance Acquisition Numerical phantom, to simulate various realistic magnetic resonance images of the fetal brain along with its class labels. We demonstrate that these multiple synthetic annotated data, generated at no cost and further reconstructed using the target super-resolution technique, can be successfully used for domain adaptation of a deep learning method that segments seven brain tissues. Overall, the accuracy of the segmentation is significantly enhanced, especially in the cortical gray matter, the white matter, the cerebellum, the deep gray matter and the brain stem."
2111.05222,Cross Attentional Audio-Visual Fusion for Dimensional Emotion   Recognition,"Multimodal analysis has recently drawn much interest in affective computing, since it can improve the overall accuracy of emotion recognition over isolated uni-modal approaches. The most effective techniques for multimodal emotion recognition efficiently leverage diverse and complimentary sources of information, such as facial, vocal, and physiological modalities, to provide comprehensive feature representations. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted from videos, where complex spatiotemporal relationships may be captured. Most of the existing fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complimentary nature of audio-visual (A-V) modalities. We introduce a cross-attentional fusion approach to extract the salient features across A-V modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of continuous values of valence and arousal. Our new cross-attentional A-V fusion model efficiently leverages the inter-modal relationships. In particular, it computes cross-attention weights to focus on the more contributive features across individual modalities, and thereby combine contributive feature representations, which are then fed to fully connected layers for the prediction of valence and arousal. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated experimentally on videos from the RECOLA and Fatigue (private) data-sets. Results indicate that our cross-attentional A-V fusion model is a cost-effective approach that outperforms state-of-the-art fusion approaches. Code is available: \url{https://github.com/praveena2j/Cross-Attentional-AV-Fusion}"
2111.05663,The Impact of Changes in Resolution on the Persistent Homology of Images,"Digital images enable quantitative analysis of material properties at micro and macro length scales, but choosing an appropriate resolution when acquiring the image is challenging. A high resolution means longer image acquisition and larger data requirements for a given sample, but if the resolution is too low, significant information may be lost. This paper studies the impact of changes in resolution on persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis that provides a signature of structure in an image across all length scales. Given prior information about a function, the geometry of an object, or its density distribution at a given resolution, we provide methods to select the coarsest resolution yielding results within an acceptable tolerance. We present numerical case studies for an illustrative synthetic example and samples from porous materials where the theoretical bounds are unknown."
2111.05778,Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of a Fast Algorithm for Extracting   Polygons from Signed Distance Bounds,"Recently there has been renewed interest in signed distance bound representations due to their unique properties for 3D shape modelling. This is especially the case for deep learning-based bounds. However, it is beneficial to work with polygons in most computer-graphics applications. Thus, in this paper we introduce and investigate an asymptotically fast method for transforming signed distance bounds into polygon meshes. This is achieved by combining the principles of sphere tracing (or ray marching) with traditional polygonization techniques, such as Marching Cubes. We provide theoretical and experimental evidence that this approach is of the $O(N^2\log N)$ computational complexity for a polygonization grid with $N^3$ cells. The algorithm is tested on both a set of primitive shapes as well as signed distance bounds generated from point clouds by machine learning (and represented as neural networks). Given its speed, implementation simplicity and portability, we argue that it could prove useful during the modelling stage as well as in shape compression for storage.   The code is available here: https://github.com/nenadmarkus/gridhopping"
2111.05790,Early Myocardial Infarction Detection over Multi-view Echocardiography,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of mortality in the world that occurs due to a blockage of the coronary arteries feeding the myocardium. An early diagnosis of MI and its localization can mitigate the extent of myocardial damage by facilitating early therapeutic interventions. Following the blockage of a coronary artery, the regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) of the ischemic myocardial segments is the earliest change to set in. Echocardiography is the fundamental tool to assess any RWMA. Assessing the motion of the left ventricle (LV) wall only from a single echocardiography view may lead to missing the diagnosis of MI as the RWMA may not be visible on that specific view. Therefore, in this study, we propose to fuse apical 4-chamber (A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in which a total of 12 myocardial segments can be analyzed for MI detection. The proposed method first estimates the motion of the LV wall by Active Polynomials (APs), which extract and track the endocardial boundary to compute myocardial segment displacements. The features are extracted from the A4C and A2C view displacements, which are concatenated and fed into the classifiers to detect MI. The main contributions of this study are 1) creation of a new benchmark dataset by including both A4C and A2C views in a total of 260 echocardiography recordings, which is publicly shared with the research community, 2) improving the performance of the prior work of threshold-based APs by a Machine Learning based approach, and 3) a pioneer MI detection approach via multi-view echocardiography by fusing the information of A4C and A2C views. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 90.91% sensitivity and 86.36% precision for MI detection over multi-view echocardiography. The software implementation is shared at https://github.com/degerliaysen/MultiEchoAI."
2111.06021,Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptation,"Contrastive learning has shown impressive success in enhancing feature discriminability for various visual tasks in a self-supervised manner, but the standard contrastive paradigm (features+$\ell_{2}$ normalization) has limited benefits when applied in domain adaptation. We find that this is mainly because the class weights (weights of the final fully connected layer) are ignored in the domain adaptation optimization process, which makes it difficult for features to cluster around the corresponding class weights. To solve this problem, we propose the \emph{simple but powerful} Probabilistic Contrastive Learning (PCL), which moves beyond the standard paradigm by removing $\ell_{2}$ normalization and replacing the features with probabilities. PCL can guide the probability distribution towards a one-hot configuration, thus minimizing the discrepancy between features and class weights. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PCL and observe consistent performance gains on five tasks, i.e., Unsupervised/Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (UDA/SSDA), Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), UDA Detection and Semantic Segmentation. Notably, for UDA Semantic Segmentation on SYNTHIA, PCL surpasses the sophisticated CPSL-D by $>\!2\%$ in terms of mean IoU with a much lower training cost (PCL: 1*3090, 5 days v.s. CPSL-D: 4*V100, 11 days). Code is available at https://github.com/ljjcoder/Probabilistic-Contrastive-Learning."
2111.06628,Learning to Break Deep Perceptual Hashing: The Use Case NeuralHash,"Apple recently revealed its deep perceptual hashing system NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices before files are uploaded to its iCloud service. Public criticism quickly arose regarding the protection of user privacy and the system's reliability. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations, forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users, everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view, based on our results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective."
2111.08256,Online Meta Adaptation for Variable-Rate Learned Image Compression,"This work addresses two major issues of end-to-end learned image compression (LIC) based on deep neural networks: variable-rate learning where separate networks are required to generate compressed images with varying qualities, and the train-test mismatch between differentiable approximate quantization and true hard quantization. We introduce an online meta-learning (OML) setting for LIC, which combines ideas from meta learning and online learning in the conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) framework. By treating the conditional variables as meta parameters and treating the generated conditional features as meta priors, the desired reconstruction can be controlled by the meta parameters to accommodate compression with variable qualities. The online learning framework is used to update the meta parameters so that the conditional reconstruction is adaptively tuned for the current image. Through the OML mechanism, the meta parameters can be effectively updated through SGD. The conditional reconstruction is directly based on the quantized latent representation in the decoder network, and therefore helps to bridge the gap between the training estimation and true quantized latent distribution. Experiments demonstrate that our OML approach can be flexibly applied to different state-of-the-art LIC methods to achieve additional performance improvements with little computation and transmission overhead."
2111.08492,Real-time 3D human action recognition based on Hyperpoint sequence,"Real-time 3D human action recognition has broad industrial applications, such as surveillance, human-computer interaction, and healthcare monitoring. By relying on complex spatio-temporal local encoding, most existing point cloud sequence networks capture spatio-temporal local structures to recognize 3D human actions. To simplify the point cloud sequence modeling task, we propose a lightweight and effective point cloud sequence network referred to as SequentialPointNet for real-time 3D action recognition. Instead of capturing spatio-temporal local structures, SequentialPointNet encodes the temporal evolution of static appearances to recognize human actions. Firstly, we define a novel type of point data, Hyperpoint, to better describe the temporally changing human appearances. A theoretical foundation is provided to clarify the information equivalence property for converting point cloud sequences into Hyperpoint sequences. Secondly, the point cloud sequence modeling task is decomposed into a Hyperpoint embedding task and a Hyperpoint sequence modeling task. Specifically, for Hyperpoint embedding, the static point cloud technology is employed to convert point cloud sequences into Hyperpoint sequences, which introduces inherent frame-level parallelism; for Hyperpoint sequence modeling, a Hyperpoint-Mixer module is designed as the basic building block to learning the spatio-temporal features of human actions. Extensive experiments on three widely-used 3D action recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed SequentialPointNet achieves competitive classification performance with up to 10X faster than existing approaches."
2111.08774,Finding the Right Moment: Human-Assisted Trailer Creation via Task   Composition,"Movie trailers perform multiple functions: they introduce viewers to the story, convey the mood and artistic style of the film, and encourage audiences to see the movie. These diverse functions make trailer creation a challenging endeavor. In this work, we focus on finding trailer moments in a movie, i.e., shots that could be potentially included in a trailer. We decompose this task into two subtasks: narrative structure identification and sentiment prediction. We model movies as graphs, where nodes are shots and edges denote semantic relations between them. We learn these relations using joint contrastive training which distills rich textual information (e.g., characters, actions, situations) from screenplays. An unsupervised algorithm then traverses the graph and selects trailer moments from the movie that human judges prefer to ones selected by competitive supervised approaches. A main advantage of our algorithm is that it uses interpretable criteria, which allows us to deploy it in an interactive tool for trailer creation with a human in the loop. Our tool allows users to select trailer shots in under 30 minutes that are superior to fully automatic methods and comparable to (exclusive) manual selection by experts."
2111.08785,Detecting AutoAttack Perturbations in the Frequency Domain,"Recently, adversarial attacks on image classification networks by the AutoAttack (Croce and Hein, 2020b) framework have drawn a lot of attention. While AutoAttack has shown a very high attack success rate, most defense approaches are focusing on network hardening and robustness enhancements, like adversarial training. This way, the currently best-reported method can withstand about 66% of adversarial examples on CIFAR10. In this paper, we investigate the spatial and frequency domain properties of AutoAttack and propose an alternative defense. Instead of hardening a network, we detect adversarial attacks during inference, rejecting manipulated inputs. Based on a rather simple and fast analysis in the frequency domain, we introduce two different detection algorithms. First, a black box detector that only operates on the input images and achieves a detection accuracy of 100% on the AutoAttack CIFAR10 benchmark and 99.3% on ImageNet, for epsilon = 8/255 in both cases. Second, a whitebox detector using an analysis of CNN feature maps, leading to a detection rate of also 100% and 98.7% on the same benchmarks."
2111.09013,Image Super-Resolution Using T-Tetromino Pixels,"For modern high-resolution imaging sensors, pixel binning is performed in low-lighting conditions and in case high frame rates are required. To recover the original spatial resolution, single-image super-resolution techniques can be applied for upscaling. To achieve a higher image quality after upscaling, we propose a novel binning concept using tetromino-shaped pixels. It is embedded into the field of compressed sensing and the coherence is calculated to motivate the sensor layouts used. Next, we investigate the reconstruction quality using tetromino pixels for the first time in literature. Instead of using different types of tetrominoes as proposed elsewhere, we show that using a small repeating cell consisting of only four T-tetrominoes is sufficient. For reconstruction, we use a locally fully connected reconstruction (LFCR) network as well as two classical reconstruction methods from the field of compressed sensing. Using the LFCR network in combination with the proposed tetromino layout, we achieve superior image quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and visually compared to conventional single-image super-resolution using the very deep super-resolution (VDSR) network. For PSNR, a gain of up to \SI[retain-explicit-plus]{+1.92}{dB} is achieved."
2111.10007,FBNetV5: Neural Architecture Search for Multiple Tasks in One Run,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design accurate and efficient image classification models. However, applying NAS to a new computer vision task still requires a huge amount of effort. This is because 1) previous NAS research has been over-prioritized on image classification while largely ignoring other tasks; 2) many NAS works focus on optimizing task-specific components that cannot be favorably transferred to other tasks; and 3) existing NAS methods are typically designed to be ""proxyless"" and require significant effort to be integrated with each new task's training pipelines. To tackle these challenges, we propose FBNetV5, a NAS framework that can search for neural architectures for a variety of vision tasks with much reduced computational cost and human effort. Specifically, we design 1) a search space that is simple yet inclusive and transferable; 2) a multitask search process that is disentangled with target tasks' training pipeline; and 3) an algorithm to simultaneously search for architectures for multiple tasks with a computational cost agnostic to the number of tasks. We evaluate the proposed FBNetV5 targeting three fundamental vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Models searched by FBNetV5 in a single run of search have outperformed the previous stateof-the-art in all the three tasks: image classification (e.g., +1.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs as compared to FBNetV3), semantic segmentation (e.g., +1.8% higher ADE20K val. mIoU than SegFormer with 3.6x fewer FLOPs), and object detection (e.g., +1.1% COCO val. mAP with 1.2x fewer FLOPs as compared to YOLOX)."
2111.10602,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for RF-based Gesture Recognition,"Human gesture recognition with Radio Frequency (RF) signals has attained acclaim due to the omnipresence, privacy protection, and broad coverage nature of RF signals. These gesture recognition systems rely on neural networks trained with a large number of labeled data. However, the recognition model trained with data under certain conditions would suffer from significant performance degradation when applied in practical deployment, which limits the application of gesture recognition systems. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for RF-based gesture recognition aiming to enhance the performance of the recognition model in new conditions by making effective use of the unlabeled data from new conditions. We first propose pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization to utilize unlabeled data for model training and eliminate the feature discrepancies in different domains. Then we propose a confidence constraint loss to enhance the effectiveness of pseudo-labeling, and design two corresponding data augmentation methods based on the characteristic of the RF signals to strengthen the performance of the consistency regularization, which can make the framework more effective and robust. Furthermore, we propose a cross-match loss to integrate the pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, which makes the whole framework simple yet effective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework could achieve 4.35% and 2.25% accuracy improvement comparing with the state-of-the-art methods on public WiFi dataset and millimeter wave (mmWave) radar dataset, respectively."
2111.10755,Generalized Inversion of Nonlinear Operators,"Inversion of operators is a fundamental concept in data processing. Inversion of linear operators is well studied, supported by established theory. When an inverse either does not exist or is not unique, generalized inverses are used. Most notable is the Moore-Penrose inverse, widely used in physics, statistics, and various fields of engineering. This work investigates generalized inversion of nonlinear operators.   We first address broadly the desired properties of generalized inverses, guided by the Moore-Penrose axioms. We define the notion for general sets, and then a refinement, termed pseudo-inverse, for normed spaces. We present conditions for existence and uniqueness of a pseudo-inverse and establish theoretical results investigating its properties, such as continuity, its value for operator compositions and projection operators, and others. Analytic expressions are given for the pseudo-inverse of some well-known, non-invertible, nonlinear operators, such as hard- or soft-thresholding and ReLU. We analyze a neural layer and discuss relations to wavelet thresholding.   Next, the Drazin inverse, and a relaxation, are investigated for operators with equal domain and range. We present scenarios where inversion is expressible as a linear combination of forward applications of the operator. Such scenarios arise for classes of nonlinear operators with vanishing polynomials, similar to the minimal or characteristic polynomials for matrices. Inversion using forward applications may facilitate the development of new efficient algorithms for approximating generalized inversion of complex nonlinear operators."
2111.10854,XnODR and XnIDR: Two Accurate and Fast Fully Connected Layers For   Convolutional Neural Networks,"Capsule Network is powerful at defining the positional relationship between features in deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks, but it is computationally expensive and not suitable for running on mobile devices. The bottleneck is in the computational complexity of the Dynamic Routing mechanism used between the capsules. On the other hand, XNOR-Net is fast and computationally efficient, though it suffers from low accuracy due to information loss in the binarization process. To address the computational burdens of the Dynamic Routing mechanism, this paper proposes new Fully Connected (FC) layers by xnorizing the linear projection outside or inside the Dynamic Routing within the CapsFC layer. Specifically, our proposed FC layers have two versions, XnODR (Xnorize the Linear Projection Outside Dynamic Routing) and XnIDR (Xnorize the Linear Projection Inside Dynamic Routing). To test the generalization of both XnODR and XnIDR, we insert them into two different networks, MobileNetV2 and ResNet-50. Our experiments on three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MultiMNIST validate their effectiveness. The results demonstrate that both XnODR and XnIDR help networks to have high accuracy with lower FLOPs and fewer parameters (e.g., 96.14% correctness with 2.99M parameters and 311.74M FLOPs on CIFAR-10)."
2111.11057,Learning to Aggregate Multi-Scale Context for Instance Segmentation in   Remote Sensing Images,"The task of instance segmentation in remote sensing images, aiming at performing per-pixel labeling of objects at instance level, is of great importance for various civil applications. Despite previous successes, most existing instance segmentation methods designed for natural images encounter sharp performance degradations when they are directly applied to top-view remote sensing images. Through careful analysis, we observe that the challenges mainly come from the lack of discriminative object features due to severe scale variations, low contrasts, and clustered distributions. In order to address these problems, a novel context aggregation network (CATNet) is proposed to improve the feature extraction process. The proposed model exploits three lightweight plug-and-play modules, namely dense feature pyramid network (DenseFPN), spatial context pyramid (SCP), and hierarchical region of interest extractor (HRoIE), to aggregate global visual context at feature, spatial, and instance domains, respectively. DenseFPN is a multi-scale feature propagation module that establishes more flexible information flows by adopting inter-level residual connections, cross-level dense connections, and feature re-weighting strategy. Leveraging the attention mechanism, SCP further augments the features by aggregating global spatial context into local regions. For each instance, HRoIE adaptively generates RoI features for different downstream tasks. Extensive evaluations of the proposed scheme on iSAID, DIOR, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-arts under similar computational costs. Source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yeliudev/CATNet."
2111.11280,Point Cloud Color Constancy,"In this paper, we present Point Cloud Color Constancy, in short PCCC, an illumination chromaticity estimation algorithm exploiting a point cloud. We leverage the depth information captured by the time-of-flight (ToF) sensor mounted rigidly with the RGB sensor, and form a 6D cloud where each point contains the coordinates and RGB intensities, noted as (x,y,z,r,g,b). PCCC applies the PointNet architecture to the color constancy problem, deriving the illumination vector point-wise and then making a global decision about the global illumination chromaticity. On two popular RGB-D datasets, which we extend with illumination information, as well as on a novel benchmark, PCCC obtains lower error than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our method is simple and fast, requiring merely 16*16-size input and reaching speed over 500 fps, including the cost of building the point cloud and net inference."
2111.11288,SSR: An Efficient and Robust Framework for Learning with Unknown Label   Noise,"Despite the large progress in supervised learning with neural networks, there are significant challenges in obtaining high-quality, large-scale and accurately labelled datasets. In such a context, how to learn in the presence of noisy labels has received more and more attention. As a relatively complex problem, in order to achieve good results, current approaches often integrate components from several fields, such as supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning and resulting in complicated methods. Furthermore, they often make multiple assumptions about the type of noise of the data. This affects the model robustness and limits its performance under different noise conditions. In this paper, we consider a novel problem setting, Learning with Unknown Label Noise}(LULN), that is, learning when both the degree and the type of noise are unknown. Under this setting, unlike previous methods that often introduce multiple assumptions and lead to complex solutions, we propose a simple, efficient and robust framework named Sample Selection and Relabelling(SSR), that with a minimal number of hyperparameters achieves SOTA results in various conditions. At the heart of our method is a sample selection and relabelling mechanism based on a non-parametric KNN classifier~(NPK) $g_q$ and a parametric model classifier~(PMC) $g_p$, respectively, to select the clean samples and gradually relabel the noisy samples. Without bells and whistles, such as model co-training, self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised learning, and with robustness concerning the settings of its few hyper-parameters, our method significantly surpasses previous methods on both CIFAR10/CIFAR100 with synthetic noise and real-world noisy datasets such as WebVision, Clothing1M and ANIMAL-10N. Code is available at https://github.com/MrChenFeng/SSR_BMVC2022."
2111.11394,4D iterative reconstruction of brain fMRI in the moving fetus,"Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful imaging technique for studying functional development of the brain in utero. However, unpredictable and excessive movement of fetuses has limited clinical application since it causes substantial signal fluctuations which can systematically alter observed patterns of functional connectivity. Previous studies have focused on the accurate estimation of the motion parameters in case of large fetal head movement and used a 3D single step interpolation approach at each timepoint to recover motion-free fMRI images. This does not guarantee that the reconstructed image corresponds to the minimum error representation of fMRI time series given the acquired data. Here, we propose a novel technique based on four dimensional iterative reconstruction of the scattered slices acquired during fetal fMRI. The accuracy of the proposed method was quantitatively evaluated on a group of real clinical fMRI fetuses. The results indicate improvements of reconstruction quality compared to the conventional 3D interpolation approach."
2111.11802,Pruning Self-attentions into Convolutional Layers in Single Path,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive performance over various computer vision tasks. However, modeling global correlations with multi-head self-attention (MSA) layers leads to two widely recognized issues: the massive computational resource consumption and the lack of intrinsic inductive bias for modeling local visual patterns. To solve both issues, we devise a simple yet effective method named Single-Path Vision Transformer pruning (SPViT), to efficiently and automatically compress the pre-trained ViTs into compact models with proper locality added. Specifically, we first propose a novel weight-sharing scheme between MSA and convolutional operations, delivering a single-path space to encode all candidate operations. In this way, we cast the operation search problem as finding which subset of parameters to use in each MSA layer, which significantly reduces the computational cost and optimization difficulty, and the convolution kernels can be well initialized using pre-trained MSA parameters. Relying on the single-path space, we introduce learnable binary gates to encode the operation choices in MSA layers. Similarly, we further employ learnable gates to encode the fine-grained MLP expansion ratios of FFN layers. In this way, our SPViT optimizes the learnable gates to automatically explore from a vast and unified search space and flexibly adjust the MSA-FFN pruning proportions for each individual dense model. We conduct extensive experiments on two representative ViTs showing that our SPViT achieves a new SOTA for pruning on ImageNet-1k. For example, our SPViT can trim 52.0% FLOPs for DeiT-B and get an impressive 0.6% top-1 accuracy gain simultaneously. The source code is available at https://github.com/ziplab/SPViT."
2111.12138,Multi-Modality Microscopy Image Style Transfer for Nuclei Segmentation,"Annotating microscopy images for nuclei segmentation is laborious and time-consuming. To leverage the few existing annotations, also across multiple modalities, we propose a novel microscopy-style augmentation technique based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Unlike other style transfer methods, it can not only deal with different cell assay types and lighting conditions, but also with different imaging modalities, such as bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. Using disentangled representations for content and style, we can preserve the structure of the original image while altering its style during augmentation. We evaluate our data augmentation on the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset consisting of various cell assays, lighting conditions, and imaging modalities. With our style augmentation, the segmentation accuracy of the two top-ranked Mask R-CNN-based nuclei segmentation algorithms in the competition increases significantly. Thus, our augmentation technique renders the downstream task more robust to the test data heterogeneity and helps counteract class imbalance without resampling of minority classes."
2111.12293,PTQ4ViT: Post-training quantization for vision transformers with twin   uniform quantization,"Quantization is one of the most effective methods to compress neural networks, which has achieved great success on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, vision transformers have demonstrated great potential in computer vision. However, previous post-training quantization methods performed not well on vision transformer, resulting in more than 1% accuracy drop even in 8-bit quantization. Therefore, we analyze the problems of quantization on vision transformers. We observe the distributions of activation values after softmax and GELU functions are quite different from the Gaussian distribution. We also observe that common quantization metrics, such as MSE and cosine distance, are inaccurate to determine the optimal scaling factor. In this paper, we propose the twin uniform quantization method to reduce the quantization error on these activation values. And we propose to use a Hessian guided metric to evaluate different scaling factors, which improves the accuracy of calibration at a small cost. To enable the fast quantization of vision transformers, we develop an efficient framework, PTQ4ViT. Experiments show the quantized vision transformers achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy (less than 0.5% drop at 8-bit quantization) on the ImageNet classification task."
2111.12664,MIO : Mutual Information Optimization using Self-Supervised Binary   Contrastive Learning,"Self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks have progressed rapidly over the last few years. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function for contrastive learning. We model our pre-training task as a binary classification problem to induce an implicit contrastive effect. We further improve the n\""aive loss function after removing the effect of the positive-positive repulsion and incorporating the upper bound of the negative pair repulsion. Unlike existing methods, the proposed loss function optimizes the mutual information in positive and negative pairs. We also present a closed-form expression for the parameter gradient flow and compare the behaviour of self-supervised contrastive frameworks using Hessian eigenspectrum to analytically study their convergence. The proposed method outperforms SOTA self-supervised contrastive frameworks on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet. After 200 pretraining epochs with ResNet-18 as the backbone, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 86.36%, 58.18%, 80.50%, and 30.87% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, respectively, and surpasses the SOTA contrastive baseline by 1.93%, 3.57%, 4.85%, and 0.33%, respectively. The proposed framework also achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 78.4% (200 epochs) and 65.22% (100 epochs) Top-1 Linear Evaluation accuracy on ImageNet100 and ImageNet1K datasets, respectively."
2111.12728,Online Adaptation for Implicit Object Tracking and Shape Reconstruction   in the Wild,"Tracking and reconstructing 3D objects from cluttered scenes are the key components for computer vision, robotics and autonomous driving systems. While recent progress in implicit function has shown encouraging results on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction, it is still very challenging to generalize to cluttered and partially observable LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose to leverage the continuity in video data. We introduce a novel and unified framework which utilizes a neural implicit function to simultaneously track and reconstruct 3D objects in the wild. Our approach adapts the DeepSDF model (i.e., an instantiation of the implicit function) in the video online, iteratively improving the shape reconstruction while in return improving the tracking, and vice versa. We experiment with both Waymo and KITTI datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both tracking and shape reconstruction tasks. Our project page is at https://jianglongye.com/implicit-tracking ."
2111.12924,Joint stereo 3D object detection and implicit surface reconstruction,"We present a new learning-based framework S-3D-RCNN that can recover accurate object orientation in SO(3) and simultaneously predict implicit rigid shapes from stereo RGB images. For orientation estimation, in contrast to previous studies that map local appearance to observation angles, we propose a progressive approach by extracting meaningful Intermediate Geometrical Representations (IGRs). This approach features a deep model that transforms perceived intensities from one or two views to object part coordinates to achieve direct egocentric object orientation estimation in the camera coordinate system. To further achieve finer description inside 3D bounding boxes, we investigate the implicit shape estimation problem from stereo images. We model visible object surfaces by designing a point-based representation, augmenting IGRs to explicitly address the unseen surface hallucination problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed IGRs, and S-3D-RCNN achieves superior 3D scene understanding performance. We also designed new metrics on the KITTI benchmark for our evaluation of implicit shape estimation."
2111.13230,FedDropoutAvg: Generalizable federated learning for histopathology image   classification,"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of a deep learning model without sharing the data of participating sites. FL in medical image analysis tasks is relatively new and open for enhancements. In this study, we propose FedDropoutAvg, a new federated learning approach for training a generalizable model. The proposed method takes advantage of randomness, both in client selection and also in federated averaging process. We compare FedDropoutAvg to several algorithms in an FL scenario for real-world multi-site histopathology image classification task. We show that with FedDropoutAvg, the final model can achieve performance better than other FL approaches and closer to a classical deep learning model that requires all data to be shared for centralized training. We test the trained models on a large dataset consisting of 1.2 million image tiles from 21 different centers. To evaluate the generalization ability of the proposed approach, we use held-out test sets from centers whose data was used in the FL and for unseen data from other independent centers whose data was not used in the federated training. We show that the proposed approach is more generalizable than other state-of-the-art federated training approaches. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to use a randomized client and local model parameter selection procedure in a federated setting for a medical image analysis task."
2111.13841,Adaptive Perturbation for Adversarial Attack,"In recent years, the security of deep learning models achieves more and more attentions with the rapid development of neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Almost all existing gradient-based attack methods use the sign function in the generation to meet the requirement of perturbation budget on $L_\infty$ norm. However, we find that the sign function may be improper for generating adversarial examples since it modifies the exact gradient direction. Instead of using the sign function, we propose to directly utilize the exact gradient direction with a scaling factor for generating adversarial perturbations, which improves the attack success rates of adversarial examples even with fewer perturbations. At the same time, we also theoretically prove that this method can achieve better black-box transferability. Moreover, considering that the best scaling factor varies across different images, we propose an adaptive scaling factor generator to seek an appropriate scaling factor for each image, which avoids the computational cost for manually searching the scaling factor. Our method can be integrated with almost all existing gradient-based attack methods to further improve their attack success rates. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets show that our method exhibits higher transferability and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
2111.13907,Pose Representations for Deep Skeletal Animation,"Data-driven character animation techniques rely on the existence of a properly established model of motion, capable of describing its rich context. However, commonly used motion representations often fail to accurately encode the full articulation of motion, or present artifacts. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of finding a robust pose representation for motion modeling, suitable for deep character animation, one that can better constrain poses and faithfully capture nuances correlated with skeletal characteristics. Our representation is based on dual quaternions, the mathematical abstractions with well-defined operations, which simultaneously encode rotational and positional orientation, enabling a hierarchy-aware encoding, centered around the root. We demonstrate that our representation overcomes common motion artifacts, and assess its performance compared to other popular representations. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of various losses that can be incorporated during learning. Leveraging the fact that our representation implicitly encodes skeletal motion attributes, we train a network on a dataset comprising of skeletons with different proportions, without the need to retarget them first to a universal skeleton, which causes subtle motion elements to be missed. We show that smooth and natural poses can be achieved, paving the way for fascinating applications."
2111.14259,Performance of a GPU- and Time-Efficient Pseudo 3D Network for Magnetic   Resonance Image Super-Resolution and Motion Artifact Reduction,"Shortening acquisition time and reducing motion artifacts are the most critical challenges in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting."
2111.14302,Self-supervised Feature-Gate Coupling for Dynamic Network Pruning,"Gating modules have been widely explored in dynamic network pruning to reduce the run-time computational cost of deep neural networks while preserving the representation of features. Despite the substantial progress, existing methods remain ignoring the consistency between feature and gate distributions, which may lead to distortion of gated features. In this paper, we propose a feature-gate coupling (FGC) approach aiming to align distributions of features and gates. FGC is a plug-and-play module, which consists of two steps carried out in an iterative self-supervised manner. In the first step, FGC utilizes the $k$-Nearest Neighbor method in the feature space to explore instance neighborhood relationships, which are treated as self-supervisory signals. In the second step, FGC exploits contrastive learning to regularize gating modules with generated self-supervisory signals, leading to the alignment of instance neighborhood relationships within the feature and gate spaces. Experimental results validate that the proposed FGC method improves the baseline approach with significant margins, outperforming the state-of-the-arts with better accuracy-computation trade-off. Code is publicly available."
2111.14482,High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images,"To segment 4K or 6K ultra high-resolution images needs extra computation consideration in image segmentation. Common strategies, such as down-sampling, patch cropping, and cascade model, cannot address well the balance issue between accuracy and computation cost. Motivated by the fact that humans distinguish among objects continuously from coarse to precise levels, we propose the Continuous Refinement Model~(CRM) for the ultra high-resolution segmentation refinement task. CRM continuously aligns the feature map with the refinement target and aggregates features to reconstruct these images' details. Besides, our CRM shows its significant generalization ability to fill the resolution gap between low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing ones. We present quantitative performance evaluation and visualization to show that our proposed method is fast and effective on image segmentation refinement.

2111.15000,Deformable ProtoPNet: An Interpretable Image Classifier Using Deformable   Prototypes,"We present a deformable prototypical part network (Deformable ProtoPNet), an interpretable image classifier that integrates the power of deep learning and the interpretability of case-based reasoning. This model classifies input images by comparing them with prototypes learned during training, yielding explanations in the form of ""this looks like that."" However, while previous methods use spatially rigid prototypes, we address this shortcoming by proposing spatially flexible prototypes. Each prototype is made up of several prototypical parts that adaptively change their relative spatial positions depending on the input image. Consequently, a Deformable ProtoPNet can explicitly capture pose variations and context, improving both model accuracy and the richness of explanations provided. Compared to other case-based interpretable models using prototypes, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and gives an explanation with greater context. The code is available at https://github.com/jdonnelly36/Deformable-ProtoPNet."
2111.15124,In-Bed Human Pose Estimation from Unseen and Privacy-Preserving Image   Domains,"Medical applications have benefited greatly from the rapid advancement in computer vision. Considering patient monitoring in particular, in-bed human posture estimation offers important health-related metrics with potential value in medical condition assessments. Despite great progress in this domain, it remains challenging due to substantial ambiguity during occlusions, and the lack of large corpora of manually labeled data for model training, particularly with domains such as thermal infrared imaging which are privacy-preserving, and thus of great interest. Motivated by the effectiveness of self-supervised methods in learning features directly from data, we propose a multi-modal conditional variational autoencoder (MC-VAE) capable of reconstructing features from missing modalities seen during training. This approach is used with HRNet to enable single modality inference for in-bed pose estimation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that body positions can be effectively recognized from the available modality, achieving on par results with baseline models that are highly dependent on having access to multiple modes at inference time. The proposed framework supports future research towards self-supervised learning that generates a robust model from a single source, and expects it to generalize over many unknown distributions in clinical environments."
2111.15483,ST-MFNet: A Spatio-Temporal Multi-Flow Network for Frame Interpolation,"Video frame interpolation (VFI) is currently a very active research topic, with applications spanning computer vision, post production and video encoding. VFI can be extremely challenging, particularly in sequences containing large motions, occlusions or dynamic textures, where existing approaches fail to offer perceptually robust interpolation performance. In this context, we present a novel deep learning based VFI method, ST-MFNet, based on a Spatio-Temporal Multi-Flow architecture. ST-MFNet employs a new multi-scale multi-flow predictor to estimate many-to-one intermediate flows, which are combined with conventional one-to-one optical flows to capture both large and complex motions. In order to enhance interpolation performance for various textures, a 3D CNN is also employed to model the content dynamics over an extended temporal window. Moreover, ST-MFNet has been trained within an ST-GAN framework, which was originally developed for texture synthesis, with the aim of further improving perceptual interpolation quality. Our approach has been comprehensively evaluated -- compared with fourteen state-of-the-art VFI algorithms -- clearly demonstrating that ST-MFNet consistently outperforms these benchmarks on varied and representative test datasets, with significant gains up to 1.09dB in PSNR for cases including large motions and dynamic textures.

2112.00821,FaSS-MVS -- Fast Multi-View Stereo with Surface-Aware Semi-Global   Matching from UAV-borne Monocular Imagery,"With FaSS-MVS, we present an approach for fast multi-view stereo with surface-aware Semi-Global Matching that allows for rapid depth and normal map estimation from monocular aerial video data captured by UAVs. The data estimated by FaSS-MVS, in turn, facilitates online 3D mapping, meaning that a 3D map of the scene is immediately and incrementally generated while the image data is acquired or being received. FaSS-MVS is comprised of a hierarchical processing scheme in which depth and normal data, as well as corresponding confidence scores, are estimated in a coarse-to-fine manner, allowing to efficiently process large scene depths which are inherent to oblique imagery captured by low-flying UAVs. The actual depth estimation employs a plane-sweep algorithm for dense multi-image matching to produce depth hypotheses from which the actual depth map is extracted by means of a surface-aware semi-global optimization, reducing the fronto-parallel bias of SGM. Given the estimated depth map, the pixel-wise surface normal information is then computed by reprojecting the depth map into a point cloud and calculating the normal vectors within a confined local neighborhood. In a thorough quantitative and ablative study we show that the accuracies of the 3D information calculated by FaSS-MVS is close to that of state-of-the-art approaches for offline multi-view stereo, with the error not even being one magnitude higher than that of COLMAP. At the same time, however, the average run-time of FaSS-MVS to estimate a single depth and normal map is less than 14 % of that of COLMAP, allowing to perform an online and incremental processing of Full-HD imagery at 1-2 Hz."
2112.00941,Generalized Closed-form Formulae for Feature-based Subpixel Alignment in   Patch-based Matching,"Cost-based image patch matching is at the core of various techniques in computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing. When the subpixel disparity between the reference patch in the source and target images is required, either the cost function or the target image have to be interpolated. While cost-based interpolation is the easiest to implement, multiple works have shown that image based interpolation can increase the accuracy of the subpixel matching, but usually at the cost of expensive search procedures. This, however, is problematic, especially for very computation intensive applications such as stereo matching or optical flow computation. In this paper, we show that closed form formulae for subpixel disparity computation for the case of one dimensional matching, e.g., in the case of rectified stereo images where the search space is of one dimension, exists when using the standard NCC, SSD and SAD cost functions. We then demonstrate how to generalize the proposed formulae to the case of high dimensional search spaces, which is required for unrectified stereo matching and optical flow extraction. We also compare our results with traditional cost volume interpolation formulae as well as with state-of-the-art cost-based refinement methods, and show that the proposed formulae bring a small improvement over the state-of-the-art cost-based methods in the case of one dimensional search spaces, and a significant improvement when the search space is two dimensional."
2112.01525,Co-domain Symmetry for Complex-Valued Deep Learning,"We study complex-valued scaling as a type of symmetry natural and unique to complex-valued measurements and representations. Deep Complex Networks (DCN) extends real-valued algebra to the complex domain without addressing complex-valued scaling. SurReal takes a restrictive manifold view of complex numbers, adopting a distance metric to achieve complex-scaling invariance while losing rich complex-valued information. We analyze complex-valued scaling as a co-domain transformation and design novel equivariant and invariant neural network layer functions for this special transformation. We also propose novel complex-valued representations of RGB images, where complex-valued scaling indicates hue shift or correlated changes across color channels. Benchmarked on MSTAR, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN, our co-domain symmetric (CDS) classifiers deliver higher accuracy, better generalization, robustness to co-domain transformations, and lower model bias and variance than DCN and SurReal with far fewer parameters."
2112.01601,Is RobustBench/AutoAttack a suitable Benchmark for Adversarial   Robustness?,"Recently, RobustBench (Croce et al. 2020) has become a widely recognized benchmark for the adversarial robustness of image classification networks. In its most commonly reported sub-task, RobustBench evaluates and ranks the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks on CIFAR10 under AutoAttack (Croce and Hein 2020b) with l-inf perturbations limited to eps = 8/255. With leading scores of the currently best performing models of around 60% of the baseline, it is fair to characterize this benchmark to be quite challenging. Despite its general acceptance in recent literature, we aim to foster discussion about the suitability of RobustBench as a key indicator for robustness which could be generalized to practical applications. Our line of argumentation against this is two-fold and supported by excessive experiments presented in this paper: We argue that I) the alternation of data by AutoAttack with l-inf, eps = 8/255 is unrealistically strong, resulting in close to perfect detection rates of adversarial samples even by simple detection algorithms and human observers. We also show that other attack methods are much harder to detect while achieving similar success rates. II) That results on low-resolution data sets like CIFAR10 do not generalize well to higher resolution images as gradient-based attacks appear to become even more detectable with increasing resolutions."
2112.01784,Fully automatic integration of dental CBCT images and full-arch   intraoral impressions with stitching error correction via individual tooth   segmentation and identification,"We present a fully automated method of integrating intraoral scan (IOS) and dental cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) images into one image by complementing each image's weaknesses. Dental CBCT alone may not be able to delineate precise details of the tooth surface due to limited image resolution and various CBCT artifacts, including metal-induced artifacts. IOS is very accurate for the scanning of narrow areas, but it produces cumulative stitching errors during full-arch scanning. The proposed method is intended not only to compensate the low-quality of CBCT-derived tooth surfaces with IOS, but also to correct the cumulative stitching errors of IOS across the entire dental arch. Moreover, the integration provide both gingival structure of IOS and tooth roots of CBCT in one image. The proposed fully automated method consists of four parts; (i) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for IOS data (TSIM-IOS); (ii) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for CBCT data (TSIM-CBCT); (iii) global-to-local tooth registration between IOS and CBCT; and (iv) stitching error correction of full-arch IOS. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved landmark and surface distance errors of 112.4 $\mu$m and 301.7 $\mu$m, respectively."
2112.01799,Global Context with Discrete Diffusion in Vector Quantised Modelling for   Image Generation,"The integration of Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) with autoregressive models as generation part has yielded high-quality results on image generation. However, the autoregressive models will strictly follow the progressive scanning order during the sampling phase. This leads the existing VQ series models to hardly escape the trap of lacking global information. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in the continuous domain have shown a capability to capture the global context, while generating high-quality images. In the discrete state space, some works have demonstrated the potential to perform text generation and low resolution image generation. We show that with the help of a content-rich discrete visual codebook from VQ-VAE, the discrete diffusion model can also generate high fidelity images with global context, which compensates for the deficiency of the classical autoregressive model along pixel space. Meanwhile, the integration of the discrete VAE with the diffusion model resolves the drawback of conventional autoregressive models being oversized, and the diffusion model which demands excessive time in the sampling process when generating images. It is found that the quality of the generated images is heavily dependent on the discrete visual codebook. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Vector Quantised Discrete Diffusion Model (VQ-DDM) is able to achieve comparable performance to top-tier methods with low complexity. It also demonstrates outstanding advantages over other vectors quantised with autoregressive models in terms of image inpainting tasks without additional training."
2112.03860,Differentiable Gaussianization Layers for Inverse Problems Regularized   by Deep Generative Models,"Deep generative models such as GANs, normalizing flows, and diffusion models are powerful regularizers for inverse problems. They exhibit great potential for helping reduce ill-posedness and attain high-quality results. However, the latent tensors of such deep generative models can fall out of the desired high-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution during inversion, particularly in the presence of data noise and inaccurate forward models, leading to low-fidelity solutions. To address this issue, we propose to reparameterize and Gaussianize the latent tensors using novel differentiable data-dependent layers wherein custom operators are defined by solving optimization problems. These proposed layers constrain inverse problems to obtain high-fidelity in-distribution solutions. We validate our technique on three inversion tasks: compressive-sensing MRI, image deblurring, and eikonal tomography (a nonlinear PDE-constrained inverse problem) using two representative deep generative models: StyleGAN2 and Glow. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency."
2112.04386,Which images to label for few-shot medical landmark detection?,"The success of deep learning methods relies on the availability of well-labeled large-scale datasets. However, for medical images, annotating such abundant training data often requires experienced radiologists and consumes their limited time. Few-shot learning is developed to alleviate this burden, which achieves competitive performances with only several labeled data. However, a crucial yet previously overlooked problem in few-shot learning is about the selection of template images for annotation before learning, which affects the final performance. We herein propose a novel Sample Choosing Policy (SCP) to select ""the most worthy"" images for annotation, in the context of few-shot medical landmark detection. SCP consists of three parts: 1) Self-supervised training for building a pre-trained deep model to extract features from radiological images, 2) Key Point Proposal for localizing informative patches, and 3) Representative Score Estimation for searching the most representative samples or templates. The advantage of SCP is demonstrated by various experiments on three widely-used public datasets. For one-shot medical landmark detection, its use reduces the mean radial errors on Cephalometric and HandXray datasets by 14.2% (from 3.595mm to 3.083mm) and 35.5% (4.114mm to 2.653mm), respectively."
2112.04731,Mimicking the Oracle: An Initial Phase Decorrelation Approach for Class   Incremental Learning,"Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims at learning a multi-class classifier in a phase-by-phase manner, in which only data of a subset of the classes are provided at each phase. Previous works mainly focus on mitigating forgetting in phases after the initial one. However, we find that improving CIL at its initial phase is also a promising direction. Specifically, we experimentally show that directly encouraging CIL Learner at the initial phase to output similar representations as the model jointly trained on all classes can greatly boost the CIL performance. Motivated by this, we study the difference between a na\""ively-trained initial-phase model and the oracle model. Specifically, since one major difference between these two models is the number of training classes, we investigate how such difference affects the model representations. We find that, with fewer training classes, the data representations of each class lie in a long and narrow region; with more training classes, the representations of each class scatter more uniformly. Inspired by this observation, we propose Class-wise Decorrelation (CwD) that effectively regularizes representations of each class to scatter more uniformly, thus mimicking the model jointly trained with all classes (i.e., the oracle model). Our CwD is simple to implement and easy to plug into existing methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that CwD consistently and significantly improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods by around 1\% to 3\%. Code will be released."
2112.04744,Superpixel-Based Building Damage Detection from Post-earthquake Imagery   Using Deep Neural Networks,"Building damage detection after natural disasters like earthquakes is crucial for initiating effective emergency response actions. Remotely sensed very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery can provide vital information due to their ability to map the affected buildings with high geometric precision. However, we suffer from suboptimal performances in detecting damaged buildings due to earthquakes. This paper presents a novel superpixel based approach incorporates Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with a modified segmentation method, for more precise building damage detection from VHR imagery. Firstly, a modified Fast Scanning and Adaptive Merging method is extended to create initial over-segmentation. Secondly, the segments are properly merged based on the Region Adjacent Graph (RAG). Thirdly, a pre-trained DNN using Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders (SDAE-DNN) is presented, to exploit the rich semantic features for building damage detection. Experimental results on a WorldView-2 imagery from Nepal Earthquake of 2015 demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, which could boost detection accuracy through learning more intrinsic and discriminative features, which outperforms other methods using alternative classifiers."
2112.05074,"Critical configurations for two projective views, a new approach","The problem of structure from motion is concerned with recovering 3-dimensional structure of an object from a set of 2-dimensional images. Generally, all information can be uniquely recovered if enough images and image points are provided, but there are certain cases where unique recovery is impossible; these are called critical configurations. In this paper we use an algebraic approach to study the critical configurations for two projective cameras. We show that all critical configurations lie on quadric surfaces, and classify exactly which quadrics constitute a critical configuration. The paper also describes the relation between the different reconstructions when unique reconstruction is impossible."
2112.05151,Annotation-efficient cancer detection with report-guided lesion   annotation for deep learning-based prostate cancer detection in bpMRI,"Deep learning-based diagnostic performance increases with more annotated data, but large-scale manual annotations are expensive and labour-intensive. Experts evaluate diagnostic images during clinical routine, and write their findings in reports. Leveraging unlabelled exams paired with clinical reports could overcome the manual labelling bottleneck. We hypothesise that detection models can be trained semi-supervised with automatic annotations generated using model predictions, guided by sparse information from clinical reports. To demonstrate efficacy, we train clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) segmentation models, where automatic annotations are guided by the number of clinically significant findings in the radiology reports. We included 7,756 prostate MRI examinations, of which 3,050 were manually annotated. We evaluated prostate cancer detection performance on 300 exams from an external centre with histopathology-confirmed ground truth. Semi-supervised training improved patient-based diagnostic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from $87.2 \pm 0.8\%$ to $89.4 \pm 1.0\%$ ($P<10^{-4}$) and improved lesion-based sensitivity at one false positive per case from $76.4 \pm 3.8\%$ to $83.6 \pm 2.3\%$ ($P<10^{-4}$). Semi-supervised training was 14$\times$ more annotation-efficient for case-based performance and 6$\times$ more annotation-efficient for lesion-based performance. This improved performance demonstrates the feasibility of our training procedure. Source code is publicly available at github.com/DIAGNijmegen/Report-Guided-Annotation. Best csPCa detection algorithm is available at grand-challenge.org/algorithms/bpmri-cspca-detection-report-guided-annotations/."
2112.05303,Surrogate-based cross-correlation for particle image velocimetry,"This paper presents a novel surrogate-based cross-correlation (SBCC) framework to improve the correlation performance for practical particle image velocimetry~(PIV). The basic idea is that an optimized surrogate filter/image, replacing one raw image, will produce a more accurate and robust correlation signal. Specifically, the surrogate image is encouraged to generate perfect Gaussian-shaped correlation map to tracking particles (PIV image pair) while producing zero responses to image noise (context images). And the problem is formularized with an objective function composed of surrogate loss and consistency loss. As a result, the closed-form solution provides an efficient multivariate operator that could consider other negative context images. Compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods (background subtraction, robust phase correlation, etc.), our SBCC method exhibits significant performance improvement (accuracy and robustness) on the synthetic dataset and several challenging experimental PIV cases. Besides, our implementation with experimental details (\url{https://github.com/yongleex/SBCC}) is also available for interested researchers."
2112.05478,Critical configurations for three projective views,"The problem of structure from motion is concerned with recovering the 3-dimensional structure of an object from a set of 2-dimensional images taken by unknown cameras. Generally, all information can be uniquely recovered if enough images and point correspondences are provided, yet there are certain cases where unique recovery is impossible; these are called critical configurations. We use an algebraic approach to study the critical configurations for three projective cameras. We show that all critical configurations lie on the intersection of quadric surfaces, and classify exactly which intersections constitute a critical configuration."
2112.05755,Information Prebuilt Recurrent Reconstruction Network for Video   Super-Resolution,"The video super-resolution (VSR) method based on the recurrent convolutional network has strong temporal modeling capability for video sequences. However, the temporal receptive field of different recurrent units in the unidirectional recurrent network is unbalanced. Earlier reconstruction frames receive less spatio-temporal information, resulting in fuzziness or artifacts. Although the bidirectional recurrent network can alleviate this problem, it requires more memory space and fails to perform many tasks with low latency requirements. To solve the above problems, we propose an end-to-end information prebuilt recurrent reconstruction network (IPRRN), consisting of an information prebuilt network (IPNet) and a recurrent reconstruction network (RRNet). By integrating sufficient information from the front of the video to build the hidden state needed for the initially recurrent unit to help restore the earlier frames, the information prebuilt network balances the input information difference at different time steps. In addition, we demonstrate an efficient recurrent reconstruction network, which outperforms the existing unidirectional recurrent schemes in all aspects. Many experiments have verified the effectiveness of the network we propose, which can effectively achieve better quantitative and qualitative evaluation performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods."
2112.06242,Formulating Event-based Image Reconstruction as a Linear Inverse Problem   with Deep Regularization using Optical Flow,"Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that measure per-pixel brightness differences asynchronously. Recovering brightness from events is appealing since the reconstructed images inherit the high dynamic range (HDR) and high-speed properties of events; hence they can be used in many robotic vision applications and to generate slow-motion HDR videos. However, state-of-the-art methods tackle this problem by training an event-to-image Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which lacks explainability and is difficult to tune. In this work we show, for the first time, how tackling the combined problem of motion and brightness estimation leads us to formulate event-based image reconstruction as a linear inverse problem that can be solved without training an image reconstruction RNN. Instead, classical and learning-based regularizers are used to solve the problem and remove artifacts from the reconstructed images. The experiments show that the proposed approach generates images with visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods despite only using data from a short time interval. State-of-the-art results are achieved using an image denoising Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the regularization function. The proposed regularized formulation and solvers have a unifying character because they can be applied also to reconstruct brightness from the second derivative. Additionally, the formulation is attractive because it can be naturally combined with super-resolution, motion-segmentation and color demosaicing. Code is available at https://github.com/tub-rip/event_based_image_rec_inverse_problem"
2112.06433,Generate Point Clouds with Multiscale Details from Graph-Represented   Structures,"As details are missing in most representations of structures, the lack of controllability to more information is one of the major weaknesses in structure-based controllable point cloud generation. It is observable that definitions of details and structures are subjective. Details can be treated as structures on small scales. To represent structures in different scales at the same time, we present a graph-based representation of structures called the Multiscale Structure Graph (MSG). Given structures in multiple scales, similar patterns of local structures can be found at different scales, positions, and angles. The knowledge learned from a regional structure pattern shall be transferred to other similar patterns. An encoding and generation mechanism, namely the Multiscale Structure-based Point Cloud Generator (MSPCG) is proposed, which can simultaneously learn point cloud generation from local patterns with miscellaneous spatial properties. The proposed method supports multiscale editions on point clouds by editing the MSG. By generating point clouds from local structures and learning simultaneously in multiple scales, our MSPCG has better generalization ability and scalability. Trained on the ShapeNet, our MSPCG can generate point clouds from a given structure for unseen categories and indoor scenes. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods."
2112.06502,DGL-GAN: Discriminator Guided Learning for GAN Compression,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with high computation costs, e.g., BigGAN and StyleGAN2, have achieved remarkable results in synthesizing high-resolution images from random noise. Reducing the computation cost of GANs while keeping generating photo-realistic images is a challenging field. In this work, we propose a novel yet simple {\bf D}iscriminator {\bf G}uided {\bf L}earning approach for compressing vanilla {\bf GAN}, dubbed {\bf DGL-GAN}. Motivated by the phenomenon that the teacher discriminator may contain some meaningful information about both real images and fake images, we merely transfer the knowledge from the teacher discriminator via the adversarial interaction between the teacher discriminator and the student generator. We apply DGL-GAN to compress the two most representative large-scale vanilla GANs, i.e., StyleGAN2 and BigGAN. Experiments show that DGL-GAN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on both StyleGAN2 and BigGAN. Moreover, DGL-GAN is also effective in boosting the performance of original uncompressed GANs. Original uncompressed StyleGAN2 boosted with DGL-GAN achieves FID 2.65 on FFHQ, which achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/yuesongtian/DGL-GAN}"
2112.06772,hARMS: A Hardware Acceleration Architecture for Real-Time Event-Based   Optical Flow,"Event-based vision sensors produce asynchronous event streams with high temporal resolution based on changes in the visual scene. The properties of these sensors allow for accurate and fast calculation of optical flow as events are generated. Existing solutions for calculating optical flow from event data either fail to capture the true direction of motion due to the aperture problem, do not use the high temporal resolution of the sensor, or are too computationally expensive to be run in real time on embedded platforms. In this research, we first present a faster version of our previous algorithm, ARMS (Aperture Robust Multi-Scale flow). The new optimized software version (fARMS) significantly improves throughput on a traditional CPU. Further, we present hARMS, a hardware realization of the fARMS algorithm allowing for real-time computation of true flow on low-power, embedded platforms. The proposed hARMS architecture targets hybrid system-on-chip devices and was designed to maximize configurability and throughput. The hardware architecture and fARMS algorithm were developed with asynchronous neuromorphic processing in mind, abandoning the common use of an event frame and instead operating using only a small history of relevant events, allowing latency to scale independently of the sensor resolution. This change in processing paradigm improved the estimation of flow directions by up to 73% compared to the existing method and yielded a demonstrated hARMS throughput of up to 1.21 Mevent/s on the benchmark configuration selected. This throughput enables real-time performance and makes it the fastest known realization of aperture-robust, event-based optical flow to date."
2112.06979,The Brain Tumor Sequence Registration (BraTS-Reg) Challenge:   Establishing Correspondence Between Pre-Operative and Follow-up MRI Scans of   Diffuse Glioma Patients,"Registration of longitudinal brain MRI scans containing pathologies is challenging due to dramatic changes in tissue appearance. Although there has been progress in developing general-purpose medical image registration techniques, they have not yet attained the requisite precision and reliability for this task, highlighting its inherent complexity. Here we describe the Brain Tumor Sequence Registration (BraTS-Reg) challenge, as the first public benchmark environment for deformable registration algorithms focusing on estimating correspondences between pre-operative and follow-up scans of the same patient diagnosed with a diffuse brain glioma. The BraTS-Reg data comprise de-identified multi-institutional multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans, curated for size and resolution according to a canonical anatomical template, and divided into training, validation, and testing sets. Clinical experts annotated ground truth (GT) landmark points of anatomical locations distinct across the temporal domain. Quantitative evaluation and ranking were based on the Median Euclidean Error (MEE), Robustness, and the determinant of the Jacobian of the displacement field. The top-ranked methodologies yielded similar performance across all evaluation metrics and shared several methodological commonalities, including pre-alignment, deep neural networks, inverse consistency analysis, and test-time instance optimization per-case basis as a post-processing step. The top-ranked method attained the MEE at or below that of the inter-rater variability for approximately 60% of the evaluated landmarks, underscoring the scope for further accuracy and robustness improvements, especially relative to human experts. The aim of BraTS-Reg is to continue to serve as an active resource for research, with the data and online evaluation tools accessible at https://bratsreg.github.io/."
2112.07566,VALSE: A Task-Independent Benchmark for Vision and Language Models   Centered on Linguistic Phenomena,"We propose VALSE (Vision And Language Structured Evaluation), a novel benchmark designed for testing general-purpose pretrained vision and language (V&L) models for their visio-linguistic grounding capabilities on specific linguistic phenomena. VALSE offers a suite of six tests covering various linguistic constructs. Solving these requires models to ground linguistic phenomena in the visual modality, allowing more fine-grained evaluations than hitherto possible. We build VALSE using methods that support the construction of valid foils, and report results from evaluating five widely-used V&L models. Our experiments suggest that current models have considerable difficulty addressing most phenomena. Hence, we expect VALSE to serve as an important benchmark to measure future progress of pretrained V&L models from a linguistic perspective, complementing the canonical task-centred V&L evaluations."
2112.08455,Dense Video Captioning Using Unsupervised Semantic Information,"We introduce a method to learn unsupervised semantic visual information based on the premise that complex events can be decomposed into simpler events and that these simple events are shared across several complex events. We first employ a clustering method to group representations producing a visual codebook. Then, we learn a dense representation by encoding the co-occurrence probability matrix for the codebook entries. This representation leverages the performance of the dense video captioning task in a scenario with only visual features. For example, we replace the audio signal in the BMT method and produce temporal proposals with comparable performance. Furthermore, we concatenate the visual representation with our descriptor in a vanilla transformer method to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the captioning subtask compared to the methods that explore only visual features, as well as a competitive performance with multi-modal methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/valterlej/dvcusi."
2112.08626,Analysis and Evaluation of Kinect-based Action Recognition Algorithms,"Human action recognition still exists many challenging problems such as different viewpoints, occlusion, lighting conditions, human body size and the speed of action execution, although it has been widely used in different areas. To tackle these challenges, the Kinect depth sensor has been developed to record real time depth sequences, which are insensitive to the color of human clothes and illumination conditions. Many methods on recognizing human action have been reported in the literature such as HON4D, HOPC, RBD and HDG, which use the 4D surface normals, pointclouds, skeleton-based model and depth gradients respectively to capture discriminative information from depth videos or skeleton data. In this research project, the performance of four aforementioned algorithms will be analyzed and evaluated using five benchmark datasets, which cover challenging issues such as noise, change of viewpoints, background clutters and occlusions. We also implemented and improved the HDG algorithm, and applied it in cross-view action recognition using the UWA3D Multiview Activity dataset. Moreover, we used different combinations of individual feature vectors in HDG for performance evaluation. The experimental results show that our improvement of HDG outperforms other three state-of-the-art algorithms for cross-view action recognition."
2112.09532,Pixel Distillation: A New Knowledge Distillation Scheme for   Low-Resolution Image Recognition,"Previous knowledge distillation (KD) methods mostly focus on compressing network architectures, which is not thorough enough in deployment as some costs like transmission bandwidth and imaging equipment are related to the image size. Therefore, we propose Pixel Distillation that extends knowledge distillation into the input level while simultaneously breaking architecture constraints. Such a scheme can achieve flexible cost control for deployment, as it allows the system to adjust both network architecture and image quality according to the overall requirement of resources. Specifically, we first propose an input spatial representation distillation (ISRD) mechanism to transfer spatial knowledge from large images to student's input module, which can facilitate stable knowledge transfer between CNN and ViT. Then, a Teacher-Assistant-Student (TAS) framework is further established to disentangle pixel distillation into the model compression stage and input compression stage, which significantly reduces the overall complexity of pixel distillation and the difficulty of distilling intermediate knowledge. Finally, we adapt pixel distillation to object detection via an aligned feature for preservation (AFP) strategy for TAS, which aligns output dimensions of detectors at each stage by manipulating features and anchors of the assistant. Comprehensive experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/gyguo/PixelDistillation."
2112.09726,Soundify: Matching Sound Effects to Video,"In the art of video editing, sound helps add character to an object and immerse the viewer within a space. Through formative interviews with professional editors (N=10), we found that the task of adding sounds to video can be challenging. This paper presents Soundify, a system that assists editors in matching sounds to video. Given a video, Soundify identifies matching sounds, synchronizes the sounds to the video, and dynamically adjusts panning and volume to create spatial audio. In a human evaluation study (N=889), we show that Soundify is capable of matching sounds to video out-of-the-box for a diverse range of audio categories. In a within-subjects expert study (N=12), we demonstrate the usefulness of Soundify in helping video editors match sounds to video with lighter workload, reduced task completion time, and improved usability."
2112.09741,Envisioning Future Deep Learning Theories: Some Basic Concepts and   Characteristics,"To advance deep learning methodologies in the next decade, a theoretical framework for reasoning about modern neural networks is needed. While efforts are increasing toward demystifying why deep learning is so effective, a comprehensive picture remains lacking, suggesting that a better theory is possible. We argue that a future deep learning theory should inherit three characteristics: a \textit{hierarchically} structured network architecture, parameters \textit{iteratively} optimized using stochastic gradient-based methods, and information from the data that evolves \textit{compressively}. As an instantiation, we integrate these characteristics into a graphical model called \textit{neurashed}. This model effectively explains some common empirical patterns in deep learning. In particular, neurashed enables insights into implicit regularization, information bottleneck, and local elasticity. Finally, we discuss how neurashed can guide the development of deep learning theories."
2112.09873,An effective coaxiality measurement for twist drill based on line   structured light sensor,"Aiming at the accurate and effective coaxiality measurement for twist drill with irregular surface, an optical measurement mechanism is proposed in this paper. First, A high-precision rotation instrument based on four core units is designed, which can obtain the 3-D point cloud data of full angle for the twist drill. Second, in the data processing stage, an improved robust Gaussian mixture model is established for accurate and rapid blade back segmentation. To improve measurement efficiency, a rapid reconstruction method of the twist drill axis based on orthogonal synthesis is provided to locate the axial position of the maximum deviation from the benchmark by utilizing the extracted blade back data. Finally, by calculating the maximum radial Euclidean distance from the benchmark, the coaxiality error of the twist drill is obtained. Comparing with other measurement methods, experimental results show that our proposed method is effective with high precision of 3 um and high efficiency of less than 3 s/pc. The result demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, robust and automatic, it can be applied in many actual industrial scene."
2112.11018,A Theoretical View of Linear Backpropagation and Its Convergence,"Backpropagation (BP) is widely used for calculating gradients in deep neural networks (DNNs). Applied often along with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants, BP is considered as a de-facto choice in a variety of machine learning tasks including DNN training and adversarial attack/defense. Recently, a linear variant of BP named LinBP was introduced for generating more transferable adversarial examples for performing black-box attacks, by Guo et al. Although it has been shown empirically effective in black-box attacks, theoretical studies and convergence analyses of such a method is lacking. This paper serves as a complement and somewhat an extension to Guo et al.'s paper, by providing theoretical analyses on LinBP in neural-network-involved learning tasks, including adversarial attack and model training. We demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, LinBP can lead to faster convergence in these tasks in the same hyper-parameter settings, compared to BP. We confirm our theoretical results with extensive experiments."
2112.11679,Ghost-dil-NetVLAD: A Lightweight Neural Network for Visual Place   Recognition,"Visual place recognition (VPR) is a challenging task with the unbalance between enormous computational cost and high recognition performance. Thanks to the practical feature extraction ability of the lightweight convolution neural networks (CNNs) and the train-ability of the vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) layer, we propose a lightweight weakly supervised end-to-end neural network consisting of a front-ended perception model called GhostCNN and a learnable VLAD layer as a back-end. GhostCNN is based on Ghost modules that are lightweight CNN-based architectures. They can generate redundant feature maps using linear operations instead of the traditional convolution process, making a good trade-off between computation resources and recognition accuracy. To enhance our proposed lightweight model further, we add dilated convolutions to the Ghost module to get features containing more spatial semantic information, improving accuracy. Finally, rich experiments conducted on a commonly used public benchmark and our private dataset validate that the proposed neural network reduces the FLOPs and parameters of VGG16-NetVLAD by 99.04% and 80.16%, respectively. Besides, both models achieve similar accuracy."
2112.12989,Domain-Aware Continual Zero-Shot Learning,"Modern visual systems have a wide range of potential applications in vision tasks for natural science research, such as aiding in species discovery, monitoring animals in the wild, and so on. However, real-world vision tasks may experience changes in environmental conditions, leading to shifts in how captured images are presented. To address this issue, we introduce Domain-Aware Continual Zero-Shot Learning (DACZSL), a task to recognize images of unseen categories in continuously changing domains. Accordingly, we propose a Domain-Invariant Network (DIN) to learn factorized features for shifting domains and improved textual representation for unseen classes. DIN continually learns a global shared network for domain-invariant and task-invariant features, and per-task private networks for task-specific features. Furthermore, we enhance the dual network with class-wise learnable prompts to improve class-level text representation, thereby improving zero-shot prediction of future unseen classes. To evaluate DACZSL, we introduce two benchmarks, DomainNet-CZSL and iWildCam-CZSL. Our results show that DIN significantly outperforms existing baselines by over 5% in harmonic accuracy and over 1% in backward transfer and achieves a new SoTA."
2112.13060,Fight Perturbations with Perturbations: Defending Adversarial Attacks   via Neuron Influence,"The vulnerabilities of deep learning models towards adversarial attacks have attracted increasing attention, especially when models are deployed in security-critical domains. Numerous defense methods, including reactive and proactive ones, have been proposed for model robustness improvement. Reactive defenses, such as conducting transformations to remove perturbations, usually fail to handle large perturbations. The proactive defenses that involve retraining, suffer from the attack dependency and high computation cost. In this paper, we consider defense methods from the general effect of adversarial attacks that take on neurons inside the model. We introduce the concept of neuron influence, which can quantitatively measure neurons' contribution to correct classification. Then, we observe that almost all attacks fool the model by suppressing neurons with larger influence and enhancing those with smaller influence. Based on this, we propose \emph{Neuron-level Inverse Perturbation} (NIP), a novel defense against general adversarial attacks. It calculates neuron influence from benign examples and then modifies input examples by generating inverse perturbations that can in turn strengthen neurons with larger influence and weaken those with smaller influence."
2112.13064,CatchBackdoor: Backdoor Detection via Critical Trojan Neural Path   Fuzzing,"The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications has benefited from abundant pre-trained models. However, the backdoored pre-trained models can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream DNNs. Numerous backdoor detection methods have been proposed but are limited to two aspects: (1) high sensitivity on trigger size, especially on stealthy attacks (i.e., blending attacks and defense adaptive attacks); (2) rely heavily on benign examples for reverse engineering. To address these challenges, we empirically observed that trojaned behaviors triggered by various trojan attacks can be attributed to the trojan path, composed of top-$k$ critical neurons with more significant contributions to model prediction changes. Motivated by it, we propose CatchBackdoor, a detection method against trojan attacks. Based on the close connection between trojaned behaviors and trojan path to trigger errors, CatchBackdoor starts from the benign path and gradually approximates the trojan path through differential fuzzing. We then reverse triggers from the trojan path, to trigger errors caused by diverse trojaned attacks. Extensive experiments on MINST, CIFAR-10, and a-ImageNet datasets and 7 models (LeNet, ResNet, and VGG) demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor over the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of (1) \emph{effective} - it shows better detection performance, especially on stealthy attacks ($\sim$ $\times$ 2 on average); (2) \emph{extensible} - it is robust to trigger size and can conduct detection without benign examples."
2112.13341,AlertTrap: A study on object detection in remote insects trap monitoring   system using on-the-edge deep learning platform,"Fruit flies are one of the most harmful insect species to fruit yields. In AlertTrap, implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) architecture with different state-of-the-art backbone feature extractors such as MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 appears to be potential solutions for the real-time detection problem. SSD-MobileNetV1 and SSD-MobileNetV2 perform well and result in AP at 0.5 of 0.957 and 1.0, respectively. You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4-tiny outperforms the SSD family with 1.0 in AP at 0.5; however, its throughput velocity is considerably slower, which shows SSD models are better candidates for real-time implementation. We also tested the models with synthetic test sets simulating expected environmental disturbances. The YOLOv4-tiny had better tolerance to these disturbances than the SSD models. The Raspberry Pi system successfully gathered environmental data and pest counts, sending them via email over 4 G. However, running the full YOLO version in real time on Raspberry Pi is not feasible, indicating the need for a lighter object detection algorithm for future research. Among model candidates, YOLOv4-tiny generally performs best, with SSD-MobileNetV2 also comparable and sometimes better, especially in scenarios with synthetic disturbances. SSD models excel in processing time, enabling real-time, high-accuracy detection."
2112.14540,Res2NetFuse: A Novel Res2Net-based Fusion Method for Infrared and   Visible Images,"The fusion of visible light and infrared images has garnered significant attention in the field of imaging due to its pivotal role in various applications, including surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel fusion framework using Res2Net architecture, capturing features across diverse receptive fields and scales for effective extraction of global and local features. Our methodology is structured into three fundamental components: the first part involves the Res2Net-based encoder, followed by the second part, which encompasses the fusion layer, and finally, the third part, which comprises the decoder. The encoder based on Res2Net is utilized for extracting multi-scale features from the input image. Simultaneously, with a single image as input, we introduce a pioneering training strategy tailored for a Res2Net-based encoder. We further enhance the fusion process with a novel strategy based on the attention model, ensuring precise reconstruction by the decoder for the fused image. Experimental results unequivocally showcase our method's unparalleled fusion performance, surpassing existing techniques, as evidenced by rigorous subjective and objective evaluations."
2112.14968,A Novel Generator with Auxiliary Branch for Improving GAN Performance,"The generator in the generative adversarial network (GAN) learns image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner in which earlier layers learn the overall structure of the image and the latter ones refine the details. To propagate the coarse information well, recent works usually build their generators by stacking up multiple residual blocks. Although the residual block can produce a high-quality image as well as be trained stably, it often impedes the information flow in the network. To alleviate this problem, this brief introduces a novel generator architecture that produces the image by combining features obtained through two different branches: the main and auxiliary branches. The goal of the main branch is to produce the image by passing through the multiple residual blocks, whereas the auxiliary branch is to convey the coarse information in the earlier layer to the later one. To combine the features in the main and auxiliary branches successfully, we also propose a gated feature fusion module that controls the information flow in those branches. To prove the superiority of the proposed method, this brief provides extensive experiments using various standard datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LSUN, CelebA-HQ, AFHQ, and tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, we conducted various ablation studies to demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed method. Quantitative evaluations prove that the proposed method exhibits impressive GAN performance in terms of Inception score (IS) and Frechet inception distance (FID). For instance, the proposed method boosts the FID and IS scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset from 35.13 to 25.00 and 20.23 to 25.57, respectively."
2112.15411,Disjoint Contrastive Regression Learning for Multi-Sourced Annotations,"Large-scale datasets are important for the development of deep learning models. Such datasets usually require a heavy workload of annotations, which are extremely time-consuming and expensive. To accelerate the annotation procedure, multiple annotators may be employed to label different subsets of the data. However, the inconsistency and bias among different annotators are harmful to the model training, especially for qualitative and subjective tasks.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regression framework to address the disjoint annotations problem, where each sample is labeled by only one annotator and multiple annotators work on disjoint subsets of the data. To take account of both the intra-annotator consistency and inter-annotator inconsistency, two strategies are employed.Firstly, a contrastive-based loss is applied to learn the relative ranking among different samples of the same annotator, with the assumption that the ranking of samples from the same annotator is unanimous. Secondly, we apply the gradient reversal layer to learn robust representations that are invariant to different annotators. Experiments on the facial expression prediction task, as well as the image quality assessment task, verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework."
2201.01034,Uncovering the Over-smoothing Challenge in Image Super-Resolution:   Entropy-based Quantification and Contrastive Optimization,"PSNR-oriented models are a critical class of super-resolution models with applications across various fields. However, these models tend to generate over-smoothed images, a problem that has been analyzed previously from the perspectives of models or loss functions, but without taking into account the impact of data properties. In this paper, we present a novel phenomenon that we term the center-oriented optimization (COO) problem, where a model's output converges towards the center point of similar high-resolution images, rather than towards the ground truth. We demonstrate that the strength of this problem is related to the uncertainty of data, which we quantify using entropy. We prove that as the entropy of high-resolution images increases, their center point will move further away from the clean image distribution, and the model will generate over-smoothed images. Implicitly optimizing the COO problem, perceptual-driven approaches such as perceptual loss, model structure optimization, or GAN-based methods can be viewed. We propose an explicit solution to the COO problem, called Detail Enhanced Contrastive Loss (DECLoss). DECLoss utilizes the clustering property of contrastive learning to directly reduce the variance of the potential high-resolution distribution and thereby decrease the entropy. We evaluate DECLoss on multiple super-resolution benchmarks and demonstrate that it improves the perceptual quality of PSNR-oriented models. Moreover, when applied to GAN-based methods, such as RaGAN, DECLoss helps to achieve state-of-the-art performance, such as 0.093 LPIPS with 24.51 PSNR on 4x downsampled Urban100, validating the effectiveness and generalization of our approach."
2201.01410,Synthesizer Based Efficient Self-Attention for Vision Tasks,"Self-attention module shows outstanding competence in capturing long-range relationships while enhancing performance on vision tasks, such as image classification and image captioning. However, the self-attention module highly relies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among query-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product multiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the visual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the scale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy the internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems, this paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely, Synthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor features. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among query-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to learn the synthetic attention weight from visual information. The effectiveness of STT series is validated on the image classification and image caption. Experiments show that the proposed STT achieves competitive performance while keeping robustness compared to self-attention in the aforementioned vision tasks."
2201.01488,Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning via Discriminative and   Comparable One-class Classifiers,"The exemplar-free class incremental learning requires classification models to learn new class knowledge incrementally without retaining any old samples. Recently, the framework based on parallel one-class classifiers (POC), which trains a one-class classifier (OCC) independently for each category, has attracted extensive attention, since it can naturally avoid catastrophic forgetting. POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability due to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this challenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable One-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the basic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead of other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a trained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging to a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning new tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with the old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for new-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing the comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss to ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST, CIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves state-of-the-art performance."
2201.02110,Eye Know You Too: A DenseNet Architecture for End-to-end Eye Movement   Biometrics,"Eye movement biometrics (EMB) is a relatively recent behavioral biometric modality that may have the potential to become the primary authentication method in virtual- and augmented-reality devices due to their emerging use of eye-tracking sensors to enable foveated rendering techniques. However, existing EMB models have yet to demonstrate levels of performance that would be acceptable for real-world use. Deep learning approaches to EMB have largely employed plain convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but there have been many milestone improvements to convolutional architectures over the years including residual networks (ResNets) and densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNets). The present study employs a DenseNet architecture for end-to-end EMB and compares the proposed model against the most relevant prior works. The proposed technique not only outperforms the previous state of the art, but is also the first to approach a level of authentication performance that would be acceptable for real-world use."
2201.02625,FlexHDR: Modelling Alignment and Exposure Uncertainties for Flexible HDR   Imaging,"High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is of fundamental importance in modern digital photography pipelines and used to produce a high-quality photograph with well exposed regions despite varying illumination across the image. This is typically achieved by merging multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images taken at different exposures. However, over-exposed regions and misalignment errors due to poorly compensated motion result in artefacts such as ghosting. In this paper, we present a new HDR imaging technique that specifically models alignment and exposure uncertainties to produce high quality HDR results. We introduce a strategy that learns to jointly align and assess the alignment and exposure reliability using an HDR-aware, uncertainty-driven attention map that robustly merges the frames into a single high quality HDR image. Further, we introduce a progressive, multi-stage image fusion approach that can flexibly merge any number of LDR images in a permutation-invariant manner. Experimental results show our method can produce better quality HDR images with up to 1.1dB PSNR improvement to the state-of-the-art, and subjective improvements in terms of better detail, colours, and fewer artefacts."
2201.04435,Beyond the Visible: A Survey on Cross-spectral Face Recognition,"Cross-spectral face recognition (CFR) refers to recognizing individuals using face images stemming from different spectral bands, such as infrared versus visible. While CFR is inherently more challenging than classical face recognition due to significant variation in facial appearance caused by the modality gap, it is useful in many scenarios including night-vision biometrics and detecting presentation attacks. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have resulted in significant improvement in the performance of CFR systems. Given these developments, the contributions of this survey are three-fold. First, we provide an overview of CFR, by formalizing the CFR problem and presenting related applications. Secondly, we discuss the appropriate spectral bands for face recognition and discuss recent CFR methods, placing emphasis on deep neural networks. In particular we describe techniques that have been proposed to extract and compare heterogeneous features emerging from different spectral bands. We also discuss the datasets that have been used for evaluating CFR methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future lines of research on this topic."
2201.05071,Evaluation of Neural Networks Defenses and Attacks using NDCG and   Reciprocal Rank Metrics,"The problem of attacks on neural networks through input modification (i.e., adversarial examples) has attracted much attention recently. Being relatively easy to generate and hard to detect, these attacks pose a security breach that many suggested defenses try to mitigate. However, the evaluation of the effect of attacks and defenses commonly relies on traditional classification metrics, without adequate adaptation to adversarial scenarios. Most of these metrics are accuracy-based, and therefore may have a limited scope and low distinctive power. Other metrics do not consider the unique characteristics of neural networks functionality, or measure the effect of the attacks indirectly (e.g., through the complexity of their generation). In this paper, we present two metrics which are specifically designed to measure the effect of attacks, or the recovery effect of defenses, on the output of neural networks in multiclass classification tasks. Inspired by the normalized discounted cumulative gain and the reciprocal rank metrics used in information retrieval literature, we treat the neural network predictions as ranked lists of results. Using additional information about the probability of the rank enabled us to define novel metrics that are suited to the task at hand. We evaluate our metrics using various attacks and defenses on a pretrained VGG19 model and the ImageNet dataset. Compared to the common classification metrics, our proposed metrics demonstrate superior informativeness and distinctiveness."
2201.06070,ALA: Naturalness-aware Adversarial Lightness Attack,"Most researchers have tried to enhance the robustness of DNNs by revealing and repairing the vulnerability of DNNs with specialized adversarial examples. Parts of the attack examples have imperceptible perturbations restricted by Lp norm. However, due to their high-frequency property, the adversarial examples can be defended by denoising methods and are hard to realize in the physical world. To avoid the defects, some works have proposed unrestricted attacks to gain better robustness and practicality. It is disappointing that these examples usually look unnatural and can alert the guards. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Lightness Attack (ALA), a white-box unrestricted adversarial attack that focuses on modifying the lightness of the images. The shape and color of the samples, which are crucial to human perception, are barely influenced. To obtain adversarial examples with a high attack success rate, we propose unconstrained enhancement in terms of the light and shade relationship in images. To enhance the naturalness of images, we craft the naturalness-aware regularization according to the range and distribution of light. The effectiveness of ALA is verified on two popular datasets for different tasks (i.e., ImageNet for image classification and Places-365 for scene recognition)."
2201.06133,On Maximum-a-Posteriori estimation with Plug & Play priors and   stochastic gradient descent,"Bayesian methods to solve imaging inverse problems usually combine an explicit data likelihood function with a prior distribution that explicitly models expected properties of the solution. Many kinds of priors have been explored in the literature, from simple ones expressing local properties to more involved ones exploiting image redundancy at a non-local scale. In a departure from explicit modelling, several recent works have proposed and studied the use of implicit priors defined by an image denoising algorithm. This approach, commonly known as Plug & Play (PnP) regularisation, can deliver remarkably accurate results, particularly when combined with state-of-the-art denoisers based on convolutional neural networks. However, the theoretical analysis of PnP Bayesian models and algorithms is difficult and works on the topic often rely on unrealistic assumptions on the properties of the image denoiser. This papers studies maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation for Bayesian models with PnP priors. We first consider questions related to existence, stability and well-posedness, and then present a convergence proof for MAP computation by PnP stochastic gradient descent (PnP-SGD) under realistic assumptions on the denoiser used. We report a range of imaging experiments demonstrating PnP-SGD as well as comparisons with other PnP schemes."
2201.07610,Nonlinear Unknown Input Observability and Unknown Input Reconstruction:   The General Analytical Solution,"Observability is a fundamental structural property of any dynamic system and describes the possibility of reconstructing the state that characterizes the system from observing its inputs and outputs. Despite the huge effort made to study this property and to introduce analytical criteria able to check whether a dynamic system satisfies this property or not, there is no general analytical criterion to automatically check the state observability when the dynamics are also driven by unknown inputs. Here, we introduce the general analytical solution of this fundamental problem, often called the unknown input observability problem. This paper provides the general analytical solution of this problem, namely, it provides the systematic procedure, based on automatic computation (differentiation and matrix rank determination), that allows us to automatically check the state observability even in the presence of unknown inputs (Algorithm 6.1). A first solution of this problem was presented in the second part of the book: ""Observability: A New Theory Based on the Group of Invariance"" [45]. The solution presented by this paper completes the previous solution in [45]. In particular, the new solution exhaustively accounts for the systems that do not belong to the category of the systems that are ""canonic with respect to their unknown inputs"". The analytical derivations largely exploit several new concepts and analytical results introduced in [45]. Finally, as a simple consequence of the results here obtained, we also provide the answer to the problem of unknown input reconstruction which is intimately related to the problem of state observability. We illustrate the implementation of the new algorithm by studying the observability properties of a nonlinear system in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion, whose dynamics are driven by two unknown inputs and one known input."
2201.08295,DIVA-DAF: A Deep Learning Framework for Historical Document Image   Analysis,"Deep learning methods have shown strong performance in solving tasks for historical document image analysis. However, despite current libraries and frameworks, programming an experiment or a set of experiments and executing them can be time-consuming. This is why we propose an open-source deep learning framework, DIVA-DAF, which is based on PyTorch Lightning and specifically designed for historical document analysis. Pre-implemented tasks such as segmentation and classification can be easily used or customized. It is also easy to create one's own tasks with the benefit of powerful modules for loading data, even large data sets, and different forms of ground truth. The applications conducted have demonstrated time savings for the programming of a document analysis task, as well as for different scenarios such as pre-training or changing the architecture. Thanks to its data module, the framework also allows to reduce the time of model training significantly."
2201.08388,Steerable Pyramid Transform Enables Robust Left Ventricle Quantification,"Predicting cardiac indices has long been a focal point in the medical imaging community. While various deep learning models have demonstrated success in quantifying cardiac indices, they remain susceptible to mild input perturbations, e.g., spatial transformations, image distortions, and adversarial attacks. This vulnerability undermines confidence in using learning-based automated systems for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we describe a simple yet effective method to learn robust models for left ventricle (LV) quantification, encompassing cavity and myocardium areas, directional dimensions, and regional wall thicknesses. Our success hinges on employing the biologically inspired steerable pyramid transform (SPT) for fixed front-end processing, which offers three main benefits. First, the basis functions of SPT align with the anatomical structure of LV and the geometric features of the measured indices. Second, SPT facilitates weight sharing across different orientations as a form of parameter regularization and naturally captures the scale variations of LV. Third, the residual highpass subband can be conveniently discarded, promoting robust feature learning. Extensive experiments on the Cardiac-Dig benchmark show that our SPT-augmented model not only achieves reasonable prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also exhibits significantly improved robustness against input perturbations."
2201.08815,Learning from One and Only One Shot,"Humans can generalize from only a few examples and from little pretraining on similar tasks. Yet, machine learning (ML) typically requires large data to learn or pre-learn to transfer. Motivated by nativism and artificial general intelligence, we directly model human-innate priors in abstract visual tasks such as character and doodle recognition. This yields a white-box model that learns general-appearance similarity by mimicking how humans naturally ``distort'' an object at first sight. Using just nearest-neighbor classification on this cognitively-inspired similarity space, we achieve human-level recognition with only $1$--$10$ examples per class and no pretraining. This differs from few-shot learning that uses massive pretraining. In the tiny-data regime of MNIST, EMNIST, Omniglot, and QuickDraw benchmarks, we outperform both modern neural networks and classical ML. For unsupervised learning, by learning the non-Euclidean, general-appearance similarity space in a $k$-means style, we achieve multifarious visual realizations of abstract concepts by generating human-intuitive archetypes as cluster centroids."
2201.09196,Learning to Predict Gradients for Semi-Supervised Continual Learning,"A key challenge for machine intelligence is to learn new visual concepts without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Continual learning is aimed towards addressing this challenge. However, there is a gap between existing supervised continual learning and human-like intelligence, where human is able to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. How unlabeled data affects learning and catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning process remains unknown. To explore these issues, we formulate a new semi-supervised continual learning method, which can be generically applied to existing continual learning models. Specifically, a novel gradient learner learns from labeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. Hence, the unlabeled data could fit into the supervised continual learning method. Different from conventional semi-supervised settings, we do not hypothesize that the underlying classes, which are associated to the unlabeled data, are known to the learning process. In other words, the unlabeled data could be very distinct from the labeled data. We evaluate the proposed method on mainstream continual learning, adversarial continual learning, and semi-supervised learning tasks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification accuracy and backward transfer in the continual learning setting while achieving desired performance on classification accuracy in the semi-supervised learning setting. This implies that the unlabeled images can enhance the generalizability of continual learning models on the predictive ability on unseen data and significantly alleviate catastrophic forgetting. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/luoyan407/grad_prediction.git}."
2201.09207,Visual Object Tracking on Multi-modal RGB-D Videos: A Review,"The development of visual object tracking has continued for decades. Recent years, as the wide accessibility of the low-cost RGBD sensors, the task of visual object tracking on RGB-D videos has drawn much attention. Compared to conventional RGB-only tracking, the RGB-D videos can provide more information that facilitates objecting tracking in some complicated scenarios. The goal of this review is to summarize the relative knowledge of the research filed of RGB-D tracking. To be specific, we will generalize the related RGB-D tracking benchmarking datasets as well as the corresponding performance measurements. Besides, the existing RGB-D tracking methods are summarized in the paper. Moreover, we discuss the possible future direction in the field of RGB-D tracking."
2201.09407,Cross-Domain Document Layout Analysis Using Document Style Guide,"The document layout analysis (DLA) aims to decompose document images into high-level semantic areas (i.e., figures, tables, texts, and background). Creating a DLA framework with strong generalization capabilities is a challenge due to document objects are diversity in layout, size, aspect ratio, texture, etc. Many researchers devoted this challenge by synthesizing data to build large training sets. However, the synthetic training data has different styles and erratic quality. Besides, there is a large gap between the source data and the target data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cross-domain DLA framework based on document style guidance. We integrated the document quality assessment and the document cross-domain analysis into a unified framework. Our framework is composed of three components, Document Layout Generator (GLD), Document Elements Decorator(GED), and Document Style Discriminator(DSD). The GLD is used to document layout generates, the GED is used to document layout elements fill, and the DSD is used to document quality assessment and cross-domain guidance. First, we apply GLD to predict the positions of the generated document. Then, we design a novel algorithm based on aesthetic guidance to fill the document positions. Finally, we use contrastive learning to evaluate the quality assessment of the document. Besides, we design a new strategy to change the document quality assessment component into a document cross-domain style guide component. Our framework is an unsupervised document layout analysis framework. We have proved through numerous experiments that our proposed method has achieved remarkable performance."
2201.09450,UniFormer: Unifying Convolution and Self-attention for Visual   Recognition,"It is a challenging task to learn discriminative representation from images and videos, due to large local redundancy and complex global dependency in these visual data. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though CNNs can efficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small neighborhood, the limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global dependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively capture long-range dependency via self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among all the tokens lead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified transFormer (UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and self-attention in a concise transformer format. Different from the typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators in our UniFormer block are equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow and deep layers, allowing to tackle both redundancy and dependency for efficient and effective representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our UniFormer blocks into a new powerful backbone, and adopt it for various vision tasks from image to video domain, from classification to dense prediction. Without any extra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification. With only ImageNet-1K pre-training, it can simply achieve state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of downstream tasks, e.g., it obtains 82.9/84.8 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600, 60.9/71.2 top-1 accuracy on Sth-Sth V1/V2 video classification, 53.8 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on COCO object detection, 50.8 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 77.4 AP on COCO pose estimation. We further build an efficient UniFormer with 2-4x higher throughput. Code is available at https://github.com/Sense-X/UniFormer."
2201.09522,Accelerated Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging using Deep Reinforcement   Learning,"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers a unique perspective in the treatment of vascular diseases by creating a sequence of ultrasound-slices acquired from within the vessel. However, unlike conventional hand-held ultrasound, the thin catheter only provides room for a small number of physical channels for signal transfer from a transducer-array at the tip. For continued improvement of image quality and frame rate, we present the use of deep reinforcement learning to deal with the current physical information bottleneck. Valuable inspiration has come from the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where learned acquisition schemes have brought significant acceleration in image acquisition at competing image quality. To efficiently accelerate IVUS imaging, we propose a framework that utilizes deep reinforcement learning for an optimal adaptive acquisition policy on a per-frame basis enabled by actor-critic methods and Gumbel top-$K$ sampling."
2201.09884,AutoMC: Automated Model Compression based on Domain Knowledge and   Progressive search strategy,"Model compression methods can reduce model complexity on the premise of maintaining acceptable performance, and thus promote the application of deep neural networks under resource constrained environments. Despite their great success, the selection of suitable compression methods and design of details of the compression scheme are difficult, requiring lots of domain knowledge as support, which is not friendly to non-expert users. To make more users easily access to the model compression scheme that best meet their needs, in this paper, we propose AutoMC, an effective automatic tool for model compression. AutoMC builds the domain knowledge on model compression to deeply understand the characteristics and advantages of each compression method under different settings. In addition, it presents a progressive search strategy to efficiently explore pareto optimal compression scheme according to the learned prior knowledge combined with the historical evaluation information. Extensive experimental results show that AutoMC can provide satisfying compression schemes within short time, demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoMC."
2201.09929,Euclidean and Affine Curve Reconstruction,"We consider practical aspects of reconstructing planar curves with prescribed Euclidean or affine curvatures. These curvatures are invariant under the special Euclidean group and the equi-affine groups, respectively, and play an important role in computer vision and shape analysis. We discuss and implement algorithms for such reconstruction, and give estimates on how close reconstructed curves are relative to the closeness of their curvatures in appropriate metrics. Several illustrative examples are provided."
2201.10712,Toward Data-Driven STAP Radar,"Using an amalgamation of techniques from classical radar, computer vision, and deep learning, we characterize our ongoing data-driven approach to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) radar. We generate a rich example dataset of received radar signals by randomly placing targets of variable strengths in a predetermined region using RFView, a site-specific radio frequency modeling and simulation tool developed by ISL Inc. For each data sample within this region, we generate heatmap tensors in range, azimuth, and elevation of the output power of a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, which can be replaced with a desired test statistic. These heatmap tensors can be thought of as stacked images, and in an airborne scenario, the moving radar creates a sequence of these time-indexed image stacks, resembling a video. Our goal is to use these images and videos to detect targets and estimate their locations, a procedure reminiscent of computer vision algorithms for object detection$-$namely, the Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). The Faster R-CNN consists of a proposal generating network for determining regions of interest (ROI), a regression network for positioning anchor boxes around targets, and an object classification algorithm; it is developed and optimized for natural images. Our ongoing research will develop analogous tools for heatmap images of radar data. In this regard, we will generate a large, representative adaptive radar signal processing database for training and testing, analogous in spirit to the COCO dataset for natural images. As a preliminary example, we present a regression network in this paper for estimating target locations to demonstrate the feasibility of and significant improvements provided by our data-driven approach."
2201.10849,Predicting Knee Osteoarthritis Progression from Structural MRI using   Deep Learning,"Accurate prediction of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progression from structural MRI has a potential to enhance disease understanding and support clinical trials. Prior art focused on manually designed imaging biomarkers, which may not fully exploit all disease-related information present in MRI scan. In contrast, our method learns relevant representations from raw data end-to-end using Deep Learning, and uses them for progression prediction. The method employs a 2D CNN to process the data slice-wise and aggregate the extracted features using a Transformer. Evaluated on a large cohort (n=4,866), the proposed method outperforms conventional 2D and 3D CNN-based models and achieves average precision of $0.58\pm0.03$ and ROC AUC of $0.78\pm0.01$. This paper sets a baseline on end-to-end KOA progression prediction from structural MRI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MIPT-Oulu/OAProgressionMR."
2201.11192,ReforesTree: A Dataset for Estimating Tropical Forest Carbon Stock with   Deep Learning and Aerial Imagery,"Forest biomass is a key influence for future climate, and the world urgently needs highly scalable financing schemes, such as carbon offsetting certifications, to protect and restore forests. Current manual forest carbon stock inventory methods of measuring single trees by hand are time, labour, and cost-intensive and have been shown to be subjective. They can lead to substantial overestimation of the carbon stock and ultimately distrust in forest financing. The potential for impact and scale of leveraging advancements in machine learning and remote sensing technologies is promising but needs to be of high quality in order to replace the current forest stock protocols for certifications.   In this paper, we present ReforesTree, a benchmark dataset of forest carbon stock in six agro-forestry carbon offsetting sites in Ecuador. Furthermore, we show that a deep learning-based end-to-end model using individual tree detection from low cost RGB-only drone imagery is accurately estimating forest carbon stock within official carbon offsetting certification standards. Additionally, our baseline CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art satellite-based forest biomass and carbon stock estimates for this type of small-scale, tropical agro-forestry sites. We present this dataset to encourage machine learning research in this area to increase accountability and transparency of monitoring, verification and reporting (MVR) in carbon offsetting projects, as well as scaling global reforestation financing through accurate remote sensing."
2201.12382,Deep Learning Methods for Abstract Visual Reasoning: A Survey on Raven's   Progressive Matrices,"Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) domain encompasses problems solving which requires the ability to reason about relations among entities present in a given scene. While humans, generally, solve AVR tasks in a ""natural"" way, even without prior experience, this type of problems has proven difficult for current machine learning systems. The paper summarises recent progress in applying deep learning methods to solving AVR problems, as a proxy for studying machine intelligence. We focus on the most common type of AVR tasks -- the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs) -- and provide a comprehensive review of the learning methods and deep neural models applied to solve RPMs, as well as, the RPM benchmark sets. Performance analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches to solving RPMs leads to formulation of certain insights and remarks on the current and future trends in this area. We conclude the paper by demonstrating how real-world problems can benefit from the discoveries of RPM studies."
2201.12577,Volley Revolver: A Novel Matrix-Encoding Method for Privacy-Preserving   Neural Networks (Inference),"In this work, we present a novel matrix-encoding method that is particularly convenient for neural networks to make predictions in a privacy-preserving manner using homomorphic encryption. Based on this encoding method, we implement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classification over encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphic multiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can be calculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation, we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculating some of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediate results and thus complete the convolution operation.   In a public cloud with 40 vCPUs, our convolutional neural network implementation on the MNIST testing dataset takes $\sim$ 287 seconds to compute ten likelihoods of 32 encrypted images of size $28 \times 28$ simultaneously. The data owner only needs to upload one ciphertext ($\sim 19.8$ MB) encrypting these 32 images to the public cloud."
2201.13164,Imperceptible and Multi-channel Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural   Networks,"Recent researches demonstrate that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoored DNN model will behave maliciously when images containing backdoor triggers arrive. To date, existing backdoor attacks are single-trigger and single-target attacks, and the triggers of most existing backdoor attacks are obvious thus are easy to be detected or noticed. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and multi-channel backdoor attack against Deep Neural Networks by exploiting Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) steganography. Based on the proposed backdoor attack method, we implement two variants of backdoor attacks, i.e., N-to-N backdoor attack and N-to-One backdoor attack. Specifically, for a colored image, we utilize DCT steganography to construct the trigger on different channels of the image. As a result, the trigger is stealthy and natural. Based on the proposed method, we implement multi-target and multi-trigger backdoor attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the average attack success rate of the N-to-N backdoor attack is 93.95% on CIFAR-10 dataset and 91.55% on TinyImageNet dataset, respectively. The average attack success rate of N-to-One attack is 90.22% and 89.53% on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed backdoor attack does not affect the classification accuracy of the DNN model. Moreover, the proposed attack is demonstrated to be robust to the state-of-the-art backdoor defense (Neural Cleanse)."
2202.00232,Improving deep neural network generalization and robustness to   background bias via layer-wise relevance propagation optimization,"Features in images' backgrounds can spuriously correlate with the images' classes, representing background bias. They can influence the classifier's decisions, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans effect). The phenomenon generates deep neural networks (DNNs) that perform well on standard evaluation datasets but generalize poorly to real-world data. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) explains DNNs' decisions. Here, we show that the optimization of LRP heatmaps can minimize the background bias influence on deep classifiers, hindering shortcut learning. By not increasing run-time computational cost, the approach is light and fast. Furthermore, it applies to virtually any classification architecture. After injecting synthetic bias in images' backgrounds, we compared our approach (dubbed ISNet) to eight state-of-the-art DNNs, quantitatively demonstrating its superior robustness to background bias. Mixed datasets are common for COVID-19 and tuberculosis classification with chest X-rays, fostering background bias. By focusing on the lungs, the ISNet reduced shortcut learning. Thus, its generalization performance on external (out-of-distribution) test databases significantly surpassed all implemented benchmark models."
2202.02002,Scaling up Multi-domain Semantic Segmentation with Sentence Embeddings,"We propose an approach to semantic segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art supervised performance when applied in a zero-shot setting. It thus achieves results equivalent to those of the supervised methods, on each of the major semantic segmentation datasets, without training on those datasets. This is achieved by replacing each class label with a vector-valued embedding of a short paragraph that describes the class. The generality and simplicity of this approach enables merging multiple datasets from different domains, each with varying class labels and semantics. The resulting merged semantic segmentation dataset of over 2 Million images enables training a model that achieves performance equal to that of state-of-the-art supervised methods on 7 benchmark datasets, despite not using any images therefrom. By fine-tuning the model on standard semantic segmentation datasets, we also achieve a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art supervised segmentation on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-context at 60% and 65% mIoU, respectively. Based on the closeness of language embeddings, our method can even segment unseen labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization to unseen image domains and unseen labels, and that the method enables impressive performance improvements in downstream applications, including depth estimation and instance segmentation."
2202.02703,Multi-modal Sensor Fusion for Auto Driving Perception: A Survey,"Multi-modal fusion is a fundamental task for the perception of an autonomous driving system, which has recently intrigued many researchers. However, achieving a rather good performance is not an easy task due to the noisy raw data, underutilized information, and the misalignment of multi-modal sensors. In this paper, we provide a literature review of the existing multi-modal-based methods for perception tasks in autonomous driving. Generally, we make a detailed analysis including over 50 papers leveraging perception sensors including LiDAR and camera trying to solve object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Different from traditional fusion methodology for categorizing fusion models, we propose an innovative way that divides them into two major classes, four minor classes by a more reasonable taxonomy in the view of the fusion stage. Moreover, we dive deep into the current fusion methods, focusing on the remaining problems and open-up discussions on the potential research opportunities. In conclusion, what we expect to do in this paper is to present a new taxonomy of multi-modal fusion methods for the autonomous driving perception tasks and provoke thoughts of the fusion-based techniques in the future."
2202.02813,A Coding Framework and Benchmark towards Low-Bitrate Video Understanding,"Video compression is indispensable to most video analysis systems. Despite saving transportation bandwidth, it also deteriorates downstream video understanding tasks, especially at low-bitrate settings. To systematically investigate this problem, we first thoroughly review the previous methods, revealing that three principles, i.e., task-decoupled, label-free, and data-emerged semantic prior, are critical to a machine-friendly coding framework but are not fully satisfied so far. In this paper, we propose a traditional-neural mixed coding framework that simultaneously fulfills all these principles, by taking advantage of both traditional codecs and neural networks (NNs). On one hand, the traditional codecs can efficiently encode the pixel signal of videos but may distort the semantic information. On the other hand, highly non-linear NNs are proficient in condensing video semantics into a compact representation. The framework is optimized by ensuring that a transportation-efficient semantic representation of the video is preserved w.r.t. the coding procedure, which is spontaneously learned from unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner. The videos collaboratively decoded from two streams (codec and NN) are of rich semantics, as well as visually photo-realistic, empirically boosting several mainstream downstream video analysis task performances without any post-adaptation procedure. Furthermore, by introducing the attention mechanism and adaptive modeling scheme, the video semantic modeling ability of our approach is further enhanced. Finally, we build a low-bitrate video understanding benchmark with three downstream tasks on eight datasets, demonstrating the notable superiority of our approach. All codes, data, and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/tianyuan168326/VCS-Pytorch}."
2202.02952,Supervision by Denoising for Medical Image Segmentation,"Learning-based image reconstruction models, such as those based on the U-Net, require a large set of labeled images if good generalization is to be guaranteed. In some imaging domains, however, labeled data with pixel- or voxel-level label accuracy are scarce due to the cost of acquiring them. This problem is exacerbated further in domains like medical imaging, where there is no single ground truth label, resulting in large amounts of repeat variability in the labels. Therefore, training reconstruction networks to generalize better by learning from both labeled and unlabeled examples (called semi-supervised learning) is problem of practical and theoretical interest. However, traditional semi-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction often necessitate handcrafting a differentiable regularizer specific to some given imaging problem, which can be extremely time-consuming. In this work, we propose ""supervision by denoising"" (SUD), a framework that enables us to supervise reconstruction models using their own denoised output as soft labels. SUD unifies stochastic averaging and spatial denoising techniques under a spatio-temporal denoising framework and alternates denoising and model weight update steps in an optimization framework for semi-supervision. As example applications, we apply SUD to two problems arising from biomedical imaging -- anatomical brain reconstruction (3D) and cortical parcellation (2D) -- to demonstrate a significant improvement in the image reconstructions over supervised-only and stochastic averaging baselines."
2202.02980,3D Object Detection from Images for Autonomous Driving: A Survey,"3D object detection from images, one of the fundamental and challenging problems in autonomous driving, has received increasing attention from both industry and academia in recent years. Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning technologies, image-based 3D detection has achieved remarkable progress. Particularly, more than 200 works have studied this problem from 2015 to 2021, encompassing a broad spectrum of theories, algorithms, and applications. However, to date no recent survey exists to collect and organize this knowledge. In this paper, we fill this gap in the literature and provide the first comprehensive survey of this novel and continuously growing research field, summarizing the most commonly used pipelines for image-based 3D detection and deeply analyzing each of their components. Additionally, we also propose two new taxonomies to organize the state-of-the-art methods into different categories, with the intent of providing a more systematic review of existing methods and facilitating fair comparisons with future works. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also analyze the current challenges in the field and discuss future directions for image-based 3D detection research."
2202.03087,Unsupervised Long-Term Person Re-Identification with Clothes Change,"We investigate unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) with clothes change, a new challenging problem with more practical usability and scalability to real-world deployment. Most existing re-id methods artificially assume the clothes of every single person to be stationary across space and time. This condition is mostly valid for short-term re-id scenarios since an average person would often change the clothes even within a single day. To alleviate this assumption, several recent works have introduced the clothes change facet to re-id, with a focus on supervised learning person identity discriminative representation with invariance to clothes changes. Taking a step further towards this long-term re-id direction, we further eliminate the requirement of person identity labels, as they are significantly more expensive and more tedious to annotate in comparison to short-term person re-id datasets. Compared to conventional unsupervised short-term re-id, this new problem is drastically more challenging as different people may have similar clothes whilst the same person can wear multiple suites of clothes over different locations and times with very distinct appearance. To overcome such obstacles, we introduce a novel Curriculum Person Clustering (CPC) method that can adaptively regulate the unsupervised clustering criterion according to the clustering confidence. Experiments on three long-term person re-id datasets show that our CPC outperforms SOTA unsupervised re-id methods and even closely matches the supervised re-id models."
2202.03163,Patch-Based Stochastic Attention for Image Editing,"Attention mechanisms have become of crucial importance in deep learning in recent years. These non-local operations, which are similar to traditional patch-based methods in image processing, complement local convolutions. However, computing the full attention matrix is an expensive step with heavy memory and computational loads. These limitations curb network architectures and performances, in particular for the case of high resolution images. We propose an efficient attention layer based on the stochastic algorithm PatchMatch, which is used for determining approximate nearest neighbors. We refer to our proposed layer as a ""Patch-based Stochastic Attention Layer"" (PSAL). Furthermore, we propose different approaches, based on patch aggregation, to ensure the differentiability of PSAL, thus allowing end-to-end training of any network containing our layer. PSAL has a small memory footprint and can therefore scale to high resolution images. It maintains this footprint without sacrificing spatial precision and globality of the nearest neighbors, which means that it can be easily inserted in any level of a deep architecture, even in shallower levels. We demonstrate the usefulness of PSAL on several image editing tasks, such as image inpainting, guided image colorization, and single-image super-resolution. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ncherel/psal"
2202.03189,Optical skin: Sensor-integration-free multimodal flexible sensing,"The biological skin enables animals to sense various stimuli. Extensive efforts have been made recently to develop smart skin-like sensors to extend the capabilities of biological skins; however, simultaneous sensing of several types of stimuli in a large area remains challenging because this requires large-scale sensor integration with numerous wire connections. We propose a simple, highly sensitive, and multimodal sensing approach, which does not require integrating multiple sensors. The proposed approach is based on an optical interference technique, which can encode the information of various stimuli as a spatial pattern. In contrast to the existing approach, the proposed approach, combined with a deep neural network, enables us to freely select the sensing mode according to our purpose. As a key example, we demonstrate simultaneous sensing mode of three different physical quantities, contact force, contact location, and temperature, using a single soft material without requiring complex integration. Another unique property of the proposed approach is spatially continuous sensing with ultrahigh resolution of few tens of micrometers, which enables identifying the shape of the object in contact. Furthermore, we present a haptic soft device for a human-machine interface. The proposed approach encourages the development of high-performance optical skins."
2202.03323,Motion-Plane-Adaptive Inter Prediction in 360-Degree Video Coding,"Inter prediction is one of the key technologies enabling the high compression efficiency of modern video coding standards. 360-degree video needs to be mapped to the 2D image plane prior to coding in order to allow compression using existing video coding standards. The distortions that inevitably occur when mapping spherical data onto the 2D image plane, however, impair the performance of classical inter prediction techniques. In this paper, we propose a motion-plane-adaptive inter prediction technique (MPA) for 360-degree video that takes the spherical characteristics of 360-degree video into account. Based on the known projection format of the video, MPA allows to perform inter prediction on different motion planes in 3D space instead of having to work on the - in theory arbitrarily mapped - 2D image representation directly. We furthermore derive a motion-plane-adaptive motion vector prediction technique (MPA-MVP) that allows to translate motion information between different motion planes and motion models. Our proposed integration of MPA together with MPA-MVP into the state-of-the-art H.266/VVC video coding standard shows significant Bjontegaard Delta rate savings of 1.72% with a peak of 3.97% based on PSNR and 1.56% with a peak of 3.40% based on WS-PSNR compared to the VTM-14.2 baseline on average."
2202.03434,Multi-modal data generation with a deep metric variational autoencoder,"We present a deep metric variational autoencoder for multi-modal data generation. The variational autoencoder employs triplet loss in the latent space, which allows for conditional data generation by sampling in the latent space within each class cluster. The approach is evaluated on a multi-modal dataset consisting of otoscopy images of the tympanic membrane with corresponding wideband tympanometry measurements. The modalities in this dataset are correlated, as they represent different aspects of the state of the middle ear, but they do not present a direct pixel-to-pixel correlation. The approach shows promising results for the conditional generation of pairs of images and tympanograms, and will allow for efficient data augmentation of data from multi-modal sources."
2202.03482,Navigating Neural Space: Revisiting Concept Activation Vectors to   Overcome Directional Divergence,"With a growing interest in understanding neural network prediction strategies, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) have emerged as a popular tool for modeling human-understandable concepts in the latent space. Commonly, CAVs are computed by leveraging linear classifiers optimizing the separability of latent representations of samples with and without a given concept. However, in this paper we show that such a separability-oriented computation leads to solutions, which may diverge from the actual goal of precisely modeling the concept direction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the significant influence of distractor directions, i.e., signals unrelated to the concept, which are picked up by filters (i.e., weights) of linear models to optimize class-separability. To address this, we introduce pattern-based CAVs, solely focussing on concept signals, thereby providing more accurate concept directions. We evaluate various CAV methods in terms of their alignment with the true concept direction and their impact on CAV applications, including concept sensitivity testing and model correction for shortcut behavior caused by data artifacts. We demonstrate the benefits of pattern-based CAVs using the Pediatric Bone Age, ISIC2019, and FunnyBirds datasets with VGG, ResNet, ReXNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer as model architectures."
2202.03583,Multi-Label Classification of Thoracic Diseases using Dense   Convolutional Network on Chest Radiographs,"Traditional methods of identifying pathologies in X-ray images rely heavily on skilled human interpretation and are often time-consuming. The advent of deep learning techniques has enabled the development of automated disease diagnosis systems. Still, the performance of such systems is opaque to end-users and limited to detecting a single pathology. In this paper, we propose a multi-label disease prediction model that allows the detection of more than one pathology at a given test time. We use a dense convolutional neural network (DenseNet) for disease diagnosis. Our proposed model achieved the highest AUC score of 0.896 for the condition Cardiomegaly with an accuracy of 0.826, while the lowest AUC score was obtained for Nodule, at 0.655 with an accuracy of 0.66. To build trust in decision-making, we generated heatmaps on X-rays to visualize the regions where the model paid attention to make certain predictions. Our proposed automated disease prediction model obtained highly confident high-performance metrics in multi-label disease prediction tasks."
2202.04291,L2B: Learning to Bootstrap Robust Models for Combating Label Noise,"Deep neural networks have shown great success in representation learning. However, when learning with noisy labels (LNL), they can easily overfit and fail to generalize to new data. This paper introduces a simple and effective method, named Learning to Bootstrap (L2B), which enables models to bootstrap themselves using their own predictions without being adversely affected by erroneous pseudo-labels. It achieves this by dynamically adjusting the importance weight between real observed and generated labels, as well as between different samples through meta-learning. Unlike existing instance reweighting methods, the key to our method lies in a new, versatile objective that enables implicit relabeling concurrently, leading to significant improvements without incurring additional costs.   L2B offers several benefits over the baseline methods. It yields more robust models that are less susceptible to the impact of noisy labels by guiding the bootstrapping procedure more effectively. It better exploits the valuable information contained in corrupted instances by adapting the weights of both instances and labels. Furthermore, L2B is compatible with existing LNL methods and delivers competitive results spanning natural and medical imaging tasks including classification and segmentation under both synthetic and real-world noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the challenges of noisy labels, often necessitating few to no validation samples, and is well generalized to other tasks such as image segmentation. This not only positions it as a robust complement to existing LNL techniques but also underscores its practical applicability. The code and models are available at https://github.com/yuyinzhou/l2b."
2202.05267,On Real-time Image Reconstruction with Neural Networks for MRI-guided   Radiotherapy,"MRI-guidance techniques that dynamically adapt radiation beams to follow tumor motion in real-time will lead to more accurate cancer treatments and reduced collateral healthy tissue damage. The gold-standard for reconstruction of undersampled MR data is compressed sensing (CS) which is computationally slow and limits the rate that images can be available for real-time adaptation. Here, we demonstrate the use of automated transform by manifold approximation (AUTOMAP), a generalized framework that maps raw MR signal to the target image domain, to rapidly reconstruct images from undersampled radial k-space data. The AUTOMAP neural network was trained to reconstruct images from a golden-angle radial acquisition, a benchmark for motion-sensitive imaging, on lung cancer patient data and generic images from ImageNet. Model training was subsequently augmented with motion-encoded k-space data derived from videos in the YouTube-8M dataset to encourage motion robust reconstruction. We find that AUTOMAP-reconstructed radial k-space has equivalent accuracy to CS but with much shorter processing times after initial fine-tuning on retrospectively acquired lung cancer patient data. Validation of motion-trained models with a virtual dynamic lung tumor phantom showed that the generalized motion properties learned from YouTube lead to improved target tracking accuracy. Our work shows that AUTOMAP can achieve real-time, accurate reconstruction of radial data. These findings imply that neural-network-based reconstruction is potentially superior to existing approaches for real-time image guidance applications."
2202.05334,Learning the Pedestrian-Vehicle Interaction for Pedestrian Trajectory   Prediction,"In this paper, we study the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles and propose a novel neural network structure called the Pedestrian-Vehicle Interaction (PVI) extractor for learning the pedestrian-vehicle interaction. We implement the proposed PVI extractor on both sequential approaches (long short-term memory (LSTM) models) and non-sequential approaches (convolutional models). We use the Waymo Open Dataset that contains real-world urban traffic scenes with both pedestrian and vehicle annotations. For the LSTM-based models, our proposed model is compared with Social-LSTM and Social-GAN, and using our proposed PVI extractor reduces the average displacement error (ADE) and the final displacement error (FDE) by 7.46% and 5.24%, respectively. For the convolutional-based models, our proposed model is compared with Social-STGCNN and Social-IWSTCNN, and using our proposed PVI extractor reduces the ADE and FDE by 2.10% and 1.27%, respectively. The results show that the pedestrian-vehicle interaction influences pedestrian behavior, and the models using the proposed PVI extractor can capture the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles, and thereby outperform the compared methods."
2202.05383,Including Facial Expressions in Contextual Embeddings for Sign Language   Generation,"State-of-the-art sign language generation frameworks lack expressivity and naturalness which is the result of only focusing manual signs, neglecting the affective, grammatical and semantic functions of facial expressions. The purpose of this work is to augment semantic representation of sign language through grounding facial expressions. We study the effect of modeling the relationship between text, gloss, and facial expressions on the performance of the sign generation systems. In particular, we propose a Dual Encoder Transformer able to generate manual signs as well as facial expressions by capturing the similarities and differences found in text and sign gloss annotation. We take into consideration the role of facial muscle activity to express intensities of manual signs by being the first to employ facial action units in sign language generation. We perform a series of experiments showing that our proposed model improves the quality of automatically generated sign language."
2202.05628,Artemis: Articulated Neural Pets with Appearance and Motion synthesis,"We, humans, are entering into a virtual era and indeed want to bring animals to the virtual world as well for companion. Yet, computer-generated (CGI) furry animals are limited by tedious off-line rendering, let alone interactive motion control. In this paper, we present ARTEMIS, a novel neural modeling and rendering pipeline for generating ARTiculated neural pets with appEarance and Motion synthesIS. Our ARTEMIS enables interactive motion control, real-time animation, and photo-realistic rendering of furry animals. The core of our ARTEMIS is a neural-generated (NGI) animal engine, which adopts an efficient octree-based representation for animal animation and fur rendering. The animation then becomes equivalent to voxel-level deformation based on explicit skeletal warping. We further use a fast octree indexing and efficient volumetric rendering scheme to generate appearance and density features maps. Finally, we propose a novel shading network to generate high-fidelity details of appearance and opacity under novel poses from appearance and density feature maps. For the motion control module in ARTEMIS, we combine state-of-the-art animal motion capture approach with recent neural character control scheme. We introduce an effective optimization scheme to reconstruct the skeletal motion of real animals captured by a multi-view RGB and Vicon camera array. We feed all the captured motion into a neural character control scheme to generate abstract control signals with motion styles. We further integrate ARTEMIS into existing engines that support VR headsets, providing an unprecedented immersive experience where a user can intimately interact with a variety of virtual animals with vivid movements and photo-realistic appearance. We make available our ARTEMIS model and dynamic furry animal dataset at https://haiminluo.github.io/publication/artemis/."
2202.05941,Domain-Invariant Proposals based on a Balanced Domain Classifier for   Object Detection,"Object recognition from images means to automatically find object(s) of interest and to return their category and location information. Benefiting from research on deep learning, like convolutional neural networks~(CNNs) and generative adversarial networks, the performance in this field has been improved significantly, especially when training and test data are drawn from similar distributions. However, mismatching distributions, i.e., domain shifts, lead to a significant performance drop. In this paper, we build domain-invariant detectors by learning domain classifiers via adversarial training. Based on the previous works that align image and instance level features, we mitigate the domain shift further by introducing a domain adaptation component at the region level within Faster \mbox{R-CNN}. We embed a domain classification network in the region proposal network~(RPN) using adversarial learning. The RPN can now generate accurate region proposals in different domains by effectively aligning the features between them. To mitigate the unstable convergence during the adversarial learning, we introduce a balanced domain classifier as well as a network learning rate adjustment strategy. We conduct comprehensive experiments using four standard datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our object detection approach in domain shift scenarios."
2202.06095,A Review of Deep Learning-based Approaches for Deepfake Content   Detection,"Recent advancements in deep learning generative models have raised concerns as they can create highly convincing counterfeit images and videos. This poses a threat to people's integrity and can lead to social instability. To address this issue, there is a pressing need to develop new computational models that can efficiently detect forged content and alert users to potential image and video manipulations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent studies for deepfake content detection using deep learning-based approaches. We aim to broaden the state-of-the-art research by systematically reviewing the different categories of fake content detection. Furthermore, we report the advantages and drawbacks of the examined works, and prescribe several future directions towards the issues and shortcomings still unsolved on deepfake detection."
2202.06104,Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Geometry-aware   Consistency Training,"The performance of supervised deep learning methods for medical image segmentation is often limited by the scarcity of labeled data. As a promising research direction, semi-supervised learning addresses this dilemma by leveraging unlabeled data information to assist the learning process. In this paper, a novel geometry-aware semi-supervised learning framework is proposed for medical image segmentation, which is a consistency-based method. Considering that the hard-to-segment regions are mainly located around the object boundary, we introduce an auxiliary prediction task to learn the global geometric information. Based on the geometric constraint, the ambiguous boundary regions are emphasized through an exponentially weighted strategy for the model training to better exploit both labeled and unlabeled data. In addition, a dual-view network is designed to perform segmentation from different perspectives and reduce the prediction uncertainty. The proposed method is evaluated on the public left atrium benchmark dataset and improves fully supervised method by 8.7% in Dice with 10% labeled images, while 4.3% with 20% labeled images. Meanwhile, our framework outperforms six state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods."
2202.06198,Data standardization for robust lip sync,"Lip sync is a fundamental audio-visual task. However, existing lip sync methods fall short of being robust in the wild. One important cause could be distracting factors on the visual input side, making extracting lip motion information difficult. To address these issues, this paper proposes a data standardization pipeline to standardize the visual input for lip sync. Based on recent advances in 3D face reconstruction, we first create a model that can consistently disentangle lip motion information from the raw images. Then, standardized images are synthesized with disentangled lip motion information, with all other attributes related to distracting factors set to predefined values independent of the input, to reduce their effects. Using synthesized images, existing lip sync methods improve their data efficiency and robustness, and they achieve competitive performance for the active speaker detection task."
2202.06777,Multi-scale Attention Guided Pose Transfer,"Pose transfer refers to the probabilistic image generation of a person with a previously unseen novel pose from another image of that person having a different pose. Due to potential academic and commercial applications, this problem is extensively studied in recent years. Among the various approaches to the problem, attention guided progressive generation is shown to produce state-of-the-art results in most cases. In this paper, we present an improved network architecture for pose transfer by introducing attention links at every resolution level of the encoder and decoder. By utilizing such dense multi-scale attention guided approach, we are able to achieve significant improvement over the existing methods both visually and analytically. We conclude our findings with extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons against several existing methods on the DeepFashion dataset."
2202.06876,A Graphical Approach For Brain Haemorrhage Segmentation,"Haemorrhaging of the brain is the leading cause of death in people between the ages of 15 and 24 and the third leading cause of death in people older than that. Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality used to diagnose neurological emergencies, including stroke and traumatic brain injury. Recent advances in Deep Learning and Image Processing have utilised different modalities like CT scans to help automate the detection and segmentation of brain haemorrhage occurrences. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation of an architecture consisting of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) along with Graph Neural Networks(GNN) to produce a holistic model for the task of brain haemorrhage segmentation.GNNs work on the principle of neighbourhood aggregation thus providing a reliable estimate of global structures present in images. GNNs work with few layers thus in turn requiring fewer parameters to work with. We were able to achieve a dice coefficient score of around 0.81 with limited data with our implementation."
2202.06914,A Generic Self-Supervised Framework of Learning Invariant Discriminative   Features,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a popular method for generating invariant representations without the need for human annotations. Nonetheless, the desired invariant representation is achieved by utilising prior online transformation functions on the input data. As a result, each SSL framework is customised for a particular data type, e.g., visual data, and further modifications are required if it is used for other dataset types. On the other hand, autoencoder (AE), which is a generic and widely applicable framework, mainly focuses on dimension reduction and is not suited for learning invariant representation. This paper proposes a generic SSL framework based on a constrained self-labelling assignment process that prevents degenerate solutions. Specifically, the prior transformation functions are replaced with a self-transformation mechanism, derived through an unsupervised training process of adversarial training, for imposing invariant representations. Via the self-transformation mechanism, pairs of augmented instances can be generated from the same input data. Finally, a training objective based on contrastive learning is designed by leveraging both the self-labelling assignment and the self-transformation mechanism. Despite the fact that the self-transformation process is very generic, the proposed training strategy outperforms a majority of state-of-the-art representation learning methods based on AE structures. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on four types of data, namely visual, audio, text, and mass spectrometry data, and compare them in terms of four quantitative metrics. Our comparison results indicate that the proposed method demonstrate robustness and successfully identify patterns within the datasets."
2202.07572,On Representation Learning with Feedback,"This note complements the author's recent paper ""Robust representation learning with feedback for single image deraining"" by providing heuristically theoretical explanations on the mechanism of representation learning with feedback, namely an essential merit of the works presented in this recent article. This note facilitates understanding of key points in the mechanism of representation learning with feedback."
2202.07727,A Subjective Quality Study for Video Frame Interpolation,"Video frame interpolation (VFI) is one of the fundamental research areas in video processing and there has been extensive research on novel and enhanced interpolation algorithms. The same is not true for quality assessment of the interpolated content. In this paper, we describe a subjective quality study for VFI based on a newly developed video database, BVI-VFI. BVI-VFI contains 36 reference sequences at three different frame rates and 180 distorted videos generated using five conventional and learning based VFI algorithms. Subjective opinion scores have been collected from 60 human participants, and then employed to evaluate eight popular quality metrics, including PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS which are all commonly used for assessing VFI methods. The results indicate that none of these metrics provide acceptable correlation with the perceived quality on interpolated content, with the best-performing metric, LPIPS, offering a SROCC value below 0.6. Our findings show that there is an urgent need to develop a bespoke perceptual quality metric for VFI. The BVI-VFI dataset is publicly available and can be accessed at https://danier97.github.io/BVI-VFI/."
2202.07731,Enhancing Deformable Convolution based Video Frame Interpolation with   Coarse-to-fine 3D CNN,"This paper presents a new deformable convolution-based video frame interpolation (VFI) method, using a coarse to fine 3D CNN to enhance the multi-flow prediction. This model first extracts spatio-temporal features at multiple scales using a 3D CNN, and estimates multi-flows using these features in a coarse-to-fine manner. The estimated multi-flows are then used to warp the original input frames as well as context maps, and the warped results are fused by a synthesis network to produce the final output. This VFI approach has been fully evaluated against 12 state-of-the-art VFI methods on three commonly used test databases. The results evidently show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which offers superior interpolation performance over other state of the art algorithms, with PSNR gains up to 0.19dB."
2202.07817,Cross-view and Cross-domain Underwater Localization based on Optical   Aerial and Acoustic Underwater Images,Cross-view image matches have been widely explored on terrestrial image localization using aerial images from drones or satellites. This study expands the cross-view image match idea and proposes a cross-domain and cross-view localization framework. The method identifies the correlation between color aerial images and underwater acoustic images to improve the localization of underwater vehicles that travel in partially structured environments such as harbors and marinas. The approach is validated on a real dataset acquired by an underwater vehicle in a marina. The results show an improvement in the localization when compared to the dead reckoning of the vehicle.
2202.08498,"Mirror-Yolo: A Novel Attention Focus, Instance Segmentation and Mirror   Detection Model","Mirrors can degrade the performance of computer vision models, but research into detecting them is in the preliminary phase. YOLOv4 achieves phenomenal results in terms of object detection accuracy and speed, but it still fails in detecting mirrors. Thus, we propose Mirror-YOLO, which targets mirror detection, containing a novel attention focus mechanism for features acquisition, a hypercolumn-stairstep approach to better fusion the feature maps, and the mirror bounding polygons for instance segmentation. Compared to the existing mirror detection networks and YOLO series, our proposed network achieves superior performance in average accuracy on our proposed mirror dataset and another state-of-art mirror dataset, which demonstrates the validity and effectiveness of Mirror-YOLO."
2202.08730,Colonoscopy polyp detection with massive endoscopic images,"We improved an existing end-to-end polyp detection model with better average precision validated by different data sets with trivial cost on detection speed. Our previous work on detecting polyps within colonoscopy provided an efficient end-to-end solution to alleviate doctor's examination overhead. However, our later experiments found this framework is not as robust as before as the condition of polyp capturing varies. In this work, we conducted several studies on data set, identifying main issues that causes low precision rate in the task of polyp detection. We used an optimized anchor generation methods to get better anchor box shape and more boxes are used for detection as we believe this is necessary for small object detection. An alternative backbone is used to compensate the heavy time cost introduced by dense anchor box regression. With use of the attention gate module, our model can achieve state-of-the-art polyp detection performance while still maintain real-time detection speed."
2202.08835,General Cyclical Training of Neural Networks,"This paper describes the principle of ""General Cyclical Training"" in machine learning, where training starts and ends with ""easy training"" and the ""hard training"" happens during the middle epochs. We propose several manifestations for training neural networks, including algorithmic examples (via hyper-parameters and loss functions), data-based examples, and model-based examples. Specifically, we introduce several novel techniques: cyclical weight decay, cyclical batch size, cyclical focal loss, cyclical softmax temperature, cyclical data augmentation, cyclical gradient clipping, and cyclical semi-supervised learning. In addition, we demonstrate that cyclical weight decay, cyclical softmax temperature, and cyclical gradient clipping (as three examples of this principle) are beneficial in the test accuracy performance of a trained model. Furthermore, we discuss model-based examples (such as pretraining and knowledge distillation) from the perspective of general cyclical training and recommend some changes to the typical training methodology. In summary, this paper defines the general cyclical training concept and discusses several specific ways in which this concept can be applied to training neural networks. In the spirit of reproducibility, the code used in our experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/lnsmith54/CFL}."
2202.09014,How Well Do Self-Supervised Methods Perform in Cross-Domain Few-Shot   Learning?,"Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) remains a largely unsolved problem in the area of computer vision, while self-supervised learning presents a promising solution. Both learning methods attempt to alleviate the dependency of deep networks on the requirement of large-scale labeled data. Although self-supervised methods have recently advanced dramatically, their utility on CDFSL is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the role of self-supervised representation learning in the context of CDFSL via a thorough evaluation of existing methods. It comes as a surprise that even with shallow architectures or small training datasets, self-supervised methods can perform favorably compared to the existing SOTA methods. Nevertheless, no single self-supervised approach dominates all datasets indicating that existing self-supervised methods are not universally applicable. In addition, we find that representations extracted from self-supervised methods exhibit stronger robustness than the supervised method. Intriguingly, whether self-supervised representations perform well on the source domain has little correlation with their applicability on the target domain. As part of our study, we conduct an objective measurement of the performance for six kinds of representative classifiers. The results suggest Prototypical Classifier as the standard evaluation recipe for CDFSL."
2202.09061,VLP: A Survey on Vision-Language Pre-training,"In the past few years, the emergence of pre-training models has brought uni-modal fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) to a new era. Substantial works have shown they are beneficial for downstream uni-modal tasks and avoid training a new model from scratch. So can such pre-trained models be applied to multi-modal tasks? Researchers have explored this problem and made significant progress. This paper surveys recent advances and new frontiers in vision-language pre-training (VLP), including image-text and video-text pre-training. To give readers a better overall grasp of VLP, we first review its recent advances from five aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, pre-training objectives, pre-training datasets, and downstream tasks. Then, we summarize the specific VLP models in detail. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in VLP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey focused on VLP. We hope that this survey can shed light on future research in the VLP field."
2202.09573,Diversity in deep generative models and generative AI,"The decoder-based machine learning generative algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), Transformers show impressive results when constructing objects similar to those in a training ensemble. However, the generation of new objects builds mainly on the understanding of the hidden structure of the training dataset followed by a sampling from a multi-dimensional normal variable. In particular each sample is independent from the others and can repeatedly propose same type of objects. To cure this drawback we introduce a kernel-based measure quantization method that can produce new objects from a given target measure by approximating it as a whole and even staying away from elements already drawn from that distribution. This ensures a better diversity of the produced objects. The method is tested on classic machine learning benchmarks."
2202.09715,ARM3D: Attention-based relation module for indoor 3D object detection,"Relation context has been proved to be useful for many challenging vision tasks. In the field of 3D object detection, previous methods have been taking the advantage of context encoding, graph embedding, or explicit relation reasoning to extract relation context. However, there exists inevitably redundant relation context due to noisy or low-quality proposals. In fact, invalid relation context usually indicates underlying scene misunderstanding and ambiguity, which may, on the contrary, reduce the performance in complex scenes. Inspired by recent attention mechanism like Transformer, we propose a novel 3D attention-based relation module (ARM3D). It encompasses object-aware relation reasoning to extract pair-wise relation contexts among qualified proposals and an attention module to distribute attention weights towards different relation contexts. In this way, ARM3D can take full advantage of the useful relation context and filter those less relevant or even confusing contexts, which mitigates the ambiguity in detection. We have evaluated the effectiveness of ARM3D by plugging it into several state-of-the-art 3D object detectors and showing more accurate and robust detection results. Extensive experiments show the capability and generalization of ARM3D on 3D object detection. Our source code is available at https://github.com/lanlan96/ARM3D."
2202.09738,The Loop Game: Quality Assessment and Optimization for Low-Light Image   Enhancement,"There is an increasing consensus that the design and optimization of low light image enhancement methods need to be fully driven by perceptual quality. With numerous approaches proposed to enhance low-light images, much less work has been dedicated to quality assessment and quality optimization of low-light enhancement. In this paper, to close the gap between enhancement and assessment, we propose a loop enhancement framework that produces a clear picture of how the enhancement of low-light images could be optimized towards better visual quality. In particular, we create a large-scale database for QUality assessment Of The Enhanced LOw-Light Image (QUOTE-LOL), which serves as the foundation in studying and developing objective quality assessment measures. The objective quality assessment measure plays a critical bridging role between visual quality and enhancement and is further incorporated in the optimization in learning the enhancement model towards perceptual optimally. Finally, we iteratively perform the enhancement and optimization tasks, enhancing the low-light images continuously. The superiority of the proposed scheme is validated based on various low-light scenes."
2202.09918,SRL-SOA: Self-Representation Learning with Sparse 1D-Operational   Autoencoder for Hyperspectral Image Band Selection,"The band selection in the hyperspectral image (HSI) data processing is an important task considering its effect on the computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the band selection problem: Self-Representation Learning (SRL) with Sparse 1D-Operational Autoencoder (SOA). The proposed SLR-SOA approach introduces a novel autoencoder model, SOA, that is designed to learn a representation domain where the data are sparsely represented. Moreover, the network composes of 1D-operational layers with the non-linear neuron model. Hence, the learning capability of neurons (filters) is greatly improved with shallow architectures. Using compact architectures is especially crucial in autoencoders as they tend to overfit easily because of their identity mapping objective. Overall, we show that the proposed SRL-SOA band selection approach outperforms the competing methods over two HSI data including Indian Pines and Salinas-A considering the achieved land cover classification accuracies. The software implementation of the SRL-SOA approach is shared publicly at https://github.com/meteahishali/SRL-SOA."
2202.10185,OSegNet: Operational Segmentation Network for COVID-19 Detection using   Chest X-ray Images,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been diagnosed automatically using Machine Learning algorithms over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, most of the earlier studies used Deep Learning models over scarce datasets bearing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, previous studies have revealed the fact that deep networks are not reliable for classification since their decisions may originate from irrelevant areas on the CXRs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Operational Segmentation Network (OSegNet) that performs detection by segmenting COVID-19 pneumonia for a reliable diagnosis. To address the data scarcity encountered in training and especially in evaluation, this study extends the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 121,378 CXRs including 9258 COVID-19 samples with their corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks that are publicly shared with the research community. Consequently, OSegNet has achieved a detection performance with the highest accuracy of 99.65% among the state-of-the-art deep models with 98.09% precision."
2202.10240,Rethinking the Zigzag Flattening for Image Reading,"Sequence ordering of word vector matters a lot to text reading, which has been proven in natural language processing (NLP). However, the rule of different sequence ordering in computer vision (CV) was not well explored, e.g., why the ``zigzag"" flattening (ZF) is commonly utilized as a default option to get the image patches ordering in vision networks. Notably, when decomposing multi-scale images, the ZF could not maintain the invariance of feature point positions. To this end, we investigate the Hilbert fractal flattening (HF) as another method for sequence ordering in CV and contrast it against ZF. The HF has proven to be superior to other curves in maintaining spatial locality, when performing multi-scale transformations of dimensional space. And it can be easily plugged into most deep neural networks (DNNs). Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can yield consistent and significant performance boosts for a variety of architectures. Finally, we hope that our studies spark further research about the flattening strategy of image reading."
2202.10251,PointSCNet: Point Cloud Structure and Correlation Learning Based on   Space Filling Curve-Guided Sampling,"Geometrical structures and the internal local region relationship, such as symmetry, regular array, junction, etc., are essential for understanding a 3D shape. This paper proposes a point cloud feature extraction network named PointSCNet, to capture the geometrical structure information and local region correlation information of a point cloud. The PointSCNet consists of three main modules: the space-filling curve-guided sampling module, the information fusion module, and the channel-spatial attention module. The space-filling curve-guided sampling module uses Z-order curve coding to sample points that contain geometrical correlation. The information fusion module uses a correlation tensor and a set of skip connections to fuse the structure and correlation information. The channel-spatial attention module enhances the representation of key points and crucial feature channels to refine the network. The proposed PointSCNet is evaluated on shape classification and part segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the PointSCNet outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods by learning the structure and correlation of point clouds effectively."
2202.10704,Privacy-Preserving In-Bed Pose Monitoring: A Fusion and Reconstruction   Study,"Recently, in-bed human pose estimation has attracted the interest of researchers due to its relevance to a wide range of healthcare applications. Compared to the general problem of human pose estimation, in-bed pose estimation has several inherent challenges, the most prominent being frequent and severe occlusions caused by bedding. In this paper we explore the effective use of images from multiple non-visual and privacy-preserving modalities such as depth, long-wave infrared (LWIR) and pressure maps for the task of in-bed pose estimation in two settings. First, we explore the effective fusion of information from different imaging modalities for better pose estimation. Secondly, we propose a framework that can estimate in-bed pose estimation when visible images are unavailable, and demonstrate the applicability of fusion methods to scenarios where only LWIR images are available. We analyze and demonstrate the effect of fusing features from multiple modalities. For this purpose, we consider four different techniques: 1) Addition, 2) Concatenation, 3) Fusion via learned modal weights, and 4) End-to-end fully trainable approach; with a state-of-the-art pose estimation model. We also evaluate the effect of reconstructing a data-rich modality (i.e., visible modality) from a privacy-preserving modality with data scarcity (i.e., long-wavelength infrared) for in-bed human pose estimation. For reconstruction, we use a conditional generative adversarial network. We conduct ablative studies across different design decisions of our framework. This includes selecting features with different levels of granularity, using different fusion techniques, and varying model parameters. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our method produces on par or better results compared to the state-of-the-art."
2202.11203,Under-confidence Backdoors Are Resilient and Stealthy Backdoors,"By injecting a small number of poisoned samples into the training set, backdoor attacks aim to make the victim model produce designed outputs on any input injected with pre-designed backdoors. In order to achieve a high attack success rate using as few poisoned training samples as possible, most existing attack methods change the labels of the poisoned samples to the target class. This practice often results in severe over-fitting of the victim model over the backdoors, making the attack quite effective in output control but easier to be identified by human inspection or automatic defense algorithms.   In this work, we proposed a label-smoothing strategy to overcome the over-fitting problem of these attack methods, obtaining a \textit{Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack} (LSBA). In the LSBA, the label of the poisoned sample $\bm{x}$ will be changed to the target class with a probability of $p_n(\bm{x})$ instead of 100\%, and the value of $p_n(\bm{x})$ is specifically designed to make the prediction probability the target class be only slightly greater than those of the other classes. Empirical studies on several existing backdoor attacks show that our strategy can considerably improve the stealthiness of these attacks and, at the same time, achieve a high attack success rate. In addition, our strategy makes it able to manually control the prediction probability of the design output through manipulating the applied and activated number of LSBAs\footnote{Source code will be published at \url{https://github.com/v-mipeng/LabelSmoothedAttack.git}}."
2202.11703,Paying U-Attention to Textures: Multi-Stage Hourglass Vision Transformer   for Universal Texture Synthesis,"We present a novel U-Attention vision Transformer for universal texture synthesis. We exploit the natural long-range dependencies enabled by the attention mechanism to allow our approach to synthesize diverse textures while preserving their structures in a single inference. We propose a hierarchical hourglass backbone that attends to the global structure and performs patch mapping at varying scales in a coarse-to-fine-to-coarse stream. Completed by skip connection and convolution designs that propagate and fuse information at different scales, our hierarchical U-Attention architecture unifies attention to features from macro structures to micro details, and progressively refines synthesis results at successive stages. Our method achieves stronger 2$\times$ synthesis than previous work on both stochastic and structured textures while generalizing to unseen textures without fine-tuning. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of our architecture."
2202.12270,Evaluating Feature Attribution Methods in the Image Domain,"Feature attribution maps are a popular approach to highlight the most important pixels in an image for a given prediction of a model. Despite a recent growth in popularity and available methods, little attention is given to the objective evaluation of such attribution maps. Building on previous work in this domain, we investigate existing metrics and propose new variants of metrics for the evaluation of attribution maps. We confirm a recent finding that different attribution metrics seem to measure different underlying concepts of attribution maps, and extend this finding to a larger selection of attribution metrics. We also find that metric results on one dataset do not necessarily generalize to other datasets, and methods with desirable theoretical properties such as DeepSHAP do not necessarily outperform computationally cheaper alternatives. Based on these findings, we propose a general benchmarking approach to identify the ideal feature attribution method for a given use case. Implementations of attribution metrics and our experiments are available online."
2202.12361,RescueNet: A High Resolution UAV Semantic Segmentation Benchmark Dataset   for Natural Disaster Damage Assessment,"Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning techniques have facilitated notable progress in scene understanding, thereby assisting rescue teams in achieving precise damage assessment. In this paper, we present RescueNet, a meticulously curated high-resolution post-disaster dataset that includes detailed classification and semantic segmentation annotations. This dataset aims to facilitate comprehensive scene understanding in the aftermath of natural disasters. RescueNet comprises post-disaster images collected after Hurricane Michael, obtained using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from multiple impacted regions. The uniqueness of RescueNet lies in its provision of high-resolution post-disaster imagery, accompanied by comprehensive annotations for each image. Unlike existing datasets that offer annotations limited to specific scene elements such as buildings, RescueNet provides pixel-level annotations for all classes, including buildings, roads, pools, trees, and more. Furthermore, we evaluate the utility of the dataset by implementing state-of-the-art segmentation models on RescueNet, demonstrating its value in enhancing existing methodologies for natural disaster damage assessment."
2202.12435,Understanding Adversarial Robustness from Feature Maps of Convolutional   Layers,"The adversarial robustness of a neural network mainly relies on two factors: model capacity and anti-perturbation ability. In this paper, we study the anti-perturbation ability of the network from the feature maps of convolutional layers. Our theoretical analysis discovers that larger convolutional feature maps before average pooling can contribute to better resistance to perturbations, but the conclusion is not true for max pooling. It brings new inspiration to the design of robust neural networks and urges us to apply these findings to improve existing architectures. The proposed modifications are very simple and only require upsampling the inputs or slightly modifying the stride configurations of downsampling operators. We verify our approaches on several benchmark neural network architectures, including AlexNet, VGG, RestNet18, and PreActResNet18. Non-trivial improvements in terms of both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness can be achieved under various attack and defense mechanisms. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/MTandHJ/rcm}."
2202.13096,Continuous Human Action Recognition for Human-Machine Interaction: A   Review,"With advances in data-driven machine learning research, a wide variety of prediction models have been proposed to capture spatio-temporal features for the analysis of video streams. Recognising actions and detecting action transitions within an input video are challenging but necessary tasks for applications that require real-time human-machine interaction. By reviewing a large body of recent related work in the literature, we thoroughly analyse, explain and compare action segmentation methods and provide details on the feature extraction and learning strategies that are used on most state-of-the-art methods. We cover the impact of the performance of object detection and tracking techniques on human action segmentation methodologies. We investigate the application of such models to real-world scenarios and discuss several limitations and key research directions towards improving interpretability, generalisation, optimisation and deployment."
2202.13239,QOC: Quantum On-Chip Training with Parameter Shift and Gradient Pruning,"Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are drawing increasing research interest thanks to its potential to achieve quantum advantages on near-term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. In order to achieve scalable PQC learning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines instead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to obtain PQC gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the number of qubits. We present QOC, the first experimental demonstration of practical on-chip PQC training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that due to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients obtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrading the training accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient pruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then remove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than large ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive experiments with the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) benchmarks on 5 classification tasks using 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and 4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings up to 7% PQC accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we successfully obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free simulation but have much better training scalability. The QOC code is available in the TorchQuantum library."
2202.13393,TransKD: Transformer Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Semantic   Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation benchmarks in the realm of autonomous driving are dominated by large pre-trained transformers, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational costs and prolonged training durations. To lift this constraint, we look at efficient semantic segmentation from a perspective of comprehensive knowledge distillation and aim to bridge the gap between multi-source knowledge extractions and transformer-specific patch embeddings. We put forward the Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation (TransKD) framework which learns compact student transformers by distilling both feature maps and patch embeddings of large teacher transformers, bypassing the long pre-training process and reducing the FLOPs by >85.0%. Specifically, we propose two fundamental modules to realize feature map distillation and patch embedding distillation, respectively: (1) Cross Selective Fusion (CSF) enables knowledge transfer between cross-stage features via channel attention and feature map distillation within hierarchical transformers; (2) Patch Embedding Alignment (PEA) performs dimensional transformation within the patchifying process to facilitate the patch embedding distillation. Furthermore, we introduce two optimization modules to enhance the patch embedding distillation from different perspectives: (1) Global-Local Context Mixer (GL-Mixer) extracts both global and local information of a representative embedding; (2) Embedding Assistant (EA) acts as an embedding method to seamlessly bridge teacher and student models with the teacher's number of channels. Experiments on Cityscapes, ACDC, NYUv2, and Pascal VOC2012 datasets show that TransKD outperforms state-of-the-art distillation frameworks and rivals the time-consuming pre-training method. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RuipingL/TransKD."
2202.13524,Towards Class-agnostic Tracking Using Feature Decorrelation in Point   Clouds,"Single object tracking in point clouds has been attracting more and more attention owing to the presence of LiDAR sensors in 3D vision. However, the existing methods based on deep neural networks focus mainly on training different models for different categories, which makes them unable to perform well in real-world applications when encountering classes unseen during the training phase. In this work, we investigate a more challenging task in the LiDAR point clouds, class-agnostic tracking, where a general model is supposed to be learned for any specified targets of both observed and unseen categories. In particular, we first investigate the class-agnostic performances of the state-of-the-art trackers via exposing the unseen categories to them during testing, finding that a key factor for class-agnostic tracking is how to constrain fused features between the template and search region to maintain generalization when the distribution is shifted from observed to unseen classes. Therefore, we propose a feature decorrelation method to address this problem, which eliminates the spurious correlations of the fused features through a set of learned weights and further makes the search region consistent among foreground points and distinctive between foreground and background points. Experiments on the KITTI and NuScenes demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve considerable improvements by benchmarking against the advanced trackers P2B and BAT, especially when tracking unseen objects."
2202.13562,Name Your Style: An Arbitrary Artist-aware Image Style Transfer,"Image style transfer has attracted widespread attention in the past few years. Despite its remarkable results, it requires additional style images available as references, making it less flexible and inconvenient. Using text is the most natural way to describe the style. More importantly, text can describe implicit abstract styles, like styles of specific artists or art movements. In this paper, we propose a text-driven image style transfer (TxST) that leverages advanced image-text encoders to control arbitrary style transfer. We introduce a contrastive training strategy to effectively extract style descriptions from the image-text model (i.e., CLIP), which aligns stylization with the text description. To this end, we also propose a novel and efficient attention module that explores cross-attentions to fuse style and content features. Finally, we achieve an arbitrary artist-aware image style transfer to learn and transfer specific artistic characters such as Picasso, oil painting, or a rough sketch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both image and textual styles. Moreover, it can mimic the styles of one or many artists to achieve attractive results, thus highlighting a promising direction in image style transfer."
2202.13588,Using Multi-scale SwinTransformer-HTC with Data augmentation in CoNIC   Challenge,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, so early pathological examination is very important. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to identify the number and type of cells on H&E images in clinical. Therefore, automatic segmentation and classification task and counting the cellular composition of H&E images from pathological sections is proposed by CoNIC Challenge 2022. We proposed a multi-scale Swin transformer with HTC for this challenge, and also applied the known normalization methods to generate more augmentation data. Finally, our strategy showed that the multi-scale played a crucial role to identify different scale features and the augmentation arose the recognition of model."
2202.13777,Towards Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Domain-Transformer,"As a vital problem in pattern analysis and machine intelligence, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) attempts to transfer an effective feature learner from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Inspired by the success of the Transformer, several advances in UDA are achieved by adopting pure transformers as network architectures, but such a simple application can only capture patch-level information and lacks interpretability. To address these issues, we propose the Domain-Transformer (DoT) with domain-level attention mechanism to capture the long-range correspondence between the cross-domain samples. On the theoretical side, we provide a mathematical understanding of DoT: 1) We connect the domain-level attention with optimal transport theory, which provides interpretability from Wasserstein geometry; 2) From the perspective of learning theory, Wasserstein distance-based generalization bounds are derived, which explains the effectiveness of DoT for knowledge transfer. On the methodological side, DoT integrates the domain-level attention and manifold structure regularization, which characterize the sample-level information and locality consistency for cross-domain cluster structures. Besides, the domain-level attention mechanism can be used as a plug-and-play module, so DoT can be implemented under different neural network architectures. Instead of explicitly modeling the distribution discrepancy at domain-level or class-level, DoT learns transferable features under the guidance of long-range correspondence, so it is free of pseudo-labels and explicit domain discrepancy optimization. Extensive experiment results on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of DoT."
2202.13965,Precision-medicine-toolbox: An open-source python package for   facilitation of quantitative medical imaging and radiomics analysis,"Medical image analysis plays a key role in precision medicine as it allows the clinicians to identify anatomical abnormalities and it is routinely used in clinical assessment. Data curation and pre-processing of medical images are critical steps in the quantitative medical image analysis that can have a significant impact on the resulting model performance. In this paper, we introduce a precision-medicine-toolbox that allows researchers to perform data curation, image pre-processing and handcrafted radiomics extraction (via Pyradiomics) and feature exploration tasks with Python. With this open-source solution, we aim to address the data preparation and exploration problem, bridge the gap between the currently existing packages, and improve the reproducibility of quantitative medical imaging research."
2202.14005,"Deep, Deep Learning with BART","Purpose: To develop a deep-learning-based image reconstruction framework for reproducible research in MRI.   Methods: The BART toolbox offers a rich set of implementations of calibration and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging and compressed sensing. In this work, BART was extended by a non-linear operator framework that provides automatic differentiation to allow computation of gradients. Existing MRI-specific operators of BART, such as the non-uniform fast Fourier transform, are directly integrated into this framework and are complemented by common building blocks used in neural networks. To evaluate the use of the framework for advanced deep-learning-based reconstruction, two state-of-the-art unrolled reconstruction networks, namely the Variational Network [1] and MoDL [2], were implemented.   Results: State-of-the-art deep image-reconstruction networks can be constructed and trained using BART's gradient based optimization algorithms. The BART implementation achieves a similar performance in terms of training time and reconstruction quality compared to the original implementations based on TensorFlow.   Conclusion: By integrating non-linear operators and neural networks into BART, we provide a general framework for deep-learning-based reconstruction in MRI."
2203.00069,Optimal Transport-based Graph Matching for 3D retinal OCT image   registration,"Registration of longitudinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images assists disease monitoring and is essential in image fusion applications. Mouse retinal OCT images are often collected for longitudinal study of eye disease models such as uveitis, but their quality is often poor compared with human imaging. This paper presents a novel but efficient framework involving an optimal transport based graph matching (OT-GM) method for 3D mouse OCT image registration. We first perform registration of fundus-like images obtained by projecting all b-scans of a volume on a plane orthogonal to them, hereafter referred to as the x-y plane. We introduce Adaptive Weighted Vessel Graph Descriptors (AWVGD) and 3D Cube Descriptors (CD) to identify the correspondence between nodes of graphs extracted from segmented vessels within the OCT projection images. The AWVGD comprises scaling, translation and rotation, which are computationally efficient, whereas CD exploits 3D spatial and frequency domain information. The OT-GM method subsequently performs the correct alignment in the x-y plane. Finally, registration along the direction orthogonal to the x-y plane (the z-direction) is guided by the segmentation of two important anatomical features peculiar to mouse b-scans, the Internal Limiting Membrane (ILM) and the hyaloid remnant (HR). Both subjective and objective evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other well-established methods on mouse OCT images within a reasonable execution time."
2203.00156,Preemptive Motion Planning for Human-to-Robot Indirect Placement   Handovers,"As technology advances, the need for safe, efficient, and collaborative human-robot-teams has become increasingly important. One of the most fundamental collaborative tasks in any setting is the object handover. Human-to-robot handovers can take either of two approaches: (1) direct hand-to-hand or (2) indirect hand-to-placement-to-pick-up. The latter approach ensures minimal contact between the human and robot but can also result in increased idle time due to having to wait for the object to first be placed down on a surface. To minimize such idle time, the robot must preemptively predict the human intent of where the object will be placed. Furthermore, for the robot to preemptively act in any sort of productive manner, predictions and motion planning must occur in real-time. We introduce a novel prediction-planning pipeline that allows the robot to preemptively move towards the human agent's intended placement location using gaze and gestures as model inputs. In this paper, we investigate the performance and drawbacks of our early intent predictor-planner as well as the practical benefits of using such a pipeline through a human-robot case study."
2203.00187,Robots Autonomously Detecting People: A Multimodal Deep Contrastive   Learning Method Robust to Intraclass Variations,"Robotic detection of people in crowded and/or cluttered human-centered environments including hospitals, long-term care, stores and airports is challenging as people can become occluded by other people or objects, and deform due to variations in clothing or pose. There can also be loss of discriminative visual features due to poor lighting. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal person detection architecture to address the mobile robot problem of person detection under intraclass variations. We present a two-stage training approach using 1) a unique pretraining method we define as Temporal Invariant Multimodal Contrastive Learning (TimCLR), and 2) a Multimodal Faster R-CNN (MFRCNN) detector. TimCLR learns person representations that are invariant under intraclass variations through unsupervised learning. Our approach is unique in that it generates image pairs from natural variations within multimodal image sequences, in addition to synthetic data augmentation, and contrasts crossmodal features to transfer invariances between different modalities. These pretrained features are used by the MFRCNN detector for finetuning and person detection from RGB-D images. Extensive experiments validate the performance of our DL architecture in both human-centered crowded and cluttered environments. Results show that our method outperforms existing unimodal and multimodal person detection approaches in terms of detection accuracy in detecting people with body occlusions and pose deformations in different lighting conditions."
2203.00387,Motion-aware Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Video Compressive Sensing,"Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) utilizes a 2D detector to capture sequential video frames and compress them into a single measurement. Various reconstruction methods have been developed to recover the high-speed video frames from the snapshot measurement. However, most existing reconstruction methods are incapable of efficiently capturing long-range spatial and temporal dependencies, which are critical for video processing. In this paper, we propose a flexible and robust approach based on the graph neural network (GNN) to efficiently model non-local interactions between pixels in space and time regardless of the distance. Specifically, we develop a motion-aware dynamic GNN for better video representation, i.e., represent each node as the aggregation of relative neighbors under the guidance of frame-by-frame motions, which consists of motion-aware dynamic sampling, cross-scale node sampling, global knowledge integration, and graph aggregation. Extensive results on both simulation and real data demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, and the visualization illustrates the intrinsic dynamic sampling operations of our proposed model for boosting the video SCI reconstruction results. The code and model will be released."
2203.00417,Beam-Shape Effects and Noise Removal from THz Time-Domain Images in   Reflection Geometry in the 0.25-6 THz Range,"The increasing need of restoring high-resolution Hyper-Spectral (HS) images is determining a growing reliance on Computer Vision-based processing to enhance the clarity of the image content. HS images can, in fact, suffer from degradation effects or artefacts caused by instrument limitations. This paper focuses on a procedure aimed at reducing the degradation effects, frequency-dependent blur and noise, in Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) images in reflection geometry. It describes the application of a joint deblurring and denoising approach that had been previously proved to be effective for the restoration of THz-TDS images in transmission geometry, but that had never been tested in reflection modality. This mode is often the only one that can be effectively used in most cases, for example when analyzing objects that are either opaque in the THz range, or that cannot be displaced from their location (e.g., museums), such as those of cultural interest. Compared to transmission mode, reflection geometry introduces, however, further distortion to THz data, neglected in existing literature. In this work, we successfully implement image deblurring and denoising of both uniform-shape samples (a contemporary 1 Euro cent coin and an inlaid pendant) and samples with the uneven reliefs and corrosion products on the surface which make the analysis of the object particularly complex (an ancient Roman silver coin). The study demonstrates the ability of image processing to restore data in the 0.25 - 6 THz range, spanning over more than four octaves, and providing the foundation for future analytical approaches of cultural heritage using the far-infrared spectrum still not sufficiently investigated in literature."
2203.00570,Towards a unified view of unsupervised non-local methods for image   denoising: the NL-Ridge approach,"We propose a unified view of unsupervised non-local methods for image denoising that linearily combine noisy image patches. The best methods, established in different modeling and estimation frameworks, are two-step algorithms. Leveraging Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) for the first step and the ""internal adaptation"", a concept borrowed from deep learning theory, for the second one, we show that our NL-Ridge approach enables to reconcile several patch aggregation methods for image denoising. In the second step, our closed-form aggregation weights are computed through multivariate Ridge regressions. Experiments on artificially noisy images demonstrate that NL-Ridge may outperform well established state-of-the-art unsupervised denoisers such as BM3D and NL-Bayes, as well as recent unsupervised deep learning methods, while being simpler conceptually."
2203.00833,Adaptive Discriminative Regularization for Visual Classification,"How to improve discriminative feature learning is central in classification. Existing works address this problem by explicitly increasing inter-class separability and intra-class similarity, whether by constructing positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning or posing tighter class separating margins. These methods do not exploit the similarity between different classes as they adhere to i.i.d. assumption in data. In this paper, we embrace the real-world data distribution setting that some classes share semantic overlaps due to their similar appearances or concepts. Regarding this hypothesis, we propose a novel regularization to improve discriminative learning. We first calibrate the estimated highest likelihood of one sample based on its semantically neighboring classes, then encourage the overall likelihood predictions to be deterministic by imposing an adaptive exponential penalty. As the gradient of the proposed method is roughly proportional to the uncertainty of the predicted likelihoods, we name it adaptive discriminative regularization (ADR), trained along with a standard cross entropy loss in classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can yield consistent and non-trivial performance improvements in a variety of visual classification tasks (over 10 benchmarks). Furthermore, we find it is robust to long-tailed and noisy label data distribution. Its flexible design enables its compatibility with mainstream classification architectures and losses."
2203.01207,Container Localisation and Mass Estimation with an RGB-D Camera,"In the research area of human-robot interactions, the automatic estimation of the mass of a container manipulated by a person leveraging only visual information is a challenging task. The main challenges consist of occlusions, different filling materials and lighting conditions. The mass of an object constitutes key information for the robot to correctly regulate the force required to grasp the container. We propose a single RGB-D camera-based method to locate a manipulated container and estimate its empty mass i.e., independently of the presence of the content. The method first automatically selects a number of candidate containers based on the distance with the fixed frontal view, then averages the mass predictions of a lightweight model to provide the final estimation. Results on the CORSMAL Containers Manipulation dataset show that the proposed method estimates empty container mass obtaining a score of 71.08% under different lighting or filling conditions."
2203.01231,Differentiable Iterated Function Systems,This preliminary paper presents initial explorations in rendering Iterated Function System (IFS) fractals using a differentiable rendering pipeline. Differentiable rendering is a recent innovation at the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning. A fractal rendering pipeline composed of differentiable operations opens up many possibilities for generating fractals that meet particular criteria. In this paper I demonstrate this pipeline by generating IFS fractals with fixed points that resemble a given target image - a famous problem known as the \emph{inverse IFS problem}. The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) I demonstrate (and make code available) this rendering pipeline; 2) I discuss some of the nuances and pitfalls in gradient-descent-based optimization over fractal structures; 3) I discuss best practices to address some of these pitfalls; and finally 4) I discuss directions for further experiments to validate the technique.
2203.01289,ADVISE: ADaptive Feature Relevance and VISual Explanations for   Convolutional Neural Networks,"To equip Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with explainability, it is essential to interpret how opaque models take specific decisions, understand what causes the errors, improve the architecture design, and identify unethical biases in the classifiers. This paper introduces ADVISE, a new explainability method that quantifies and leverages the relevance of each unit of the feature map to provide better visual explanations. To this end, we propose using adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation to assign a relevance score to each unit of the feature map with respect to the predicted class. We also propose an evaluation protocol to quantitatively assess the visual explainability of CNN models. We extensively evaluate our idea in the image classification task using AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception pretrained on ImageNet. We compare ADVISE with the state-of-the-art visual explainable methods and show that the proposed method outperforms competing approaches in quantifying feature-relevance and visual explainability while maintaining competitive time complexity. Our experiments further show that ADVISE fulfils the sensitivity and implementation independence axioms while passing the sanity checks. The implementation is accessible for reproducibility purposes on https://github.com/dehshibi/ADVISE."
2203.01327,Hyperspectral Pixel Unmixing with Latent Dirichlet Variational   Autoencoder,"We present a method for hyperspectral pixel {\it unmixing}. The proposed method assumes that (1) {\it abundances} can be encoded as Dirichlet distributions and (2) spectra of {\it endmembers} can be represented as multivariate Normal distributions. The method solves the problem of abundance estimation and endmember extraction within a variational autoencoder setting where a Dirichlet bottleneck layer models the abundances, and the decoder performs endmember extraction. The proposed method can also leverage transfer learning paradigm, where the model is only trained on synthetic data containing pixels that are linear combinations of one or more endmembers of interest. In this case, we retrieve endmembers (spectra) from the United States Geological Survey Spectral Library. The model thus trained can be subsequently used to perform pixel unmixing on ""real data"" that contains a subset of the endmembers used to generated the synthetic data. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks: Cuprite, Urban Hydice and Samson. We also present new synthetic dataset, OnTech-HSI-Syn-21, that can be used to study hyperspectral pixel unmixing methods. We showcase the transfer learning capabilities of the proposed model on Cuprite and OnTech-HSI-Syn-21 datasets. In summary, the proposed method can be applied for pixel unmixing a variety of domains, including agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, analysis of materials, healthcare, etc. Additionally, the proposed method eschews the need for labelled data for training by leveraging the transfer learning paradigm, where the model is trained on synthetic data generated using the endmembers present in the ""real"" data."
2203.01577,HOI4D: A 4D Egocentric Dataset for Category-Level Human-Object   Interaction,"We present HOI4D, a large-scale 4D egocentric dataset with rich annotations, to catalyze the research of category-level human-object interaction. HOI4D consists of 2.4M RGB-D egocentric video frames over 4000 sequences collected by 4 participants interacting with 800 different object instances from 16 categories over 610 different indoor rooms. Frame-wise annotations for panoptic segmentation, motion segmentation, 3D hand pose, category-level object pose and hand action have also been provided, together with reconstructed object meshes and scene point clouds. With HOI4D, we establish three benchmarking tasks to promote category-level HOI from 4D visual signals including semantic segmentation of 4D dynamic point cloud sequences, category-level object pose tracking, and egocentric action segmentation with diverse interaction targets. In-depth analysis shows HOI4D poses great challenges to existing methods and produces great research opportunities."
2203.01587,Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer for Efficient Inference,"Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved promising performance in image recognition and gradually serves as a powerful backbone in various vision tasks. To satisfy the sequential input of Transformer, the tail of ViT first splits each image into a sequence of visual tokens with a fixed length. Then the following self-attention layers constructs the global relationship between tokens to produce useful representation for the downstream tasks. Empirically, representing the image with more tokens leads to better performance, yet the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention layer to the number of tokens could seriously influence the efficiency of ViT's inference. For computational reduction, a few pruning methods progressively prune uninformative tokens in the Transformer encoder, while leaving the number of tokens before the Transformer untouched. In fact, fewer tokens as the input for the Transformer encoder can directly reduce the following computational cost. In this spirit, we propose a Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer (MT-ViT) in the paper. MT-ViT adopts multiple tails to produce visual sequences of different lengths for the following Transformer encoder. A tail predictor is introduced to decide which tail is the most efficient for the image to produce accurate prediction. Both modules are optimized in an end-to-end fashion, with the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that MT-ViT can achieve a significant reduction on FLOPs with no degradation of the accuracy and outperform other compared methods in both accuracy and FLOPs."
2203.01923,Recovering 3D Human Mesh from Monocular Images: A Survey,"Estimating human pose and shape from monocular images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Since the release of statistical body models, 3D human mesh recovery has been drawing broader attention. With the same goal of obtaining well-aligned and physically plausible mesh results, two paradigms have been developed to overcome challenges in the 2D-to-3D lifting process: i) an optimization-based paradigm, where different data terms and regularization terms are exploited as optimization objectives; and ii) a regression-based paradigm, where deep learning techniques are embraced to solve the problem in an end-to-end fashion. Meanwhile, continuous efforts are devoted to improving the quality of 3D mesh labels for a wide range of datasets. Though remarkable progress has been achieved in the past decade, the task is still challenging due to flexible body motions, diverse appearances, complex environments, and insufficient in-the-wild annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that focuses on the task of monocular 3D human mesh recovery. We start with the introduction of body models and then elaborate recovery frameworks and training objectives by providing in-depth analyses of their strengths and weaknesses. We also summarize datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmark results. Open issues and future directions are discussed in the end, hoping to motivate researchers and facilitate their research in this area. A regularly updated project page can be found at https://github.com/tinatiansjz/hmr-survey."
2203.02069,Sim2Real Instance-Level Style Transfer for 6D Pose Estimation,"In recent years, synthetic data has been widely used in the training of 6D pose estimation networks, in part because it automatically provides perfect annotation at low cost. However, there are still non-trivial domain gaps, such as differences in textures/materials, between synthetic and real data. These gaps have a measurable impact on performance. To solve this problem, we introduce a simulation to reality (sim2real) instance-level style transfer for 6D pose estimation network training. Our approach transfers the style of target objects individually, from synthetic to real, without human intervention. This improves the quality of synthetic data for training pose estimation networks. We also propose a complete pipeline from data collection to the training of a pose estimation network and conduct extensive evaluation on a real-world robotic platform. Our evaluation shows significant improvement achieved by our method in both pose estimation performance and the realism of images adapted by the style transfer."
2203.02115,Towards Benchmarking and Evaluating Deepfake Detection,"Deepfake detection automatically recognizes the manipulated medias through the analysis of the difference between manipulated and non-altered videos. It is natural to ask which are the top performers among the existing deepfake detection approaches to identify promising research directions and provide practical guidance. Unfortunately, it's difficult to conduct a sound benchmarking comparison of existing detection approaches using the results in the literature because evaluation conditions are inconsistent across studies. Our objective is to establish a comprehensive and consistent benchmark, to develop a repeatable evaluation procedure, and to measure the performance of a range of detection approaches so that the results can be compared soundly. A challenging dataset consisting of the manipulated samples generated by more than 13 different methods has been collected, and 11 popular detection approaches (9 algorithms) from the existing literature have been implemented and evaluated with 6 fair-minded and practical evaluation metrics. Finally, 92 models have been trained and 644 experiments have been performed for the evaluation. The results along with the shared data and evaluation methodology constitute a benchmark for comparing deepfake detection approaches and measuring progress."
2203.02158,Transformations in Learned Image Compression from a Modulation   Perspective,"In this paper, a unified transformation method in learned image compression(LIC) is proposed from the perspective of modulation. Firstly, the quantization in LIC is considered as a generalized channel with additive uniform noise. Moreover, the LIC is interpreted as a particular communication system according to the consistency in structures and optimization objectives. Thus, the technology of communication systems can be applied to guide the design of modules in LIC. Furthermore, a unified transform method based on signal modulation (TSM) is defined. In the view of TSM, the existing transformation methods are mathematically reduced to a linear modulation. A series of transformation methods, e.g. TPM and TJM, are obtained by extending to nonlinear modulation. The experimental results on various datasets and backbone architectures verify that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. More importantly, it further confirms the feasibility of guiding LIC design from a communication perspective. For example, when backbone architecture is hyperprior combining context model, our method achieves 3.52$\%$ BD-rate reduction over GDN on Kodak dataset without increasing complexity."
2203.02452,Contextformer: A Transformer with Spatio-Channel Attention for Context   Modeling in Learned Image Compression,"Entropy modeling is a key component for high-performance image compression algorithms. Recent developments in autoregressive context modeling helped learning-based methods to surpass their classical counterparts. However, the performance of those models can be further improved due to the underexploited spatio-channel dependencies in latent space, and the suboptimal implementation of context adaptivity. Inspired by the adaptive characteristics of the transformers, we propose a transformer-based context model, named Contextformer, which generalizes the de facto standard attention mechanism to spatio-channel attention. We replace the context model of a modern compression framework with the Contextformer and test it on the widely used Kodak, CLIC2020, and Tecnick image datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed model provides up to 11% rate savings compared to the standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Test Model (VTM) 16.2, and outperforms various learning-based models in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM."
2203.02690,$\ell_1$DecNet+: A new architecture framework by $\ell_1$ decomposition   and iteration unfolding for sparse feature segmentation,"$\ell_1$ based sparse regularization plays a central role in compressive sensing and image processing. In this paper, we propose $\ell_1$DecNet, as an unfolded network derived from a variational decomposition model incorporating $\ell_1$ related sparse regularization and solved by scaled alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). $\ell_1$DecNet effectively decomposes an input image into a sparse feature and a learned dense feature, and thus helps the subsequent sparse feature related operations. Based on this, we develop $\ell_1$DecNet+, a learnable architecture framework consisting of our $\ell_1$DecNet and a segmentation module which operates over extracted sparse features instead of original images. This architecture combines well the benefits of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate mathematical image prior into feature extraction in segmentation network structures. Moreover, our $\ell_1$DecNet+ framework can be easily extended to 3D case. We evaluate the effectiveness of $\ell_1$DecNet+ on two commonly encountered sparse segmentation tasks: retinal vessel segmentation in medical image processing and pavement crack detection in industrial abnormality identification. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that, our $\ell_1$DecNet+ architecture with various lightweight segmentation modules can achieve equal or better performance than their enlarged versions respectively. This leads to especially practical advantages on resource-limited devices."
2203.03187,Knowledge Amalgamation for Object Detection with Transformers,"Knowledge amalgamation (KA) is a novel deep model reusing task aiming to transfer knowledge from several well-trained teachers to a multi-talented and compact student. Currently, most of these approaches are tailored for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there is a tendency that transformers, with a completely different architecture, are starting to challenge the domination of CNNs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, directly applying the previous KA methods to transformers leads to severe performance degradation. In this work, we explore a more effective KA scheme for transformer-based object detection models. Specifically, considering the architecture characteristics of transformers, we propose to dissolve the KA into two aspects: sequence-level amalgamation (SA) and task-level amalgamation (TA). In particular, a hint is generated within the sequence-level amalgamation by concatenating teacher sequences instead of redundantly aggregating them to a fixed-size one as previous KA works. Besides, the student learns heterogeneous detection tasks through soft targets with efficiency in the task-level amalgamation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO have unfolded that the sequence-level amalgamation significantly boosts the performance of students, while the previous methods impair the students. Moreover, the transformer-based students excel in learning amalgamated knowledge, as they have mastered heterogeneous detection tasks rapidly and achieved superior or at least comparable performance to those of the teachers in their specializations."
2203.03415,Keep It Accurate and Robust: An Enhanced Nuclei Analysis Framework,"Accurate segmentation and classification of nuclei in histology images is critical but challenging due to nuclei heterogeneity, staining variations, and tissue complexity. Existing methods often struggle with limited dataset variability, with patches extracted from similar whole slide images (WSI), making models prone to falling into local optima. Here we propose a new framework to address this limitation and enable robust nuclear analysis. Our method leverages dual-level ensemble modeling to overcome issues stemming from limited dataset variation. Intra-ensembling applies diverse transformations to individual samples, while inter-ensembling combines networks of different scales. We also introduce enhancements to the HoVer-Net architecture, including updated encoders, nested dense decoding and model regularization strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, including 1st place for nuclear composition prediction and 3rd place for segmentation/classification in the 2022 Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) Challenge. This success validates our approach for accurate histological nuclei analysis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies provide insights into optimal network design choices and training techniques. In conclusion, this work proposes an improved framework advancing the state-of-the-art in nuclei analysis. We release our code and models (https://github.com/WinnieLaugh/CONIC_Pathology_AI) to serve as a toolkit for the community."
2203.04049,Graph Attention Transformer Network for Multi-Label Image Classification,"Multi-label classification aims to recognize multiple objects or attributes from images. However, it is challenging to learn from proper label graphs to effectively characterize such inter-label correlations or dependencies. Current methods often use the co-occurrence probability of labels based on the training set as the adjacency matrix to model this correlation, which is greatly limited by the dataset and affects the model's generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Graph Attention Transformer Network (GATN), a general framework for multi-label image classification that can effectively mine complex inter-label relationships. First, we use the cosine similarity based on the label word embedding as the initial correlation matrix, which can represent rich semantic information. Subsequently, we design the graph attention transformer layer to transfer this adjacency matrix to adapt to the current domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three datasets."
2203.04290,Residual Aligner Network,"Image registration is important for medical imaging, the estimation of the spatial transformation between different images. Many previous studies have used learning-based methods for coarse-to-fine registration to efficiently perform 3D image registration. The coarse-to-fine approach, however, is limited when dealing with the different motions of nearby objects. Here we propose a novel Motion-Aware (MA) structure that captures the different motions in a region. The MA structure incorporates a novel Residual Aligner (RA) module which predicts the multi-head displacement field used to disentangle the different motions of multiple neighbouring objects. Compared with other deep learning methods, the network based on the MA structure and RA module achieve one of the most accurate unsupervised inter-subject registration on the 9 organs of assorted sizes in abdominal CT scans, with the highest-ranked registration of the veins (Dice Similarity Coefficient / Average surface distance: 62\%/4.9mm for the vena cava and 34\%/7.9mm for the portal and splenic vein), with a half-sized structure and more efficient computation. Applied to the segmentation of lungs in chest CT scans, the new network achieves results which were indistinguishable from the best-ranked networks (94\%/3.0mm). Additionally, the theorem on predicted motion pattern and the design of MA structure are validated by further analysis."
2203.04412,ImageNet-Patch: A Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Robustness   against Adversarial Patches,"Adversarial patches are optimized contiguous pixel blocks in an input image that cause a machine-learning model to misclassify it. However, their optimization is computationally demanding, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to suboptimal robustness evaluations. To overcome these issues, we propose ImageNet-Patch, a dataset to benchmark machine-learning models against adversarial patches. It consists of a set of patches, optimized to generalize across different models, and readily applicable to ImageNet data after preprocessing them with affine transformations. This process enables an approximate yet faster robustness evaluation, leveraging the transferability of adversarial perturbations. We showcase the usefulness of this dataset by testing the effectiveness of the computed patches against 127 models. We conclude by discussing how our dataset could be used as a benchmark for robustness, and how our methodology can be generalized to other domains. We open source our dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/ImageNet-Patch."
2203.04456,Probabilistic Rotation Representation With an Efficiently Computable   Bingham Loss Function and Its Application to Pose Estimation,"In recent years, a deep learning framework has been widely used for object pose estimation. While quaternion is a common choice for rotation representation of 6D pose, it cannot represent an uncertainty of the observation. In order to handle the uncertainty, Bingham distribution is one promising solution because this has suitable features, such as a smooth representation over SO(3), in addition to the ambiguity representation. However, it requires the complex computation of the normalizing constants. This is the bottleneck of loss computation in training neural networks based on Bingham representation. As such, we propose a fast-computable and easy-to-implement loss function for Bingham distribution. We also show not only to examine the parametrization of Bingham distribution but also an application based on our loss function."
2203.04560,Active Self-Semi-Supervised Learning for Few Labeled Samples,"Training deep models with limited annotations poses a significant challenge when applied to diverse practical domains. Employing semi-supervised learning alongside the self-supervised model offers the potential to enhance label efficiency. However, this approach faces a bottleneck in reducing the need for labels. We observed that the semi-supervised model disrupts valuable information from self-supervised learning when only limited labels are available. To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, active self-semi-supervised learning (AS3L). AS3L bootstraps semi-supervised models with prior pseudo-labels (PPL). These PPLs are obtained by label propagation over self-supervised features. Based on the observations the accuracy of PPL is not only affected by the quality of features but also by the selection of the labeled samples. We develop active learning and label propagation strategies to obtain accurate PPL. Consequently, our framework can significantly improve the performance of models in the case of limited annotations while demonstrating fast convergence. On the image classification tasks across four datasets, our method outperforms the baseline by an average of 5.4\%. Additionally, it achieves the same accuracy as the baseline method in about 1/3 of the training time."
2203.04607,Practical No-box Adversarial Attacks with Training-free Hybrid Image   Transformation,"In recent years, the adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has raised increasing attention. Among all the threat models, no-box attacks are the most practical but extremely challenging since they neither rely on any knowledge of the target model or similar substitute model, nor access the dataset for training a new substitute model. Although a recent method has attempted such an attack in a loose sense, its performance is not good enough and computational overhead of training is expensive. In this paper, we move a step forward and show the existence of a \textbf{training-free} adversarial perturbation under the no-box threat model, which can be successfully used to attack different DNNs in real-time. Motivated by our observation that high-frequency component (HFC) domains in low-level features and plays a crucial role in classification, we attack an image mainly by manipulating its frequency components. Specifically, the perturbation is manipulated by suppression of the original HFC and adding of noisy HFC. We empirically and experimentally analyze the requirements of effective noisy HFC and show that it should be regionally homogeneous, repeating and dense. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed no-box method. It attacks ten well-known models with a success rate of \textbf{98.13\%} on average, which outperforms state-of-the-art no-box attacks by \textbf{29.39\%}. Furthermore, our method is even competitive to mainstream transfer-based black-box attacks."
2203.04962,Learning the Degradation Distribution for Blind Image Super-Resolution,"Synthetic high-resolution (HR) \& low-resolution (LR) pairs are widely used in existing super-resolution (SR) methods. To avoid the domain gap between synthetic and test images, most previous methods try to adaptively learn the synthesizing (degrading) process via a deterministic model. However, some degradations in real scenarios are stochastic and cannot be determined by the content of the image. These deterministic models may fail to model the random factors and content-independent parts of degradations, which will limit the performance of the following SR models. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic degradation model (PDM), which studies the degradation $\mathbf{D}$ as a random variable, and learns its distribution by modeling the mapping from a priori random variable $\mathbf{z}$ to $\mathbf{D}$. Compared with previous deterministic degradation models, PDM could model more diverse degradations and generate HR-LR pairs that may better cover the various degradations of test images, and thus prevent the SR model from over-fitting to specific ones. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our degradation model can help the SR model achieve better performance on different datasets. The source codes are released at \url{git@github.com:greatlog/UnpairedSR.git}."
2203.05103,Improving Neural ODEs via Knowledge Distillation,"Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) construct the continuous dynamics of hidden units using ordinary differential equations specified by a neural network, demonstrating promising results on many tasks. However, Neural ODEs still do not perform well on image recognition tasks. The possible reason is that the one-hot encoding vector commonly used in Neural ODEs can not provide enough supervised information. We propose a new training based on knowledge distillation to construct more powerful and robust Neural ODEs fitting image recognition tasks. Specially, we model the training of Neural ODEs into a teacher-student learning process, in which we propose ResNets as the teacher model to provide richer supervised information. The experimental results show that the new training manner can improve the classification accuracy of Neural ODEs by 24% on CIFAR10 and 5% on SVHN. In addition, we also quantitatively discuss the effect of both knowledge distillation and time horizon in Neural ODEs on robustness against adversarial examples. The experimental analysis concludes that introducing the knowledge distillation and increasing the time horizon can improve the robustness of Neural ODEs against adversarial examples."
2203.05294,Domain Generalisation for Object Detection under Covariate and Concept   Shift,"Domain generalisation aims to promote the learning of domain-invariant features while suppressing domain-specific features, so that a model can generalise better to previously unseen target domains. An approach to domain generalisation for object detection is proposed, the first such approach applicable to any object detection architecture. Based on a rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend approaches based on feature alignment with a novel component for performing class conditional alignment at the instance level, in addition to aligning the marginal feature distributions across domains at the image level. This allows us to fully address both components of domain shift, i.e. covariate and concept shift, and learn a domain agnostic feature representation. We perform extensive evaluation with both one-stage (FCOS, YOLO) and two-stage (FRCNN) detectors, on a newly proposed benchmark comprising several different datasets for autonomous driving applications (Cityscapes, BDD10K, ACDC, IDD) as well as the GWHD dataset for precision agriculture, and show consistent improvements to the generalisation and localisation performance over baselines and state-of-the-art."
2203.06096,WLASL-LEX: a Dataset for Recognising Phonological Properties in American   Sign Language,"Signed Language Processing (SLP) concerns the automated processing of signed languages, the main means of communication of Deaf and hearing impaired individuals. SLP features many different tasks, ranging from sign recognition to translation and production of signed speech, but has been overlooked by the NLP community thus far. In this paper, we bring to attention the task of modelling the phonology of sign languages. We leverage existing resources to construct a large-scale dataset of American Sign Language signs annotated with six different phonological properties. We then conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether data-driven end-to-end and feature-based approaches can be optimised to automatically recognise these properties. We find that, despite the inherent challenges of the task, graph-based neural networks that operate over skeleton features extracted from raw videos are able to succeed at the task to a varying degree. Most importantly, we show that this performance pertains even on signs unobserved during training."
2203.06424,VariabilityTrack:Multi-Object Tracking with Variable Speed Object   Movement,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims at estimating bounding boxes and identities of objects in videos. Most methods can be roughly classified as tracking-by-detection and joint-detection-association paradigms. Although the latter has elicited more attention and demonstrates comparable performance relative than the former, we claim that the tracking-by-detection paradigm is still the optimal solution in terms of tracking accuracy,such as ByteTrack,which achieves 80.3 MOTA, 77.3 IDF1 and 63.1 HOTA on the test set of MOT17 with 30 FPS running speed on a single V100 GPU.However, under complex perspectives such as vehicle and UAV acceleration, the performance of such a tracker using uniform Kalman filter will be greatly affected, resulting in tracking loss.In this paper, we propose a variable speed Kalman filter algorithm based on environmental feedback and improve the matching process, which can greatly improve the tracking effect in complex variable speed scenes while maintaining high tracking accuracy in relatively static scenes. Eventually, higher MOTA and IDF1 results can be achieved on MOT17 test set than ByteTrack"
2203.06431,Deep learning-based conditional inpainting for restoration of   artifact-affected 4D CT images,"4D CT imaging is an essential component of radiotherapy of thoracic/abdominal tumors. 4D CT images are, however, often affected by artifacts that compromise treatment planning quality. In this work, deep learning (DL)-based conditional inpainting is proposed to restore anatomically correct image information of artifact-affected areas. The restoration approach consists of a two-stage process: DL-based detection of common interpolation (INT) and double structure (DS) artifacts, followed by conditional inpainting applied to the artifact areas. In this context, conditional refers to a guidance of the inpainting process by patient-specific image data to ensure anatomically reliable results. The study is based on 65 in-house 4D CT images of lung cancer patients (48 with only slight artifacts, 17 with pronounced artifacts) and two publicly available 4D CT data sets that serve as independent external test sets. Automated artifact detection revealed a ROC-AUC of 0.99 for INT and of 0.97 for DS artifacts (in-house data). The proposed inpainting method decreased the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 52%(INT) and 59% (DS) for the in-house data. For the external test data sets, the RMSE improvement is similar (50% and 59 %, respectively). Applied to 4D CT data with pronounced artifacts (not part of the training set), 72% of the detectable artifacts were removed. The results highlight the potential of DL-based inpainting for restoration of artifact-affected 4D CT data. Compared to recent 4D CT inpainting and restoration approaches, the proposed methodology illustrates the advantages of exploiting patient-specific prior image information."
2203.06663,Global2Local: A Joint-Hierarchical Attention for Video Captioning,"Recently, automatic video captioning has attracted increasing attention, where the core challenge lies in capturing the key semantic items, like objects and actions as well as their spatial-temporal correlations from the redundant frames and semantic content. To this end, existing works select either the key video clips in a global level~(across multi frames), or key regions within each frame, which, however, neglect the hierarchical order, i.e., key frames first and key regions latter. In this paper, we propose a novel joint-hierarchical attention model for video captioning, which embeds the key clips, the key frames and the key regions jointly into the captioning model in a hierarchical manner. Such a joint-hierarchical attention model first conducts a global selection to identify key frames, followed by a Gumbel sampling operation to identify further key regions based on the key frames, achieving an accurate global-to-local feature representation to guide the captioning. Extensive quantitative evaluations on two public benchmark datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods."
2203.06667,Towards Visual-Prompt Temporal Answering Grounding in Medical   Instructional Video,"The temporal answering grounding in the video (TAGV) is a new task naturally derived from temporal sentence grounding in the video (TSGV). Given an untrimmed video and a text question, this task aims at locating the matching span from the video that can semantically answer the question. Existing methods tend to formulate the TAGV task with a visual span-based question answering (QA) approach by matching the visual frame span queried by the text question. However, due to the weak correlations and huge gaps of the semantic features between the textual question and visual answer, existing methods adopting visual span predictor perform poorly in the TAGV task. To bridge these gaps, we propose a visual-prompt text span localizing (VPTSL) method, which introduces the timestamped subtitles as a passage to perform the text span localization for the input text question, and prompts the visual highlight features into the pre-trained language model (PLM) for enhancing the joint semantic representations. Specifically, the context query attention is utilized to perform cross-modal interaction between the extracted textual and visual features. Then, the highlight features are obtained through the video-text highlighting for the visual prompt. To alleviate semantic differences between textual and visual features, we design the text span predictor by encoding the question, the subtitles, and the prompted visual highlight features with the PLM. As a result, the TAGV task is formulated to predict the span of subtitles matching the visual answer. Extensive experiments on the medical instructional dataset, namely MedVidQA, show that the proposed VPTSL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 28.36% in terms of mIOU with a large margin, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed visual prompt and the text span predictor."
2203.07000,Cross-View-Prediction: Exploring Contrastive Feature for Hyperspectral   Image Classification,"This paper presents a self-supervised feature learning method for hyperspectral image classification. Our method tries to construct two different views of the raw hyperspectral image through a cross-representation learning method. And then to learn semantically consistent representation over the created views by contrastive learning method. Specifically, four cross-channel-prediction based augmentation methods are naturally designed to utilize the high dimension characteristic of hyperspectral data for the view construction. And the better representative features are learned by maximizing mutual information and minimizing conditional entropy across different views from our contrastive network. This 'Cross-View-Predicton' style is straightforward and gets the state-of-the-art performance of unsupervised classification with a simple SVM classifier."
2203.07436,SuperAnimal pretrained pose estimation models for behavioral analysis,"Quantification of behavior is critical in applications ranging from neuroscience, veterinary medicine and animal conservation efforts. A common key step for behavioral analysis is first extracting relevant keypoints on animals, known as pose estimation. However, reliable inference of poses currently requires domain knowledge and manual labeling effort to build supervised models. We present a series of technical innovations that enable a new method, collectively called SuperAnimal, to develop unified foundation models that can be used on over 45 species, without additional human labels. Concretely, we introduce a method to unify the keypoint space across differently labeled datasets (via our generalized data converter) and for training these diverse datasets in a manner such that they don't catastrophically forget keypoints given the unbalanced inputs (via our keypoint gradient masking and memory replay approaches). These models show excellent performance across six pose benchmarks. Then, to ensure maximal usability for end-users, we demonstrate how to fine-tune the models on differently labeled data and provide tooling for unsupervised video adaptation to boost performance and decrease jitter across frames. If the models are fine-tuned, we show SuperAnimal models are 10-100$\times$ more data efficient than prior transfer-learning-based approaches. We illustrate the utility of our models in behavioral classification in mice and gait analysis in horses. Collectively, this presents a data-efficient solution for animal pose estimation."
2203.07738,GCT: Graph Co-Training for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning,"Few-shot learning (FSL), purposing to resolve the problem of data-scarce, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. A popular FSL framework contains two phases: (i) the pre-train phase employs the base data to train a CNN-based feature extractor. (ii) the meta-test phase applies the frozen feature extractor to novel data (novel data has different categories from base data) and designs a classifier for recognition. To correct few-shot data distribution, researchers propose Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning (SSFSL) by introducing unlabeled data. Although SSFSL has been proved to achieve outstanding performances in the FSL community, there still exists a fundamental problem: the pre-trained feature extractor can not adapt to the novel data flawlessly due to the cross-category setting. Usually, large amounts of noises are introduced to the novel feature. We dub it as Feature-Extractor-Maladaptive (FEM) problem. To tackle FEM, we make two efforts in this paper. First, we propose a novel label prediction method, Isolated Graph Learning (IGL). IGL introduces the Laplacian operator to encode the raw data to graph space, which helps reduce the dependence on features when classifying, and then project graph representation to label space for prediction. The key point is that: IGL can weaken the negative influence of noise from the feature representation perspective, and is also flexible to independently complete training and testing procedures, which is suitable for SSFSL. Second, we propose Graph Co-Training (GCT) to tackle this challenge from a multi-modal fusion perspective by extending the proposed IGL to the co-training framework. GCT is a semi-supervised method that exploits the unlabeled samples with two modal features to crossly strengthen the IGL classifier."
2203.07792,Parking Analytics Framework using Deep Learning,"With the number of vehicles continuously increasing, parking monitoring and analysis are becoming a substantial feature of modern cities. In this study, we present a methodology to monitor car parking areas and to analyze their occupancy in real-time. The solution is based on a combination between image analysis and deep learning techniques. It incorporates four building blocks put inside a pipeline: vehicle detection, vehicle tracking, manual annotation of parking slots, and occupancy estimation using the Ray Tracing algorithm. The aim of this methodology is to optimize the use of parking areas and to reduce the time wasted by daily drivers to find the right parking slot for their cars. Also, it helps to better manage the space of the parking areas and to discover misuse cases. A demonstration of the provided solution is shown in the following video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbAt8zT14Tc."
2203.07976,On the Pitfalls of Batch Normalization for End-to-End Video Learning: A   Study on Surgical Workflow Analysis,"Batch Normalization's (BN) unique property of depending on other samples in a batch is known to cause problems in several tasks, including sequence modeling. Yet, BN-related issues are hardly studied for long video understanding, despite the ubiquitous use of BN in CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for feature extraction. Especially in surgical workflow analysis, where the lack of pretrained feature extractors has led to complex, multi-stage training pipelines, limited awareness of BN issues may have hidden the benefits of training CNNs and temporal models end to end. In this paper, we analyze pitfalls of BN in video learning, including issues specific to online tasks such as a 'cheating' effect in anticipation. We observe that BN's properties create major obstacles for end-to-end learning. However, using BN-free backbones, even simple CNN-LSTMs beat the state of the art {\color{\colorrevtwo}on three surgical workflow benchmarks} by utilizing adequate end-to-end training strategies which maximize temporal context. We conclude that awareness of BN's pitfalls is crucial for effective end-to-end learning in surgical tasks. By reproducing results on natural-video datasets, we hope our insights will benefit other areas of video learning as well. Code is available at: \url{https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/pitfalls_bn}"
2203.08147,Energy-Latency Attacks via Sponge Poisoning,"Sponge examples are test-time inputs optimized to increase energy consumption and prediction latency of deep networks deployed on hardware accelerators. By increasing the fraction of neurons activated during classification, these attacks reduce sparsity in network activation patterns, worsening the performance of hardware accelerators. In this work, we present a novel training-time attack, named sponge poisoning, which aims to worsen energy consumption and prediction latency of neural networks on any test input without affecting classification accuracy. To stage this attack, we assume that the attacker can control only a few model updates during training -- a likely scenario, e.g., when model training is outsourced to an untrusted third party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experiments on image classification tasks show that sponge poisoning is effective, and that fine-tuning poisoned models to repair them poses prohibitive costs for most users, highlighting that tackling sponge poisoning remains an open issue."
2203.08392,Patch-Fool: Are Vision Transformers Always Robust Against Adversarial   Perturbations?,"Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently set off a new wave in neural architecture design thanks to their record-breaking performance in various vision tasks. In parallel, to fulfill the goal of deploying ViTs into real-world vision applications, their robustness against potential malicious attacks has gained increasing attention. In particular, recent works show that ViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks as compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and conjecture that this is because ViTs focus more on capturing global interactions among different input/feature patches, leading to their improved robustness to local perturbations imposed by adversarial attacks. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: ""Under what kinds of perturbations do ViTs become more vulnerable learners compared to CNNs?"" Driven by this question, we first conduct a comprehensive experiment regarding the robustness of both ViTs and CNNs under various existing adversarial attacks to understand the underlying reason favoring their robustness. Based on the drawn insights, we then propose a dedicated attack framework, dubbed Patch-Fool, that fools the self-attention mechanism by attacking its basic component (i.e., a single patch) with a series of attention-aware optimization techniques. Interestingly, our Patch-Fool framework shows for the first time that ViTs are not necessarily more robust than CNNs against adversarial perturbations. In particular, we find that ViTs are more vulnerable learners compared with CNNs against our Patch-Fool attack which is consistent across extensive experiments, and the observations from Sparse/Mild Patch-Fool, two variants of Patch-Fool, indicate an intriguing insight that the perturbation density and strength on each patch seem to be the key factors that influence the robustness ranking between ViTs and CNNs."
2203.08612,CtlGAN: Few-shot Artistic Portraits Generation with Contrastive Transfer   Learning,"Generating artistic portraits is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing portrait stylization models that generate good quality results are based on Image-to-Image Translation and require abundant data from both source and target domains. However, without enough data, these methods would result in overfitting. In this work, we propose CtlGAN, a new few-shot artistic portraits generation model with a novel contrastive transfer learning strategy. We adapt a pretrained StyleGAN in the source domain to a target artistic domain with no more than 10 artistic faces. To reduce overfitting to the few training examples, we introduce a novel Cross-Domain Triplet loss which explicitly encourages the target instances generated from different latent codes to be distinguishable. We propose a new encoder which embeds real faces into Z+ space and proposes a dual-path training strategy to better cope with the adapted decoder and eliminate the artifacts. Extensive qualitative, quantitative comparisons and a user study show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts under 10-shot and 1-shot settings and generates high quality artistic portraits. The code will be made publicly available."
2203.08717,Weak Augmentation Guided Relational Self-Supervised Learning,"Self-supervised Learning (SSL) including the mainstream contrastive learning has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data annotations. However, most methods mainly focus on the instance level information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the feature embeddings of different augmentations. To boost the performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency. The designed asymmetric predictor head and an InfoNCE warm-up strategy enhance the robustness to hyper-parameters and benefit the resulting performance. Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across different network architectures, including various lightweight networks (\eg, EfficientNet and MobileNet)."
2203.08875,SC2 Benchmark: Supervised Compression for Split Computing,"With the increasing demand for deep learning models on mobile devices, splitting neural network computation between the device and a more powerful edge server has become an attractive solution. However, existing split computing approaches often underperform compared to a naive baseline of remote computation on compressed data. Recent studies propose learning compressed representations that contain more relevant information for supervised downstream tasks, showing improved tradeoffs between compressed data size and supervised performance. However, existing evaluation metrics only provide an incomplete picture of split computing. This study introduces supervised compression for split computing (SC2) and proposes new evaluation criteria: minimizing computation on the mobile device, minimizing transmitted data size, and maximizing model accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark study using 10 baseline methods, three computer vision tasks, and over 180 trained models, and discuss various aspects of SC2. We also release sc2bench, a Python package for future research on SC2. Our proposed metrics and package will help researchers better understand the tradeoffs of supervised compression in split computing."
2203.08964,Point-Unet: A Context-aware Point-based Neural Network for Volumetric   Segmentation,"Medical image analysis using deep learning has recently been prevalent, showing great performance for various downstream tasks including medical image segmentation and its sibling, volumetric image segmentation. Particularly, a typical volumetric segmentation network strongly relies on a voxel grid representation which treats volumetric data as a stack of individual voxel `slices', which allows learning to segment a voxel grid to be as straightforward as extending existing image-based segmentation networks to the 3D domain. However, using a voxel grid representation requires a large memory footprint, expensive test-time and limiting the scalability of the solutions. In this paper, we propose Point-Unet, a novel method that incorporates the efficiency of deep learning with 3D point clouds into volumetric segmentation. Our key idea is to first predict the regions of interest in the volume by learning an attentional probability map, which is then used for sampling the volume into a sparse point cloud that is subsequently segmented using a point-based neural network. We have conducted the experiments on the medical volumetric segmentation task with both a small-scale dataset Pancreas and large-scale datasets BraTS18, BraTS19, and BraTS20 challenges. A comprehensive benchmark on different metrics has shown that our context-aware Point-Unet robustly outperforms the SOTA voxel-based networks at both accuracies, memory usage during training, and time consumption during testing. Our code is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/Point-Unet."
2203.09679,Modeling Intensification for Sign Language Generation: A Computational   Approach,"End-to-end sign language generation models do not accurately represent the prosody in sign language. A lack of temporal and spatial variations leads to poor-quality generated presentations that confuse human interpreters. In this paper, we aim to improve the prosody in generated sign languages by modeling intensification in a data-driven manner. We present different strategies grounded in linguistics of sign language that inform how intensity modifiers can be represented in gloss annotations. To employ our strategies, we first annotate a subset of the benchmark PHOENIX-14T, a German Sign Language dataset, with different levels of intensification. We then use a supervised intensity tagger to extend the annotated dataset and obtain labels for the remaining portion of it. This enhanced dataset is then used to train state-of-the-art transformer models for sign language generation. We find that our efforts in intensification modeling yield better results when evaluated with automatic metrics. Human evaluation also indicates a higher preference of the videos generated using our model."
2203.09749,Goal-conditioned dual-action imitation learning for dexterous dual-arm robot manipulation,"Long-horizon dexterous robot manipulation of deformable objects, such as banana peeling, is a problematic task because of the difficulties in object modeling and a lack of knowledge about stable and dexterous manipulation skills. This paper presents a goal-conditioned dual-action (GC-DA) deep imitation learning (DIL) approach that can learn dexterous manipulation skills using human demonstration data. Previous DIL methods map the current sensory input and reactive action, which often fails because of compounding errors in imitation learning caused by the recurrent computation of actions. The method predicts reactive action only when the precise manipulation of the target object is required (local action) and generates the entire trajectory when precise manipulation is not required (global action). This dual-action formulation effectively prevents compounding error in the imitation learning using the trajectory-based global action while responding to unexpected changes in the target object during the reactive local action. The proposed method was tested in a real dual-arm robot and successfully accomplished the banana-peeling task. Data from this and related works are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/multi-task-fine."
2203.09773,Local-Global Context Aware Transformer for Language-Guided Video   Segmentation,"We explore the task of language-guided video segmentation (LVS). Previous algorithms mostly adopt 3D CNNs to learn video representation, struggling to capture long-term context and easily suffering from visual-linguistic misalignment. In light of this, we present Locater (local-global context aware Transformer), which augments the Transformer architecture with a finite memory so as to query the entire video with the language expression in an efficient manner. The memory is designed to involve two components -- one for persistently preserving global video content, and one for dynamically gathering local temporal context and segmentation history. Based on the memorized local-global context and the particular content of each frame, Locater holistically and flexibly comprehends the expression as an adaptive query vector for each frame. The vector is used to query the corresponding frame for mask generation. The memory also allows Locater to process videos with linear time complexity and constant size memory, while Transformer-style self-attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. To thoroughly examine the visual grounding capability of LVS models, we contribute a new LVS dataset, A2D-S+, which is built upon A2D-S dataset but poses increased challenges in disambiguating among similar objects. Experiments on three LVS datasets and our A2D-S+ show that Locater outperforms previous state-of-the-arts. Further, we won the 1st place in the Referring Video Object Segmentation Track of the 3rd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge, where Locater served as the foundation for the winning solution. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/leonnnop/Locater"
2203.11160,Drive&Segment: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes via   Cross-modal Distillation,"This work investigates learning pixel-wise semantic image segmentation in urban scenes without any manual annotation, just from the raw non-curated data collected by cars which, equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors, drive around a city. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a novel method for cross-modal unsupervised learning of semantic image segmentation by leveraging synchronized LiDAR and image data. The key ingredient of our method is the use of an object proposal module that analyzes the LiDAR point cloud to obtain proposals for spatially consistent objects. Second, we show that these 3D object proposals can be aligned with the input images and reliably clustered into semantically meaningful pseudo-classes. Finally, we develop a cross-modal distillation approach that leverages image data partially annotated with the resulting pseudo-classes to train a transformer-based model for image semantic segmentation. We show the generalization capabilities of our method by testing on four different testing datasets (Cityscapes, Dark Zurich, Nighttime Driving and ACDC) without any finetuning, and demonstrate significant improvements compared to the current state of the art on this problem. See project webpage https://vobecant.github.io/DriveAndSegment/ for the code and more."
2203.11242,"A survey on GANs for computer vision: Recent research, analysis and   taxonomy","In the last few years, there have been several revolutions in the field of deep learning, mainly headlined by the large impact of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs not only provide an unique architecture when defining their models, but also generate incredible results which have had a direct impact on society. Due to the significant improvements and new areas of research that GANs have brought, the community is constantly coming up with new researches that make it almost impossible to keep up with the times. Our survey aims to provide a general overview of GANs, showing the latest architectures, optimizations of the loss functions, validation metrics and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. The efficiency of the different variants of the model architecture will be evaluated, as well as showing the best application area; as a vital part of the process, the different metrics for evaluating the performance of GANs and the frequently used loss functions will be analyzed. The final objective of this survey is to provide a summary of the evolution and performance of the GANs which are having better results to guide future researchers in the field."
2203.11442,Scalable Video Object Segmentation with Identification Mechanism,"This paper delves into the challenges of achieving scalable and effective multi-object modeling for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Previous VOS methods decode features with a single positive object, limiting the learning of multi-object representation as they must match and segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios. Additionally, earlier techniques catered to specific application objectives and lacked the flexibility to fulfill different speed-accuracy requirements. To address these problems, we present two innovative approaches, Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) and Associating Objects with Scalable Transformers (AOST). In pursuing effective multi-object modeling, AOT introduces the IDentification (ID) mechanism to allocate each object a unique identity. This approach enables the network to model the associations among all objects simultaneously, thus facilitating the tracking and segmentation of objects in a single network pass. To address the challenge of inflexible deployment, AOST further integrates scalable long short-term transformers that incorporate scalable supervision and layer-wise ID-based attention. This enables online architecture scalability in VOS for the first time and overcomes ID embeddings' representation limitations. Given the absence of a benchmark for VOS involving densely multi-object annotations, we propose a challenging Video Object Segmentation in the Wild (VOSW) benchmark to validate our approaches. We evaluated various AOT and AOST variants using extensive experiments across VOSW and five commonly used VOS benchmarks, including YouTube-VOS 2018 & 2019 Val, DAVIS-2017 Val & Test, and DAVIS-2016. Our approaches surpass the state-of-the-art competitors and display exceptional efficiency and scalability consistently across all six benchmarks.

2203.11537,Convolutional Neural Network-based Efficient Dense Point Cloud   Generation using Unsigned Distance Fields,"Dense point cloud generation from a sparse or incomplete point cloud is a crucial and challenging problem in 3D computer vision and computer graphics. So far, the existing methods are either computationally too expensive, suffer from limited resolution, or both. In addition, some methods are strictly limited to watertight surfaces -- another major obstacle for a number of applications. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network that learns and predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes for dense point cloud generation using the recently emerged concept of implicit function learning. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state of the art by 7.8x less model parameters, 2.4x faster inference time and up to 24.8% improved generation quality compared to the state-of-the-art."
2203.11593,Unified Negative Pair Generation toward Well-discriminative Feature   Space for Face Recognition,"The goal of face recognition (FR) can be viewed as a pair similarity optimization problem, maximizing a similarity set $\mathcal{S}^p$ over positive pairs, while minimizing similarity set $\mathcal{S}^n$ over negative pairs. Ideally, it is expected that FR models form a well-discriminative feature space (WDFS) that satisfies $\inf{\mathcal{S}^p} > \sup{\mathcal{S}^n}$. With regard to WDFS, the existing deep feature learning paradigms (i.e., metric and classification losses) can be expressed as a unified perspective on different pair generation (PG) strategies. Unfortunately, in the metric loss (ML), it is infeasible to generate negative pairs taking all classes into account in each iteration because of the limited mini-batch size. In contrast, in classification loss (CL), it is difficult to generate extremely hard negative pairs owing to the convergence of the class weight vectors to their center. This leads to a mismatch between the two similarity distributions of the sampled pairs and all negative pairs. Thus, this paper proposes a unified negative pair generation (UNPG) by combining two PG strategies (i.e., MLPG and CLPG) from a unified perspective to alleviate the mismatch. UNPG introduces useful information about negative pairs using MLPG to overcome the CLPG deficiency. Moreover, it includes filtering the similarities of noisy negative pairs to guarantee reliable convergence and improved performance. Exhaustive experiments show the superiority of UNPG by achieving state-of-the-art performance across recent loss functions on public benchmark datasets. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available."
2203.12082,PlaneMVS: 3D Plane Reconstruction from Multi-View Stereo,"We present a novel framework named PlaneMVS for 3D plane reconstruction from multiple input views with known camera poses. Most previous learning-based plane reconstruction methods reconstruct 3D planes from single images, which highly rely on single-view regression and suffer from depth scale ambiguity. In contrast, we reconstruct 3D planes with a multi-view-stereo (MVS) pipeline that takes advantage of multi-view geometry. We decouple plane reconstruction into a semantic plane detection branch and a plane MVS branch. The semantic plane detection branch is based on a single-view plane detection framework but with differences. The plane MVS branch adopts a set of slanted plane hypotheses to replace conventional depth hypotheses to perform plane sweeping strategy and finally learns pixel-level plane parameters and its planar depth map. We present how the two branches are learned in a balanced way, and propose a soft-pooling loss to associate the outputs of the two branches and make them benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on various indoor datasets show that PlaneMVS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-view plane reconstruction methods on both plane detection and 3D geometry metrics. Our method even outperforms a set of SOTA learning-based MVS methods thanks to the learned plane priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on 3D plane reconstruction within an end-to-end MVS framework. Source code: https://github.com/oppo-us-research/PlaneMVS."
2203.12362,MONAI Label: A framework for AI-assisted Interactive Labeling of 3D   Medical Images,"The lack of annotated datasets is a major bottleneck for training new task-specific supervised machine learning models, considering that manual annotation is extremely expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, we present MONAI Label, a free and open-source framework that facilitates the development of applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) models that aim at reducing the time required to annotate radiology datasets. Through MONAI Label, researchers can develop AI annotation applications focusing on their domain of expertise. It allows researchers to readily deploy their apps as services, which can be made available to clinicians via their preferred user interface. Currently, MONAI Label readily supports locally installed (3D Slicer) and web-based (OHIF) frontends and offers two active learning strategies to facilitate and speed up the training of segmentation algorithms. MONAI Label allows researchers to make incremental improvements to their AI-based annotation application by making them available to other researchers and clinicians alike. Additionally, MONAI Label provides sample AI-based interactive and non-interactive labeling applications, that can be used directly off the shelf, as plug-and-play to any given dataset. Significant reduced annotation times using the interactive model can be observed on two public datasets."
2203.12446,SMEMO: Social Memory for Trajectory Forecasting,"Effective modeling of human interactions is of utmost importance when forecasting behaviors such as future trajectories. Each individual, with its motion, influences surrounding agents since everyone obeys to social non-written rules such as collision avoidance or group following. In this paper we model such interactions, which constantly evolve through time, by looking at the problem from an algorithmic point of view, i.e. as a data manipulation task. We present a neural network based on an end-to-end trainable working memory, which acts as an external storage where information about each agent can be continuously written, updated and recalled. We show that our method is capable of learning explainable cause-effect relationships between motions of different agents, obtaining state-of-the-art results on multiple trajectory forecasting datasets."
2203.12476,Stable Optimization for Large Vision Model Based Deep Image Prior in   Cone-Beam CT Reconstruction,"Large Vision Model (LVM) has recently demonstrated great potential for medical imaging tasks, potentially enabling image enhancement for sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), despite requiring a substantial amount of data for training. Meanwhile, Deep Image Prior (DIP) effectively guides an untrained neural network to generate high-quality CBCT images without any training data. However, the original DIP method relies on a well-defined forward model and a large-capacity backbone network, which is notoriously difficult to converge. In this paper, we propose a stable optimization method for the forward-model-free, LVM-based DIP model for sparse-view CBCT. Our approach consists of two main characteristics: (1) multi-scale perceptual loss (MSPL) which measures the similarity of perceptual features between the reference and output images at multiple resolutions without the need for any forward model, and (2) a reweighting mechanism that stabilizes the iteration trajectory of MSPL. One shot optimization is used to simultaneously and stably reweight MSPL and optimize LVM. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets: SPARE and Walnut. The results show significant improvements in both image quality metrics and visualization that demonstrates reduced streak artifacts. The source code is available upon request."
2203.12985,Learning Disentangled Representation for One-shot Progressive Face   Swapping,"Although face swapping has attracted much attention in recent years, it remains a challenging problem. Existing methods leverage a large number of data samples to explore the intrinsic properties of face swapping without considering the semantic information of face images. Moreover, the representation of the identity information tends to be fixed, leading to suboptimal face swapping. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient method named FaceSwapper, for one-shot face swapping based on Generative Adversarial Networks. Our method consists of a disentangled representation module and a semantic-guided fusion module. The disentangled representation module comprises an attribute encoder and an identity encoder, which aims to achieve the disentanglement of the identity and attribute information. The identity encoder is more flexible, and the attribute encoder contains more attribute details than its competitors. Benefiting from the disentangled representation, FaceSwapper can swap face images progressively. In addition, semantic information is introduced into the semantic-guided fusion module to control the swapped region and model the pose and expression more accurately. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with fewer training samples. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/liqi-casia/FaceSwapper."
2203.13310,MonoDETR: Depth-guided Transformer for Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Monocular 3D object detection has long been a challenging task in autonomous driving. Most existing methods follow conventional 2D detectors to first localize object centers, and then predict 3D attributes by neighboring features. However, only using local visual features is insufficient to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignores the long-range inter-object depth relations. In this paper, we introduce the first DETR framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named MonoDETR. We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the whole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to the visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a foreground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth embeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and propose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In this way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual features. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations. Besides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance multi-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior generalization capacity. Code is available at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/MonoDETR."
2203.13453,Model LEGO: Creating Models Like Disassembling and Assembling Building   Blocks,"With the rapid development of deep learning, the increasing complexity and scale of parameters make training a new model increasingly resource-intensive. In this paper, we start from the classic convolutional neural network (CNN) and explore a paradigm that does not require training to obtain new models. Similar to the birth of CNN inspired by receptive fields in the biological visual system, we draw inspiration from the information subsystem pathways in the biological visual system and propose Model Disassembling and Assembling (MDA). During model disassembling, we introduce the concept of relative contribution and propose a component locating technique to extract task-aware components from trained CNN classifiers. For model assembling, we present the alignment padding strategy and parameter scaling strategy to construct a new model tailored for a specific task, utilizing the disassembled task-aware components. The entire process is akin to playing with LEGO bricks, enabling arbitrary assembly of new models, and providing a novel perspective for model creation and reuse. Extensive experiments showcase that task-aware components disassembled from CNN classifiers or new models assembled using these components closely match or even surpass the performance of the baseline, demonstrating its promising results for model reuse. Furthermore, MDA exhibits diverse potential applications, with comprehensive experiments exploring model decision route analysis, model compression, knowledge distillation, and more. The code is available at https://github.com/jiaconghu/Model-LEGO."
2203.13674,Dense Continuous-Time Optical Flow from Events and Frames,"We present a method for estimating dense continuous-time optical flow from event data. Traditional dense optical flow methods compute the pixel displacement between two images. Due to missing information, these approaches cannot recover the pixel trajectories in the blind time between two images. In this work, we show that it is possible to compute per-pixel, continuous-time optical flow using events from an event camera. Events provide temporally fine-grained information about movement in pixel space due to their asynchronous nature and microsecond response time. We leverage these benefits to predict pixel trajectories densely in continuous time via parameterized B\'ezier curves. To achieve this, we build a neural network with strong inductive biases for this task: First, we build multiple sequential correlation volumes in time using event data. Second, we use B\'ezier curves to index these correlation volumes at multiple timestamps along the trajectory. Third, we use the retrieved correlation to update the B\'ezier curve representations iteratively. Our method can optionally include image pairs to boost performance further. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first method that can regress dense pixel trajectories from event data. To train and evaluate our model, we introduce a synthetic dataset (MultiFlow) that features moving objects and ground truth trajectories for every pixel. Our quantitative experiments not only suggest that our method successfully predicts pixel trajectories in continuous time but also that it is competitive in the traditional two-view pixel displacement metric on MultiFlow and DSEC-Flow. Open source code and datasets are released to the public."
2203.13704,Clustering Aided Weakly Supervised Training to Detect Anomalous Events   in Surveillance Videos,"Formulating learning systems for the detection of real-world anomalous events using only video-level labels is a challenging task mainly due to the presence of noisy labels as well as the rare occurrence of anomalous events in the training data. We propose a weakly supervised anomaly detection system which has multiple contributions including a random batch selection mechanism to reduce inter-batch correlation and a normalcy suppression block which learns to minimize anomaly scores over normal regions of a video by utilizing the overall information available in a training batch. In addition, a clustering loss block is proposed to mitigate the label noise and to improve the representation learning for the anomalous and normal regions. This block encourages the backbone network to produce two distinct feature clusters representing normal and anomalous events. Extensive analysis of the proposed approach is provided using three popular anomaly detection datasets including UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and UCSD Ped2. The experiments demonstrate a superior anomaly detection capability of our approach."
2203.13716,Stabilizing Adversarially Learned One-Class Novelty Detection Using   Pseudo Anomalies,"Recently, anomaly scores have been formulated using reconstruction loss of the adversarially learned generators and/or classification loss of discriminators. Unavailability of anomaly examples in the training data makes optimization of such networks challenging. Attributed to the adversarial training, performance of such models fluctuates drastically with each training step, making it difficult to halt the training at an optimal point. In the current study, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that overcomes such instability by transforming the fundamental role of the discriminator from identifying real vs. fake data to distinguishing good vs. bad quality reconstructions. For this purpose, we propose a method that utilizes the current state as well as an old state of the same generator to create good and bad quality reconstruction examples. The discriminator is trained on these examples to detect the subtle distortions that are often present in the reconstructions of anomalous data. In addition, we propose an efficient generic criterion to stop the training of our model, ensuring elevated performance. Extensive experiments performed on six datasets across multiple domains including image and video based anomaly detection, medical diagnosis, and network security, have demonstrated excellent performance of our approach."
2203.13718,Digital Fingerprinting of Microstructures,"Finding efficient means of fingerprinting microstructural information is a critical step towards harnessing data-centric machine learning approaches. A statistical framework is systematically developed for compressed characterisation of a population of images, which includes some classical computer vision methods as special cases. The focus is on materials microstructure. The ultimate purpose is to rapidly fingerprint sample images in the context of various high-throughput design/make/test scenarios. This includes, but is not limited to, quantification of the disparity between microstructures for quality control, classifying microstructures, predicting materials properties from image data and identifying potential processing routes to engineer new materials with specific properties. Here, we consider microstructure classification and utilise the resulting features over a range of related machine learning tasks, namely supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning.   The approach is applied to two distinct datasets to illustrate various aspects and some recommendations are made based on the findings. In particular, methods that leverage transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, are generally shown to outperform other methods. Additionally, dimensionality reduction of these CNN-based fingerprints is shown to have negligible impact on classification accuracy for the supervised learning approaches considered. In situations where there is a large dataset with only a handful of images labelled, graph-based label propagation to unlabelled data is shown to be favourable over discarding unlabelled data and performing supervised learning. In particular, label propagation by Poisson learning is shown to be highly effective at low label rates."
2203.13792,Visual-based Safe Landing for UAVs in Populated Areas: Real-time   Validation in Virtual Environments,"Safe autonomous landing for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in populated areas is a crucial aspect for successful urban deployment, particularly in emergency landing situations. Nonetheless, validating autonomous landing in real scenarios is a challenging task involving a high risk of injuring people. In this work, we propose a framework for real-time safe and thorough evaluation of vision-based autonomous landing in populated scenarios, using photo-realistic virtual environments. We propose to use the Unreal graphics engine coupled with the AirSim plugin for drone's simulation, and evaluate autonomous landing strategies based on visual detection of Safe Landing Zones (SLZ) in populated scenarios. Then, we study two different criteria for selecting the ""best"" SLZ, and evaluate them during autonomous landing of a virtual drone in different scenarios and conditions, under different distributions of people in urban scenes, including moving people. We evaluate different metrics to quantify the performance of the landing strategies, establishing a baseline for comparison with future works in this challenging task, and analyze them through an important number of randomized iterations. The study suggests that the use of the autonomous landing algorithms considerably helps to prevent accidents involving humans, which may allow to unleash the full potential of drones in urban environments near to people."
2203.13856,Robust deep learning for eye fundus images: Bridging real and synthetic   data for enhancing generalization,"Deep learning applications for assessing medical images are limited because the datasets are often small and imbalanced. The use of synthetic data has been proposed in the literature, but neither a robust comparison of the different methods nor generalizability has been reported. Our approach integrates a retinal image quality assessment model and StyleGAN2 architecture to enhance Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) detection capabilities and improve generalizability. This work compares ten different Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures to generate synthetic eye-fundus images with and without AMD. We combined subsets of three public databases (iChallenge-AMD, ODIR-2019, and RIADD) to form a single training and test set. We employed the STARE dataset for external validation, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the proposed approach. The results show that StyleGAN2 reached the lowest Frechet Inception Distance (166.17), and clinicians could not accurately differentiate between real and synthetic images. ResNet-18 architecture obtained the best performance with 85% accuracy and outperformed the two human experts (80% and 75%) in detecting AMD fundus images. The accuracy rates were 82.8% for the test set and 81.3% for the STARE dataset, demonstrating the model's generalizability. The proposed methodology for synthetic medical image generation has been validated for robustness and accuracy, with free access to its code for further research and development in this field."
2203.13883,"Multi-modal Misinformation Detection: Approaches, Challenges and   Opportunities","As social media platforms are evolving from text-based forums into multi-modal environments, the nature of misinformation in social media is also transforming accordingly. Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection."
2203.13987,On the Viability of Monocular Depth Pre-training for Semantic   Segmentation,"The question of whether pre-training on geometric tasks is viable for downstream transfer to semantic tasks is important for two reasons, one practical and the other scientific. If the answer is positive, we may be able to reduce pre-training cost and bias from human annotators significantly. If the answer is negative, it may shed light on the role of embodiment in the emergence of language and other cognitive functions in evolutionary history. To frame the question in a way that is testable with current means, we pre-train a model on a geometric task, and test whether that can be used to prime a notion of 'object' that enables inference of semantics as soon as symbols (labels) are assigned. We choose monocular depth prediction as the geometric task, and semantic segmentation as the downstream semantic task, and design a collection of empirical tests by exploring different forms of supervision, training pipelines, and data sources for both depth pre-training and semantic fine-tuning. We find that monocular depth is a viable form of pre-training for semantic segmentation, validated by improvements over common baselines. Based on the findings, we propose several possible mechanisms behind the improvements, including their relation to dataset size, resolution, architecture, in/out-of-domain source data, and validate them through a wide range of ablation studies. We also find that optical flow, which at first glance may seem as good as depth prediction since it optimizes the same photometric reprojection error, is considerably less effective, as it does not explicitly aim to infer the latent structure of the scene, but rather the raw phenomenology of temporally adjacent images."
2203.14045,Adaptively Enhancing Facial Expression Crucial Regions via Local   Non-Local Joint Network,"Facial expression recognition (FER) is still one challenging research due to the small inter-class discrepancy in the facial expression data. In view of the significance of facial crucial regions for FER, many existing researches utilize the prior information from some annotated crucial points to improve the performance of FER. However, it is complicated and time-consuming to manually annotate facial crucial points, especially for vast wild expression images. Based on this, a local non-local joint network is proposed to adaptively light up the facial crucial regions in feature learning of FER in this paper. In the proposed method, two parts are constructed based on facial local and non-local information respectively, where an ensemble of multiple local networks are proposed to extract local features corresponding to multiple facial local regions and a non-local attention network is addressed to explore the significance of each local region. Especially, the attention weights obtained by the non-local network is fed into the local part to achieve the interactive feedback between the facial global and local information. Interestingly, the non-local weights corresponding to local regions are gradually updated and higher weights are given to more crucial regions. Moreover, U-Net is employed to extract the integrated features of deep semantic information and low hierarchical detail information of expression images. Finally, experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves more competitive performance compared with several state-of-the art methods on five benchmark datasets. Noticeably, the analyses of the non-local weights corresponding to local regions demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically enhance some crucial regions in the process of feature learning without any facial landmark information."
2203.14523,Translation Consistent Semi-supervised Segmentation for 3D Medical Images,"3D medical image segmentation methods have been successful, but their dependence on large amounts of voxel-level annotated data is a disadvantage that needs to be addressed given the high cost to obtain such annotation. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) solve this issue by training models with a large unlabelled and a small labelled dataset. The most successful SSL approaches are based on consistency learning that minimises the distance between model responses obtained from perturbed views of the unlabelled data. These perturbations usually keep the spatial input context between views fairly consistent, which may cause the model to learn segmentation patterns from the spatial input contexts instead of the segmented objects. In this paper, we introduce the Translation Consistent Co-training (TraCoCo) which is a consistency learning SSL method that perturbs the input data views by varying their spatial input context, allowing the model to learn segmentation patterns from visual objects. Furthermore, we propose the replacement of the commonly used mean squared error (MSE) semi-supervised loss by a new Cross-model confident Binary Cross entropy (CBC) loss, which improves training convergence and keeps the robustness to co-training pseudo-labelling mistakes. We also extend CutMix augmentation to 3D SSL to further improve generalisation. Our TraCoCo shows state-of-the-art results for the Left Atrium (LA) and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRaTS19) datasets with different backbones. Our code is available at https://github.com/yyliu01/TraCoCo."
2203.14779,A Joint Cross-Attention Model for Audio-Visual Fusion in Dimensional   Emotion Recognition,"Multimodal emotion recognition has recently gained much attention since it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple modalities (e.g., audio, visual, biosignals, etc.), and can provide some robustness to noisy modalities. Most state-of-the-art methods for audio-visual (A-V) fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of A-V modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a joint cross-attention model that relies on the complementary relationships to extract the salient features across A-V modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of continuous values of valence and arousal. The proposed fusion model efficiently leverages the inter-modal relationships, while reducing the heterogeneity between the features. In particular, it computes the cross-attention weights based on correlation between the combined feature representation and individual modalities. By deploying the combined A-V feature representation into the cross-attention module, the performance of our fusion module improves significantly over the vanilla cross-attention module. Experimental results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed A-V fusion model provides a cost-effective solution that can outperform state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/praveena2j/JointCrossAttentional-AV-Fusion."
2203.16000,StyleFool: Fooling Video Classification Systems via Style Transfer,"Video classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can create severe security problems in video verification. Current black-box attacks need a large number of queries to succeed, resulting in high computational overhead in the process of attack. On the other hand, attacks with restricted perturbations are ineffective against defenses such as denoising or adversarial training. In this paper, we focus on unrestricted perturbations and propose StyleFool, a black-box video adversarial attack via style transfer to fool the video classification system. StyleFool first utilizes color theme proximity to select the best style image, which helps avoid unnatural details in the stylized videos. Meanwhile, the target class confidence is additionally considered in targeted attacks to influence the output distribution of the classifier by moving the stylized video closer to or even across the decision boundary. A gradient-free method is then employed to further optimize the adversarial perturbations. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate StyleFool on two standard datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51. The experimental results demonstrate that StyleFool outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in terms of both the number of queries and the robustness against existing defenses. Moreover, 50% of the stylized videos in untargeted attacks do not need any query since they can already fool the video classification model. Furthermore, we evaluate the indistinguishability through a user study to show that the adversarial samples of StyleFool look imperceptible to human eyes, despite unrestricted perturbations."
2203.16031,"How Deep is Your Art: An Experimental Study on the Limits of Artistic   Understanding in a Single-Task, Single-Modality Neural Network","Computational modeling of artwork meaning is complex and difficult. This is because art interpretation is multidimensional and highly subjective. This paper experimentally investigated the degree to which a state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), a popular Machine Learning approach, can correctly distinguish modern conceptual art work into the galleries devised by art curators. Two hypotheses were proposed to state that the DCNN model uses Exhibited Properties for classification, like shape and color, but not Non-Exhibited Properties, such as historical context and artist intention. The two hypotheses were experimentally validated using a methodology designed for this purpose. VGG-11 DCNN pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and discriminatively fine-tuned was trained on handcrafted datasets designed from real-world conceptual photography galleries. Experimental results supported the two hypotheses showing that the DCNN model ignores Non-Exhibited Properties and uses only Exhibited Properties for artwork classification. This work points to current DCNN limitations, which should be addressed by future DNN models."
2203.16414,Surface Vision Transformers: Attention-Based Modelling applied to   Cortical Analysis,"The extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean geometries has led to multiple frameworks for studying manifolds. Many of those methods have shown design limitations resulting in poor modelling of long-range associations, as the generalisation of convolutions to irregular surfaces is non-trivial. Motivated by the success of attention-modelling in computer vision, we translate convolution-free vision transformer approaches to surface data, to introduce a domain-agnostic architecture to study any surface data projected onto a spherical manifold. Here, surface patching is achieved by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches, extracted from a subdivided icosphere. A transformer model encodes the sequence of patches via successive multi-head self-attention layers while preserving the sequence resolution. We validate the performance of the proposed Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) on the task of phenotype regression from cortical surface metrics derived from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Experiments show that the SiT generally outperforms surface CNNs, while performing comparably on registered and unregistered data. Analysis of transformer attention maps offers strong potential to characterise subtle cognitive developmental patterns."
2203.17255,A Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness and Artificial   Superintelligence: Thought Is Structured by the Iterative Updating of Working   Memory,"This article provides an analytical framework for how to simulate human-like thought processes within a computer. It describes how attention and memory should be structured, updated, and utilized to search for associative additions to the stream of thought. The focus is on replicating the dynamics of the mammalian working memory system, which features two forms of persistent activity: sustained firing (preserving information on the order of seconds) and synaptic potentiation (preserving information from minutes to hours). The article uses a series of figures to systematically demonstrate how the iterative updating of these working memory stores provides functional organization to behavior, cognition, and awareness.   In a machine learning implementation, these two memory stores should be updated continuously and in an iterative fashion. This means each state should preserve a proportion of the coactive representations from the state before it (where each representation is an ensemble of neural network nodes). This makes each state a revised iteration of the preceding state and causes successive configurations to overlap and blend with respect to the information they contain. Thus, the set of concepts in working memory will evolve gradually and incrementally over time. Transitions between states happen as persistent activity spreads activation energy throughout the hierarchical network, searching long-term memory for the most appropriate representation to be added to the global workspace. The result is a chain of associatively linked intermediate states capable of advancing toward a solution or goal. Iterative updating is conceptualized here as an information processing strategy, a model of working memory, a theory of consciousness, and an algorithm for designing and programming artificial intelligence (AI, AGI, and ASI)."
2204.00486,"GEB+: A Benchmark for Generic Event Boundary Captioning, Grounding and   Retrieval","Cognitive science has shown that humans perceive videos in terms of events separated by the state changes of dominant subjects. State changes trigger new events and are one of the most useful among the large amount of redundant information perceived. However, previous research focuses on the overall understanding of segments without evaluating the fine-grained status changes inside. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called Kinetic-GEB+. The dataset consists of over 170k boundaries associated with captions describing status changes in the generic events in 12K videos. Upon this new dataset, we propose three tasks supporting the development of a more fine-grained, robust, and human-like understanding of videos through status changes. We evaluate many representative baselines in our dataset, where we also design a new TPD (Temporal-based Pairwise Difference) Modeling method for visual difference and achieve significant performance improvements. Besides, the results show there are still formidable challenges for current methods in the utilization of different granularities, representation of visual difference, and the accurate localization of status changes. Further analysis shows that our dataset can drive developing more powerful methods to understand status changes and thus improve video level comprehension. The dataset including both videos and boundaries is available at https://yuxuan-w.github.io/GEB-plus/"
2204.00951,"A Sentinel-2 multi-year, multi-country benchmark dataset for crop   classification and segmentation with deep learning","In this work we introduce Sen4AgriNet, a Sentinel-2 based time series multi country benchmark dataset, tailored for agricultural monitoring applications with Machine and Deep Learning. Sen4AgriNet dataset is annotated from farmer declarations collected via the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) for harmonizing country wide labels. These declarations have only recently been made available as open data, allowing for the first time the labeling of satellite imagery from ground truth data. We proceed to propose and standardise a new crop type taxonomy across Europe that address Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) needs, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Indicative Crop Classification scheme. Sen4AgriNet is the only multi-country, multi-year dataset that includes all spectral information. It is constructed to cover the period 2016-2020 for Catalonia and France, while it can be extended to include additional countries. Currently, it contains 42.5 million parcels, which makes it significantly larger than other available archives. We extract two sub-datasets to highlight its value for diverse Deep Learning applications; the Object Aggregated Dataset (OAD) and the Patches Assembled Dataset (PAD). OAD capitalizes zonal statistics of each parcel, thus creating a powerful label-to-features instance for classification algorithms. On the other hand, PAD structure generalizes the classification problem to parcel extraction and semantic segmentation and labeling. The PAD and OAD are examined under three different scenarios to showcase and model the effects of spatial and temporal variability across different years and different countries."
2204.01324,Outlier-Robust Geometric Perception: A Novel Thresholding-Based   Estimator with Intra-Class Variance Maximization,"Geometric perception problems are fundamental tasks in robotics and computer vision. In real-world applications, they often encounter the inevitable issue of outliers, preventing traditional algorithms from making correct estimates. In this paper, we present a novel general-purpose robust estimator TIVM (Thresholding with Intra-class Variance Maximization) that can collaborate with standard non-minimal solvers to efficiently reject outliers for geometric perception problems. First, we introduce the technique of intra-class variance maximization to design a dynamic 2-group thresholding method on the measurement residuals, aiming to distinctively separate inliers from outliers. Then, we develop an iterative framework that robustly optimizes the model by approaching the pure-inlier group using a multi-layered dynamic thresholding strategy as subroutine, in which a self-adaptive mechanism for layer-number tuning is further employed to minimize the user-defined parameters. We validate the proposed estimator on 3 classic geometric perception problems: rotation averaging, point cloud registration and category-level perception, and experiments show that it is robust against 70--90\% of outliers and can converge typically in only 3--15 iterations, much faster than state-of-the-art robust solvers such as RANSAC, GNC and ADAPT. Furthermore, another highlight is that: our estimator can retain approximately the same level of robustness even when the inlier-noise statistics of the problem are fully unknown."
2204.01348,Extended Reality for Mental Health Evaluation -A Scoping Review,"Mental health disorders are the leading cause of health-related problems globally. It is projected that mental health disorders will be the leading cause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and depression grows globally. Recently, extended reality (XR), a general term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR), is paving a new way to deliver mental health care. In this paper, we conduct a scoping review on the development and application of XR in the area of mental disorders. We performed a scoping database search to identify the relevant studies indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and the ACM Digital Library. A search period between August 2016 and December 2023 was defined to select articles related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. We identified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries across the globe. By performing data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on developed countries such as the US (16.47%) and Germany (12.94%). None of the studies were for African countries. The majority of the articles reported that XR techniques led to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or depression. More studies were published in the year 2021, i.e., 31.76% (n = 31). This could indicate that mental disorder intervention received a higher attention when COVID-19 emerged. Most studies (n = 65) focused on a population between 18 and 65 years old, only a few studies focused on teenagers (n = 2). Also, more studies were done experimentally (n = 67, 78.82%) rather than by analytical and modeling approaches (n = 8, 9.41%). This shows that there is a rapid development of XR technology for mental health care. Furthermore, these studies showed that XR technology can effectively be used for evaluating mental disorders in similar or better way as the conventional approaches."
2204.01349,MGRR-Net: Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network for Facial   Action Units Detection,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) encodes the action units (AUs) in facial images, which has attracted extensive research attention due to its wide use in facial expression analysis. Many methods that perform well on automatic facial action unit (AU) detection primarily focus on modeling various types of AU relations between corresponding local muscle areas, or simply mining global attention-aware facial features, however, neglect the dynamic interactions among local-global features. We argue that encoding AU features just from one perspective may not capture the rich contextual information between regional and global face features, as well as the detailed variability across AUs, because of the diversity in expression and individual characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network (termed MGRR-Net) for facial AU detection. Each layer of MGRR-Net performs a multi-level (i.e., region-level, pixel-wise and channel-wise level) feature learning. While the region-level feature learning from local face patches features via graph neural network can encode the correlation across different AUs, the pixel-wise and channel-wise feature learning via graph attention network can enhance the discrimination ability of AU features from global face features. The fused features from the three levels lead to improved AU discriminative ability. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods."
2204.01645,3D microstructural generation from 2D images of cement paste using   generative adversarial networks,"Establishing a realistic three-dimensional (3D) microstructure is a crucial step for studying microstructure development of hardened cement pastes. However, acquiring 3D microstructural images for cement often involves high costs and quality compromises. This paper proposes a generative adversarial networks-based method for generating 3D microstructures from a single two-dimensional (2D) image, capable of producing high-quality and realistic 3D images at low cost. In the method, a framework (CEM3DMG) is designed to synthesize 3D images by learning microstructural information from a 2D cross-sectional image. Experimental results show that CEM3DMG can generate realistic 3D images of large size. Visual observation confirms that the generated 3D images exhibit similar microstructural features to the 2D images, including similar pore distribution and particle morphology. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals that reconstructed 3D microstructures closely match the real 2D microstructure in terms of gray level histogram, phase proportions, and pore size distribution. The source code for CEM3DMG is available in the GitHub repository at: https://github.com/NBICLAB/CEM3DMG."
2204.01811,Towards Infield Navigation: leveraging simulated data for crop row   detection,"Agricultural datasets for crop row detection are often bound by their limited number of images. This restricts the researchers from developing deep learning based models for precision agricultural tasks involving crop row detection. We suggest the utilization of small real-world datasets along with additional data generated by simulations to yield similar crop row detection performance as that of a model trained with a large real world dataset. Our method could reach the performance of a deep learning based crop row detection model trained with real-world data by using 60% less labelled real-world data. Our model performed well against field variations such as shadows, sunlight and grow stages. We introduce an automated pipeline to generate labelled images for crop row detection in simulation domain. An extensive comparison is done to analyze the contribution of simulated data towards reaching robust crop row detection in various real-world field scenarios."
2204.02010,LatentGAN Autoencoder: Learning Disentangled Latent Distribution,"In autoencoder, the encoder generally approximates the latent distribution over the dataset, and the decoder generates samples using this learned latent distribution. There is very little control over the latent vector as using the random latent vector for generation will lead to trivial outputs. This work tries to address this issue by using the LatentGAN generator to directly learn to approximate the latent distribution of the autoencoder and show meaningful results on MNIST, 3D Chair, and CelebA datasets, an additional information-theoretic constrain is used which successfully learns to control autoencoder latent distribution. With this, our model also achieves an error rate of 2.38 on MNIST unsupervised image classification, which is better as compared to InfoGAN and AAE."
2204.02283,Lost in Latent Space: Disentangled Models and the Challenge of   Combinatorial Generalisation,"Recent research has shown that generative models with highly disentangled representations fail to generalise to unseen combination of generative factor values. These findings contradict earlier research which showed improved performance in out-of-training distribution settings when compared to entangled representations. Additionally, it is not clear if the reported failures are due to (a) encoders failing to map novel combinations to the proper regions of the latent space or (b) novel combinations being mapped correctly but the decoder/downstream process is unable to render the correct output for the unseen combinations. We investigate these alternatives by testing several models on a range of datasets and training settings. We find that (i) when models fail, their encoders also fail to map unseen combinations to correct regions of the latent space and (ii) when models succeed, it is either because the test conditions do not exclude enough examples, or because excluded generative factors determine independent parts of the output image. Based on these results, we argue that to generalise properly, models not only need to capture factors of variation, but also understand how to invert the generative process that was used to generate the data."
2204.02688,MM-SEAL: A Large-scale Video Dataset of Multi-person Multi-grained   Spatio-temporally Action Localization,"In this paper, we introduce a novel large-scale video dataset dubbed MM-SEAL for multi-person multi-grained spatio-temporal action localization among human daily life. We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper."
2204.02779,A Dempster-Shafer approach to trustworthy AI with application to fetal   brain MRI segmentation,"Deep learning models for medical image segmentation can fail unexpectedly and spectacularly for pathological cases and images acquired at different centers than training images, with labeling errors that violate expert knowledge. Such errors undermine the trustworthiness of deep learning models for medical image segmentation. Mechanisms for detecting and correcting such failures are essential for safely translating this technology into clinics and are likely to be a requirement of future regulations on artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we propose a trustworthy AI theoretical framework and a practical system that can augment any backbone AI system using a fallback method and a fail-safe mechanism based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Our approach relies on an actionable definition of trustworthy AI. Our method automatically discards the voxel-level labeling predicted by the backbone AI that violate expert knowledge and relies on a fallback for those voxels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trustworthy AI approach on the largest reported annotated dataset of fetal MRI consisting of 540 manually annotated fetal brain 3D T2w MRIs from 13 centers. Our trustworthy AI method improves the robustness of a state-of-the-art backbone AI for fetal brain MRIs acquired across various centers and for fetuses with various brain abnormalities."
2204.02791,Implicit Motion-Compensated Network for Unsupervised Video Object   Segmentation,"Unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) aims at automatically separating the primary foreground object(s) from the background in a video sequence. Existing UVOS methods either lack robustness when there are visually similar surroundings (appearance-based) or suffer from deterioration in the quality of their predictions because of dynamic background and inaccurate flow (flow-based). To overcome the limitations, we propose an implicit motion-compensated network (IMCNet) combining complementary cues ($\textit{i.e.}$, appearance and motion) with aligned motion information from the adjacent frames to the current frame at the feature level without estimating optical flows. The proposed IMCNet consists of an affinity computing module (ACM), an attention propagation module (APM), and a motion compensation module (MCM). The light-weight ACM extracts commonality between neighboring input frames based on appearance features. The APM then transmits global correlation in a top-down manner. Through coarse-to-fine iterative inspiring, the APM will refine object regions from multiple resolutions so as to efficiently avoid losing details. Finally, the MCM aligns motion information from temporally adjacent frames to the current frame which achieves implicit motion compensation at the feature level. We perform extensive experiments on $\textit{DAVIS}_{\textit{16}}$ and $\textit{YouTube-Objects}$. Our network achieves favorable performance while running at a faster speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
2204.03139,DiffCloud: Real-to-Sim from Point Clouds with Differentiable Simulation and Rendering of Deformable Objects,"Research in manipulation of deformable objects is typically conducted on a limited range of scenarios, because handling each scenario on hardware takes significant effort. Realistic simulators with support for various types of deformations and interactions have the potential to speed up experimentation with novel tasks and algorithms. However, for highly deformable objects it is challenging to align the output of a simulator with the behavior of real objects. Manual tuning is not intuitive, hence automated methods are needed. We view this alignment problem as a joint perception-inference challenge and demonstrate how to use recent neural network architectures to successfully perform simulation parameter inference from real point clouds. We analyze the performance of various architectures, comparing their data and training requirements. Furthermore, we propose to leverage differentiable point cloud sampling and differentiable simulation to significantly reduce the time to achieve the alignment. We employ an efficient way to propagate gradients from point clouds to simulated meshes and further through to the physical simulation parameters, such as mass and stiffness. Experiments with highly deformable objects show that our method can achieve comparable or better alignment with real object behavior, while reducing the time needed to achieve this by more than an order of magnitude. Videos and supplementary material are available at https://diffcloud.github.io."
2204.03161,Flexible Sampling for Long-tailed Skin Lesion Classification,"Most of the medical tasks naturally exhibit a long-tailed distribution due to the complex patient-level conditions and the existence of rare diseases. Existing long-tailed learning methods usually treat each class equally to re-balance the long-tailed distribution. However, considering that some challenging classes may present diverse intra-class distributions, re-balancing all classes equally may lead to a significant performance drop. To address this, in this paper, we propose a curriculum learning-based framework called Flexible Sampling for the long-tailed skin lesion classification task. Specifically, we initially sample a subset of training data as anchor points based on the individual class prototypes. Then, these anchor points are used to pre-train an inference model to evaluate the per-class learning difficulty. Finally, we use a curriculum sampling module to dynamically query new samples from the rest training samples with the learning difficulty-aware sampling probability. We evaluated our model against several state-of-the-art methods on the ISIC dataset. The results with two long-tailed settings have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed training strategy, which achieves a new benchmark for long-tailed skin lesion classification."
2204.03197,MDA GAN: Adversarial-Learning-based 3-D Seismic Data Interpolation and   Reconstruction for Complex Missing,"The interpolation and reconstruction of missing traces is a crucial step in seismic data processing, moreover it is also a highly ill-posed problem, especially for complex cases such as high-ratio random discrete missing, continuous missing and missing in fault-rich or salt body surveys. These complex cases are rarely mentioned in current works. To cope with complex missing cases, we propose Multi-Dimensional Adversarial GAN (MDA GAN), a novel 3-D GAN framework. It keeps anisotropy and spatial continuity of the data after 3D complex missing reconstruction using three discriminators. The feature stitching module is designed and embedded in the generator to retain more information of the input data. The Tanh cross entropy (TCE) loss is derived, which provides the generator with the optimal reconstruction gradient to make the generated data smoother and continuous. We experimentally verified the effectiveness of the individual components of the study and then tested the method on multiple publicly available data. The method achieves reasonable reconstructions for up to 95% of random discrete missing and 100 traces of continuous missing. In fault and salt body enriched surveys, MDA GAN still yields promising results for complex cases. Experimentally it has been demonstrated that our method achieves better performance than other methods in both simple and complex cases.https://github.com/douyimin/MDA_GAN"
2204.03328,"A Comprehensive Review of Sign Language Recognition: Different Types,   Modalities, and Datasets","A machine can understand human activities, and the meaning of signs can help overcome the communication barriers between the inaudible and ordinary people. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a fascinating research area and a crucial task concerning computer vision and pattern recognition. Recently, SLR usage has increased in many applications, but the environment, background image resolution, modalities, and datasets affect the performance a lot. Many researchers have been striving to carry out generic real-time SLR models. This review paper facilitates a comprehensive overview of SLR and discusses the needs, challenges, and problems associated with SLR. We study related works about manual and non-manual, various modalities, and datasets. Research progress and existing state-of-the-art SLR models over the past decade have been reviewed. Finally, we find the research gap and limitations in this domain and suggest future directions. This review paper will be helpful for readers and researchers to get complete guidance about SLR and the progressive design of the state-of-the-art SLR model"
2204.03330,Learning Local and Global Temporal Contexts for Video Semantic   Segmentation,"Contextual information plays a core role for video semantic segmentation (VSS). This paper summarizes contexts for VSS in two-fold: local temporal contexts (LTC) which define the contexts from neighboring frames, and global temporal contexts (GTC) which represent the contexts from the whole video. As for LTC, it includes static and motional contexts, corresponding to static and moving content in neighboring frames, respectively. Previously, both static and motional contexts have been studied. However, there is no research about simultaneously learning static and motional contexts (highly complementary). Hence, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM) technique to learn a unified presentation of LTC. CFFM contains two parts: Coarse-to-Fine Feature Assembling (CFFA) and Cross-frame Feature Mining (CFM). CFFA abstracts static and motional contexts, and CFM mines useful information from nearby frames to enhance target features. To further exploit more temporal contexts, we propose CFFM++ by additionally learning GTC from the whole video. Specifically, we uniformly sample certain frames from the video and extract global contextual prototypes by k-means. The information within those prototypes is mined by CFM to refine target features. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that CFFM and CFFM++ perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/GuoleiSun/VSS-CFFM"
2204.03359,ECCV Caption: Correcting False Negatives by Collecting   Machine-and-Human-verified Image-Caption Associations for MS-COCO,"Image-Text matching (ITM) is a common task for evaluating the quality of Vision and Language (VL) models. However, existing ITM benchmarks have a significant limitation. They have many missing correspondences, originating from the data construction process itself. For example, a caption is only matched with one image although the caption can be matched with other similar images and vice versa. To correct the massive false negatives, we construct the Extended COCO Validation (ECCV) Caption dataset by supplying the missing associations with machine and human annotators. We employ five state-of-the-art ITM models with diverse properties for our annotation process. Our dataset provides x3.6 positive image-to-caption associations and x8.5 caption-to-image associations compared to the original MS-COCO. We also propose to use an informative ranking-based metric mAP@R, rather than the popular Recall@K (R@K). We re-evaluate the existing 25 VL models on existing and proposed benchmarks. Our findings are that the existing benchmarks, such as COCO 1K R@K, COCO 5K R@K, CxC R@1 are highly correlated with each other, while the rankings change when we shift to the ECCV mAP@R. Lastly, we delve into the effect of the bias introduced by the choice of machine annotator. Source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/eccv-caption"
2204.03688,"DAD-3DHeads: A Large-scale Dense, Accurate and Diverse Dataset for 3D Head Alignment from a Single Image","We present DAD-3DHeads, a dense and diverse large-scale dataset, and a robust model for 3D Dense Head Alignment in the wild. It contains annotations of over 3.5K landmarks that accurately represent 3D head shape compared to the ground-truth scans. The data-driven model, DAD-3DNet, trained on our dataset, learns shape, expression, and pose parameters, and performs 3D reconstruction of a FLAME mesh. The model also incorporates a landmark prediction branch to take advantage of rich supervision and co-training of multiple related tasks. Experimentally, DAD-3DNet outperforms or is comparable to the state-of-the-art models in (i) 3D Head Pose Estimation on AFLW2000-3D and BIWI, (ii) 3D Face Shape Reconstruction on NoW and Feng, and (iii) 3D Dense Head Alignment and 3D Landmarks Estimation on DAD-3DHeads dataset. Finally, the diversity of DAD-3DHeads in camera angles, facial expressions, and occlusions enables a benchmark to study in-the-wild generalization and robustness to distribution shifts.

2204.03772,"Multi-objective optimization determines when, which and how to fuse deep   networks: an application to predict COVID-19 outcomes","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of cases and deaths and the AI-related scientific community, after being involved with detecting COVID-19 signs in medical images, has been now directing the efforts towards the development of methods that can predict the progression of the disease. This task is multimodal by its very nature and, recently, baseline results achieved on the publicly available AIforCOVID dataset have shown that chest X-ray scans and clinical information are useful to identify patients at risk of severe outcomes. While deep learning has shown superior performance in several medical fields, in most of the cases it considers unimodal data only. In this respect, when, which and how to fuse the different modalities is an open challenge in multimodal deep learning. To cope with these three questions here we present a novel approach optimizing the setup of a multimodal end-to-end model. It exploits Pareto multi-objective optimization working with a performance metric and the diversity score of multiple candidate unimodal neural networks to be fused. We test our method on the AIforCOVID dataset, attaining state-of-the-art results, not only outperforming the baseline performance but also being robust to external validation. Moreover, exploiting XAI algorithms we figure out a hierarchy among the modalities and we extract the features' intra-modality importance, enriching the trust on the predictions made by the model."
2204.03842,From 2D Images to 3D Model:Weakly Supervised Multi-View Face   Reconstruction with Deep Fusion,"While weakly supervised multi-view face reconstruction (MVR) is garnering increased attention, one critical issue still remains open: how to effectively interact and fuse multiple image information to reconstruct high-precision 3D models. In this regard, we propose a novel pipeline called Deep Fusion MVR (DF-MVR) to explore the feature correspondences between multi-view images and reconstruct high-precision 3D faces. Specifically, we present a novel multi-view feature fusion backbone that utilizes face masks to align features from multiple encoders and integrates one multi-layer attention mechanism to enhance feature interaction and fusion, resulting in one unified facial representation. Additionally, we develop one concise face mask mechanism that facilitates multi-view feature fusion and facial reconstruction by identifying common areas and guiding the network's focus on critical facial features (e.g., eyes, brows, nose, and mouth). Experiments on Pixel-Face and Bosphorus datasets indicate the superiority of our model. Without 3D annotation, DF-MVR achieves 5.2% and 3.0% RMSE improvement over the existing weakly supervised MVRs respectively on Pixel-Face and Bosphorus dataset. Code will be available publicly at https://github.com/weiguangzhao/DF_MVR."
2204.04236,ChildCI Framework: Analysis of Motor and Cognitive Development in   Children-Computer Interaction for Age Detection,"This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the different tests proposed in the recent ChildCI framework, proving its potential for generating a better understanding of children's neuromotor and cognitive development along time, as well as their possible application in other research areas such as e-Health and e-Learning. In particular, we propose a set of over 100 global features related to motor and cognitive aspects of the children interaction with mobile devices, some of them collected and adapted from the literature.   Furthermore, we analyse the robustness and discriminative power of the proposed feature set including experimental results for the task of children age group detection based on their motor and cognitive behaviours. Two different scenarios are considered in this study: i) single-test scenario, and ii) multiple-test scenario. Results over 93% accuracy are achieved using the publicly available ChildCIdb_v1 database (over 400 children from 18 months to 8 years old), proving the high correlation of children's age with the way they interact with mobile devices."
2204.04238,Elastic shape analysis of surfaces with second-order Sobolev metrics: a   comprehensive numerical framework,"This paper introduces a set of numerical methods for Riemannian shape analysis of 3D surfaces within the setting of invariant (elastic) second-order Sobolev metrics. More specifically, we address the computation of geodesics and geodesic distances between parametrized or unparametrized immersed surfaces represented as 3D meshes. Building on this, we develop tools for the statistical shape analysis of sets of surfaces, including methods for estimating Karcher means and performing tangent PCA on shape populations, and for computing parallel transport along paths of surfaces. Our proposed approach fundamentally relies on a relaxed variational formulation for the geodesic matching problem via the use of varifold fidelity terms, which enable us to enforce reparametrization independence when computing geodesics between unparametrized surfaces, while also yielding versatile algorithms that allow us to compare surfaces with varying sampling or mesh structures. Importantly, we demonstrate how our relaxed variational framework can be extended to tackle partially observed data. The different benefits of our numerical pipeline are illustrated over various examples, synthetic and real."
2204.04377,Robotic Surgery Remote Mentoring via AR with 3D Scene Streaming and Hand   Interaction,"With the growing popularity of robotic surgery, education becomes increasingly important and urgently needed for the sake of patient safety. However, experienced surgeons have limited accessibility due to their busy clinical schedule or working in a distant city, thus can hardly provide sufficient education resources for novices. Remote mentoring, as an effective way, can help solve this problem, but traditional methods are limited to plain text, audio, or 2D video, which are not intuitive nor vivid. Augmented reality (AR), a thriving technique being widely used for various education scenarios, is promising to offer new possibilities of visual experience and interactive teaching. In this paper, we propose a novel AR-based robotic surgery remote mentoring system with efficient 3D scene visualization and natural 3D hand interaction. Using a head-mounted display (i.e., HoloLens), the mentor can remotely monitor the procedure streamed from the trainee's operation side. The mentor can also provide feedback directly with hand gestures, which is in-turn transmitted to the trainee and viewed in surgical console as guidance. We comprehensively validate the system on both real surgery stereo videos and ex-vivo scenarios of common robotic training tasks (i.e., peg-transfer and suturing). Promising results are demonstrated regarding the fidelity of streamed scene visualization, the accuracy of feedback with hand interaction, and the low-latency of each component in the entire remote mentoring system. This work showcases the feasibility of leveraging AR technology for reliable, flexible and low-cost solutions to robotic surgical education, and holds great potential for clinical applications."
2204.04681,Adaptive Channel Allocation for Robust Differentiable Architecture   Search,"Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and significant improvement in efficiency. However, the excessive accumulation of the skip connection, when training epochs become large, makes it suffer from weak stability and low robustness, thus limiting its practical applications. Many works have attempted to restrict the accumulation of skip connections by indicators or manual design. These methods, however, are susceptible to human priors and hyper-parameters. In this work, we suggest a more subtle and direct approach that no longer explicitly searches for skip connections in the search stage, based on the paradox that skip connections were proposed to guarantee the performance of very deep networks, but the networks in the search stage of differentiable architecture search are actually very shallow. Instead, by introducing channel importance ranking and channel allocation strategy, the skip connections are implicitly searched and automatically refilled unimportant channels in the evaluation stage. Our method, dubbed Adaptive Channel Allocation (ACA) strategy, is a general-purpose approach for differentiable architecture search, which universally works in DARTS variants without introducing human priors, indicators, or hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on various datasets and DARTS variants verify that the ACA strategy is the most effective one among existing methods in improving robustness and dealing with the collapse issue when training epochs become large."
2204.04730,Deep Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion: A Sequence-to-Sequence Translation   Perspective,"Directly regressing the non-rigid shape and camera pose from the individual 2D frame is ill-suited to the Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) problem. This frame-by-frame 3D reconstruction pipeline overlooks the inherent spatial-temporal nature of NRSfM, i.e., reconstructing the whole 3D sequence from the input 2D sequence. In this paper, we propose to model deep NRSfM from a sequence-to-sequence translation perspective, where the input 2D frame sequence is taken as a whole to reconstruct the deforming 3D non-rigid shape sequence. First, we apply a shape-motion predictor to estimate the initial non-rigid shape and camera motion from a single frame. Then we propose a context modeling module to model camera motions and complex non-rigid shapes. To tackle the difficulty in enforcing the global structure constraint within the deep framework, we propose to impose the union-of-subspace structure by replacing the self-expressiveness layer with multi-head attention and delayed regularizers, which enables end-to-end batch-wise training. Experimental results across different datasets such as Human3.6M, CMU Mocap and InterHand prove the superiority of our framework."
2204.05172,Event Transformer,"The event camera's low power consumption and ability to capture microsecond brightness changes make it attractive for various computer vision tasks. Existing event representation methods typically convert events into frames, voxel grids, or spikes for deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these approaches often sacrifice temporal granularity or require specialized devices for processing. This work introduces a novel token-based event representation, where each event is considered a fundamental processing unit termed an event-token. This approach preserves the sequence's intricate spatiotemporal attributes at the event level. Moreover, we propose a Three-way Attention mechanism in the Event Transformer Block (ETB) to collaboratively construct temporal and spatial correlations between events. We compare our proposed token-based event representation extensively with other prevalent methods for object classification and optical flow estimation. The experimental results showcase its competitive performance while demanding minimal computational resources on standard devices. Our code is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/NJUVISION/EventTransformer}."
2204.05566,Compact Model Training by Low-Rank Projection with Energy Transfer,"Low-rankness plays an important role in traditional machine learning, but is not so popular in deep learning. Most previous low-rank network compression methods compress networks by approximating pre-trained models and re-training. However, the optimal solution in the Euclidean space may be quite different from the one with low-rank constraint. A well-pre-trained model is not a good initialization for the model with low-rank constraints. Thus, the performance of a low-rank compressed network degrades significantly. Compared with other network compression methods such as pruning, low-rank methods attract less attention in recent years. In this paper, we devise a new training method, low-rank projection with energy transfer (LRPET), that trains low-rank compressed networks from scratch and achieves competitive performance. We propose to alternately perform stochastic gradient descent training and projection of each weight matrix onto the corresponding low-rank manifold. Compared to re-training on the compact model, this enables full utilization of model capacity since solution space is relaxed back to Euclidean space after projection. The matrix energy (the sum of squares of singular values) reduction caused by projection is compensated by energy transfer. We uniformly transfer the energy of the pruned singular values to the remaining ones. We theoretically show that energy transfer eases the trend of gradient vanishing caused by projection. In modern networks, a batch normalization (BN) layer can be merged into the previous convolution layer for inference, thereby influencing the optimal low-rank approximation of the previous layer. We propose BN rectification to cut off its effect on the optimal low-rank approximation, which further improves the performance."
2204.05798,Multi-View Hypercomplex Learning for Breast Cancer Screening,"Traditionally, deep learning methods for breast cancer classification perform a single-view analysis. However, radiologists simultaneously analyze all four views that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations contained in mammography views, which present crucial information for identifying tumors. In light of this, some studies have started to propose multi-view methods. Nevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram views are processed as independent images by separate convolutional branches, thus losing correlations among them. To overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose a methodological approach for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex algebra properties, our networks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing correlations between the different views that comprise a mammogram, thus mimicking the reading process performed by clinicians. This happens because hypercomplex networks capture both global properties, as standard neural models, as well as local relations, i.e., inter-view correlations, which real-valued networks fail at modeling. We define architectures designed to process two-view exams, namely PHResNets, and four-view exams, i.e., PHYSEnet and PHYBOnet. Through an extensive experimental evaluation conducted with publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed models clearly outperform real-valued counterparts and state-of-the-art methods, proving that breast cancer classification benefits from the proposed multi-view architectures. We also assess the method generalizability beyond mammogram analysis by considering different benchmarks, as well as a finer-scaled task such as segmentation. Full code and pretrained models for complete reproducibility of our experiments are freely available at https://github.com/ispamm/PHBreast."
2204.05983,Comparison Analysis of Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning   Techniques for Data and Image Classification,"The purpose of the study is to analyse and compare the most common machine learning and deep learning techniques used for computer vision 2D object classification tasks. Firstly, we will present the theoretical background of the Bag of Visual words model and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). Secondly, we will implement a Bag of Visual Words model, the VGG16 CNN Architecture. Thirdly, we will present our custom and novice DCNN in which we test the aforementioned implementations on a modified version of the Belgium Traffic Sign dataset. Our results showcase the effects of hyperparameters on traditional machine learning and the advantage in terms of accuracy of DCNNs compared to classical machine learning methods. As our tests indicate, our proposed solution can achieve similar - and in some cases better - results than existing DCNNs architectures. Finally, the technical merit of this article lies in the presented computationally simpler DCNN architecture, which we believe can pave the way towards using more efficient architectures for basic tasks."
2204.05986,Machine Learning Security against Data Poisoning: Are We There Yet?,"The recent success of machine learning (ML) has been fueled by the increasing availability of computing power and large amounts of data in many different applications. However, the trustworthiness of the resulting models can be compromised when such data is maliciously manipulated to mislead the learning process. In this article, we first review poisoning attacks that compromise the training data used to learn ML models, including attacks that aim to reduce the overall performance, manipulate the predictions on specific test samples, and even implant backdoors in the model. We then discuss how to mitigate these attacks using basic security principles, or by deploying ML-oriented defensive mechanisms. We conclude our article by formulating some relevant open challenges which are hindering the development of testing methods and benchmarks suitable for assessing and improving the trustworthiness of ML models against data poisoning attacks"
2204.06859,Semi-Supervised Training to Improve Player and Ball Detection in Soccer,"Accurate player and ball detection has become increasingly important in recent years for sport analytics. As most state-of-the-art methods rely on training deep learning networks in a supervised fashion, they require huge amounts of annotated data, which are rarely available. In this paper, we present a novel generic semi-supervised method to train a network based on a labeled image dataset by leveraging a large unlabeled dataset of soccer broadcast videos. More precisely, we design a teacher-student approach in which the teacher produces surrogate annotations on the unlabeled data to be used later for training a student which has the same architecture as the teacher. Furthermore, we introduce three training loss parametrizations that allow the student to doubt the predictions of the teacher during training depending on the proposal confidence score. We show that including unlabeled data in the training process allows to substantially improve the performances of the detection network trained only on the labeled data. Finally, we provide a thorough performance study including different proportions of labeled and unlabeled data, and establish the first benchmark on the new SoccerNet-v3 detection task, with an mAP of 52.3%. Our code is available at https://github.com/rvandeghen/SST ."
2204.06862,An Identity-Preserved Framework for Human Motion Transfer,"Human motion transfer (HMT) aims to generate a video clip for the target subject by imitating the source subject's motion. Although previous methods have achieved good results in synthesizing good-quality videos, they lose sight of individualized motion information from the source and target motions, which is significant for the realism of the motion in the generated video. To address this problem, we propose a novel identity-preserved HMT network, termed \textit{IDPres}. This network is a skeleton-based approach that uniquely incorporates the target's individualized motion and skeleton information to augment identity representations. This integration significantly enhances the realism of movements in the generated videos. Our method focuses on the fine-grained disentanglement and synthesis of motion. To improve the representation learning capability in latent space and facilitate the training of \textit{IDPres}, we introduce three training schemes. These schemes enable \textit{IDPres} to concurrently disentangle different representations and accurately control them, ensuring the synthesis of ideal motions. To evaluate the proportion of individualized motion information in the generated video, we are the first to introduce a new quantitative metric called Identity Score (\textit{ID-Score}), motivated by the success of gait recognition methods in capturing identity information. Moreover, we collect an identity-motion paired dataset, $Dancer101$, consisting of solo-dance videos of 101 subjects from the public domain, providing a benchmark to prompt the development of HMT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed \textit{IDPres} method surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of reconstruction accuracy, realistic motion, and identity preservation."
2204.06918,SoccerNet-Tracking: Multiple Object Tracking Dataset and Benchmark in   Soccer Videos,"Tracking objects in soccer videos is extremely important to gather both player and team statistics, whether it is to estimate the total distance run, the ball possession or the team formation. Video processing can help automating the extraction of those information, without the need of any invasive sensor, hence applicable to any team on any stadium. Yet, the availability of datasets to train learnable models and benchmarks to evaluate methods on a common testbed is very limited. In this work, we propose a novel dataset for multiple object tracking composed of 200 sequences of 30s each, representative of challenging soccer scenarios, and a complete 45-minutes half-time for long-term tracking. The dataset is fully annotated with bounding boxes and tracklet IDs, enabling the training of MOT baselines in the soccer domain and a full benchmarking of those methods on our segregated challenge sets. Our analysis shows that multiple player, referee and ball tracking in soccer videos is far from being solved, with several improvement required in case of fast motion or in scenarios of severe occlusion."
2204.07126,GIFS: Neural Implicit Function for General Shape Representation,"Recent development of neural implicit function has shown tremendous success on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction. However, most works divide the space into inside and outside of the shape, which limits their representing power to single-layer and watertight shapes. This limitation leads to tedious data processing (converting non-watertight raw data to watertight) as well as the incapability of representing general object shapes in the real world. In this work, we propose a novel method to represent general shapes including non-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces. We introduce General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS), which models the relationships between every two points instead of the relationships between points and surfaces. Instead of dividing 3D space into predefined inside-outside regions, GIFS encodes whether two points are separated by any surface. Experiments on ShapeNet show that GIFS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality, rendering efficiency, and visual fidelity. Project page is available at https://jianglongye.com/gifs ."
2204.07636,Lagrangian Motion Magnification with Double Sparse Optical Flow   Decomposition,"Microexpressions are fast and spatially small facial expressions that are difficult to detect. Therefore motion magnification techniques, which aim at amplifying and hence revealing subtle motion in videos, appear useful for handling such expressions. There are basically two main approaches, namely via Eulerian or Lagrangian techniques. While the first one magnifies motion implicitly by operating directly on image pixels, the Lagrangian approach uses optical flow (OF) techniques to extract and magnify pixel trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for local Lagrangian motion magnification of facial micro-motions. Our contribution is three-fold: first, we fine tune the recurrent all-pairs field transforms (RAFT) for OFs deep learning approach for faces by adding ground truth obtained from the variational dense inverse search (DIS) for OF algorithm applied to the CASME II video set of facial micro expressions. This enables us to produce OFs of facial videos in an efficient and sufficiently accurate way. Second, since facial micro-motions are both local in space and time, we propose to approximate the OF field by sparse components both in space and time leading to a double sparse decomposition. Third, we use this decomposition to magnify micro-motions in specific areas of the face, where we introduce a new forward warping strategy using a triangular splitting of the image grid and barycentric interpolation of the RGB vectors at the corners of the transformed triangles. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by various examples."
2204.07640,Event-aided Direct Sparse Odometry,"We introduce EDS, a direct monocular visual odometry using events and frames. Our algorithm leverages the event generation model to track the camera motion in the blind time between frames. The method formulates a direct probabilistic approach of observed brightness increments. Per-pixel brightness increments are predicted using a sparse number of selected 3D points and are compared to the events via the brightness increment error to estimate camera motion. The method recovers a semi-dense 3D map using photometric bundle adjustment. EDS is the first method to perform 6-DOF VO using events and frames with a direct approach. By design, it overcomes the problem of changing appearance in indirect methods. We also show that, for a target error performance, EDS can work at lower frame rates than state-of-the-art frame-based VO solutions. This opens the door to low-power motion-tracking applications where frames are sparingly triggered ""on demand"" and our method tracks the motion in between. We release code and datasets to the public."
2204.07756,Visual Attention Methods in Deep Learning: An In-Depth Survey,"Inspired by the human cognitive system, attention is a mechanism that imitates the human cognitive awareness about specific information, amplifying critical details to focus more on the essential aspects of data. Deep learning has employed attention to boost performance for many applications. Interestingly, the same attention design can suit processing different data modalities and can easily be incorporated into large networks. Furthermore, multiple complementary attention mechanisms can be incorporated into one network. Hence, attention techniques have become extremely attractive. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey on attention techniques to guide researchers in employing attention in their deep models. Note that, besides being demanding in terms of training data and computational resources, transformers only cover a single category in self-attention out of the many categories available. We fill this gap and provide an in-depth survey of 50 attention techniques, categorizing them by their most prominent features. We initiate our discussion by introducing the fundamental concepts behind the success of the attention mechanism. Next, we furnish some essentials such as the strengths and limitations of each attention category, describe their fundamental building blocks, basic formulations with primary usage, and applications specifically for computer vision. We also discuss the challenges and general open questions related to attention mechanisms. Finally, we recommend possible future research directions for deep attention. All the information about visual attention methods in deep learning is provided at \href{https://github.com/saeed-anwar/VisualAttention}{https://github.com/saeed-anwar/VisualAttention}"
2204.07935,Causal Intervention for Subject-Deconfounded Facial Action Unit   Recognition,"Subject-invariant facial action unit (AU) recognition remains challenging for the reason that the data distribution varies among subjects. In this paper, we propose a causal inference framework for subject-invariant facial action unit recognition. To illustrate the causal effect existing in AU recognition task, we formulate the causalities among facial images, subjects, latent AU semantic relations, and estimated AU occurrence probabilities via a structural causal model. By constructing such a causal diagram, we clarify the causal effect among variables and propose a plug-in causal intervention module, CIS, to deconfound the confounder \emph{Subject} in the causal diagram. Extensive experiments conducted on two commonly used AU benchmark datasets, BP4D and DISFA, show the effectiveness of our CIS, and the model with CIS inserted, CISNet, has achieved state-of-the-art performance."
2204.08027,Attention Mechanism based Cognition-level Scene Understanding,"Given a question-image input, the Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) model can predict an answer with the corresponding rationale, which requires inference ability from the real world. The VCR task, which calls for exploiting the multi-source information as well as learning different levels of understanding and extensive commonsense knowledge, is a cognition-level scene understanding task. The VCR task has aroused researchers' interest due to its wide range of applications, including visual question answering, automated vehicle systems, and clinical decision support. Previous approaches to solving the VCR task generally rely on pre-training or exploiting memory with long dependency relationship encoded models. However, these approaches suffer from a lack of generalizability and losing information in long sequences. In this paper, we propose a parallel attention-based cognitive VCR network PAVCR, which fuses visual-textual information efficiently and encodes semantic information in parallel to enable the model to capture rich information for cognition-level inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model yields significant improvements over existing methods on the benchmark VCR dataset. Moreover, the proposed model provides intuitive interpretation into visual commonsense reasoning."
2204.08381,Multiple-environment Self-adaptive Network for Aerial-view   Geo-localization,"Aerial-view geo-localization tends to determine an unknown position through matching the drone-view image with the geo-tagged satellite-view image. This task is mostly regarded as an image retrieval problem. The key underpinning this task is to design a series of deep neural networks to learn discriminative image descriptors. However, existing methods meet large performance drops under realistic weather, such as rain and fog, since they do not take the domain shift between the training data and multiple test environments into consideration. To minor this domain gap, we propose a Multiple-environment Self-adaptive Network (MuSe-Net) to dynamically adjust the domain shift caused by environmental changing. In particular, MuSe-Net employs a two-branch neural network containing one multiple-environment style extraction network and one self-adaptive feature extraction network. As the name implies, the multiple-environment style extraction network is to extract the environment-related style information, while the self-adaptive feature extraction network utilizes an adaptive modulation module to dynamically minimize the environment-related style gap. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmarks, i.e., University-1652 and CVUSA, demonstrate that the proposed MuSe-Net achieves a competitive result for geo-localization in multiple environments. Furthermore, we observe that the proposed method also shows great potential to the unseen extreme weather, such as mixing the fog, rain and snow."
2204.08502,Spot the Difference: A Novel Task for Embodied Agents in Changing   Environments,"Embodied AI is a recent research area that aims at creating intelligent agents that can move and operate inside an environment. Existing approaches in this field demand the agents to act in completely new and unexplored scenes. However, this setting is far from realistic use cases that instead require executing multiple tasks in the same environment. Even if the environment changes over time, the agent could still count on its global knowledge about the scene while trying to adapt its internal representation to the current state of the environment. To make a step towards this setting, we propose Spot the Difference: a novel task for Embodied AI where the agent has access to an outdated map of the environment and needs to recover the correct layout in a fixed time budget. To this end, we collect a new dataset of occupancy maps starting from existing datasets of 3D spaces and generating a number of possible layouts for a single environment. This dataset can be employed in the popular Habitat simulator and is fully compliant with existing methods that employ reconstructed occupancy maps during navigation. Furthermore, we propose an exploration policy that can take advantage of previous knowledge of the environment and identify changes in the scene faster and more effectively than existing agents. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for exploration on this new setting."
2204.08989,Efficient Deep Learning-based Estimation of the Vital Signs on   Smartphones,"With the increasing use of smartphones in our daily lives, these devices have become capable of performing many complex tasks. Concerning the need for continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially for the elderly or those with certain types of diseases, the development of algorithms that can estimate vital signs using smartphones has attracted researchers worldwide. In particular, researchers have been exploring ways to estimate vital signs, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation levels, and respiratory rate, using algorithms that can be run on smartphones. However, many of these algorithms require multiple pre-processing steps that might introduce some implementation overheads or require the design of a couple of hand-crafted stages to obtain an optimal result. To address this issue, this research proposes a novel end-to-end solution to mobile-based vital sign estimation using deep learning that eliminates the need for pre-processing. By using a fully convolutional architecture, the proposed model has much fewer parameters and less computational complexity compared to the architectures that use fully-connected layers as the prediction heads. This also reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, a public dataset for vital sign estimation, which includes 62 videos collected from 35 men and 27 women, is provided. Overall, the proposed end-to-end approach promises significantly improved efficiency and performance for on-device health monitoring on readily available consumer electronics."
2204.09069,Embodied Navigation at the Art Gallery,"Embodied agents, trained to explore and navigate indoor photorealistic environments, have achieved impressive results on standard datasets and benchmarks. So far, experiments and evaluations have involved domestic and working scenes like offices, flats, and houses. In this paper, we build and release a new 3D space with unique characteristics: the one of a complete art museum. We name this environment ArtGallery3D (AG3D). Compared with existing 3D scenes, the collected space is ampler, richer in visual features, and provides very sparse occupancy information. This feature is challenging for occupancy-based agents which are usually trained in crowded domestic environments with plenty of occupancy information. Additionally, we annotate the coordinates of the main points of interest inside the museum, such as paintings, statues, and other items. Thanks to this manual process, we deliver a new benchmark for PointGoal navigation inside this new space. Trajectories in this dataset are far more complex and lengthy than existing ground-truth paths for navigation in Gibson and Matterport3D. We carry on extensive experimental evaluation using our new space for evaluation and prove that existing methods hardly adapt to this scenario. As such, we believe that the availability of this 3D model will foster future research and help improve existing solutions."
2204.09344,Cyber-Forensic Review of Human Footprint and Gait for Personal   Identification,"The human footprint is having a unique set of ridges unmatched by any other human being, and therefore it can be used in different identity documents for example birth certificate, Indian biometric identification system AADHAR card, driving license, PAN card, and passport. There are many instances of the crime scene where an accused must walk around and left the footwear impressions as well as barefoot prints and therefore, it is very crucial to recovering the footprints from identifying the criminals. Footprint-based biometric is a considerably newer technique for personal identification. Fingerprints, retina, iris and face recognition are the methods most useful for attendance record of the person. This time the world is facing the problem of global terrorism. It is challenging to identify the terrorist because they are living as regular as the citizens do. Their soft target includes the industries of special interests such as defence, silicon and nanotechnology chip manufacturing units, pharmacy sectors. They pretend themselves as religious persons, so temples and other holy places, even in markets is in their targets. These are the places where one can obtain their footprints quickly. The gait itself is sufficient to predict the behaviour of the suspects. The present research is driven to identify the usefulness of footprint and gait as an alternative to personal identification."
2204.09389,Epistemic Uncertainty-Weighted Loss for Visual Bias Mitigation,"Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to learning biases in visual data. While various methods have been proposed to mitigate such bias, the majority require explicit knowledge of the biases present in the training data in order to mitigate. We argue the relevance of exploring methods which are completely ignorant of the presence of any bias, but are capable of identifying and mitigating them. Furthermore, we propose using Bayesian neural networks with a predictive uncertainty-weighted loss function to dynamically identify potential bias in individual training samples and to weight them during training. We find a positive correlation between samples subject to bias and higher epistemic uncertainties. Finally, we show the method has potential to mitigate visual bias on a bias benchmark dataset and on a real-world face detection problem, and we consider the merits and weaknesses of our approach."
2204.09556,De-biasing facial detection system using VAE,"Bias in AI/ML-based systems is a ubiquitous problem and bias in AI/ML systems may negatively impact society. There are many reasons behind a system being biased. The bias can be due to the algorithm we are using for our problem or may be due to the dataset we are using, having some features over-represented in it. In the face detection system bias due to the dataset is majorly seen. Sometimes models learn only features that are over-represented in data and ignore rare features from data which results in being biased toward those over-represented features. In real life, these biased systems are dangerous to society. The proposed approach uses generative models which are best suited for learning underlying features(latent variables) from the dataset and by using these learned features models try to reduce the threats which are there due to bias in the system. With the help of an algorithm, the bias present in the dataset can be removed. And then we train models on two datasets and compare the results."
2204.09804,Weighted Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model for Roadside LiDAR Object   Detection,"Background modeling is widely used for intelligent surveillance systems to detect moving targets by subtracting the static background components. Most roadside LiDAR object detection methods filter out foreground points by comparing new data points to pre-trained background references based on descriptive statistics over many frames (e.g., voxel density, number of neighbors, maximum distance). However, these solutions are inefficient under heavy traffic, and parameter values are hard to transfer from one scenario to another. In early studies, the probabilistic background modeling methods widely used for the video-based system were considered unsuitable for roadside LiDAR surveillance systems due to the sparse and unstructured point cloud data. In this paper, the raw LiDAR data were transformed into a structured representation based on the elevation and azimuth value of each LiDAR point. With this high-order tensor representation, we break the barrier to allow efficient high-dimensional multivariate analysis for roadside LiDAR background modeling. The Bayesian Nonparametric (BNP) approach integrates the intensity value and 3D measurements to exploit the measurement data using 3D and intensity info entirely. The proposed method was compared against two state-of-the-art roadside LiDAR background models, computer vision benchmark, and deep learning baselines, evaluated at point, object, and path levels under heavy traffic and challenging weather. This multimodal Weighted Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) can handle dynamic backgrounds with noisy measurements and substantially enhances the infrastructure-based LiDAR object detection, whereby various 3D modeling for smart city applications could be created."
2204.09815,Parametric Level-sets Enhanced To Improve Reconstruction (PaLEnTIR),"We introduce PaLEnTIR, a significantly enhanced parametric level-set (PaLS) method addressing the restoration and reconstruction of piecewise constant objects. Our key contribution involves a unique PaLS formulation utilizing a single level-set function to restore scenes containing multi-contrast piecewise-constant objects without requiring knowledge of the number of objects or their contrasts. Unlike standard PaLS methods employing radial basis functions (RBFs), our model integrates anisotropic basis functions (ABFs), thereby expanding its capacity to represent a wider class of shapes. Furthermore, PaLEnTIR improves the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix, required as part of the parameter identification process, and consequently accelerates optimization methods. We validate PaLEnTIR's efficacy through diverse experiments encompassing sparse and limited angle of view X-ray computed tomography (2D and 3D), nonlinear diffuse optical tomography (DOT), denoising, and deconvolution tasks using both real and simulated data sets."
2204.09957,Self-paced Multi-grained Cross-modal Interaction Modeling for Referring   Expression Comprehension,"As an important and challenging problem in vision-language tasks, referring expression comprehension (REC) generally requires a large amount of multi-grained information of visual and linguistic modalities to realize accurate reasoning. In addition, due to the diversity of visual scenes and the variation of linguistic expressions, some hard examples have much more abundant multi-grained information than others. How to aggregate multi-grained information from different modalities and extract abundant knowledge from hard examples is crucial in the REC task. To address aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a Self-paced Multi-grained Cross-modal Interaction Modeling framework, which improves the language-to-vision localization ability through innovations in network structure and learning mechanism. Concretely, we design a transformer-based multi-grained cross-modal attention, which effectively utilizes the inherent multi-grained information in visual and linguistic encoders. Furthermore, considering the large variance of samples, we propose a self-paced sample informativeness learning to adaptively enhance the network learning for samples containing abundant multi-grained information. The proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely used datasets, such as RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReferItGame datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."
2204.10109,Deep Model-Based Super-Resolution with Non-uniform Blur,"We propose a state-of-the-art method for super-resolution with non-uniform blur. Single-image super-resolution methods seek to restore a high-resolution image from blurred, subsampled, and noisy measurements. Despite their impressive performance, existing techniques usually assume a uniform blur kernel. Hence, these techniques do not generalize well to the more general case of non-uniform blur. Instead, in this paper, we address the more realistic and computationally challenging case of spatially-varying blur. To this end, we first propose a fast deep plug-and-play algorithm, based on linearized ADMM splitting techniques, which can solve the super-resolution problem with spatially-varying blur. Second, we unfold our iterative algorithm into a single network and train it end-to-end. In this way, we overcome the intricacy of manually tuning the parameters involved in the optimization scheme. Our algorithm presents remarkable performance and generalizes well after a single training to a large family of spatially-varying blur kernels, noise levels and scale factors."
2204.10713,EmbedTrack -- Simultaneous Cell Segmentation and Tracking Through   Learning Offsets and Clustering Bandwidths,"A systematic analysis of the cell behavior requires automated approaches for cell segmentation and tracking. While deep learning has been successfully applied for the task of cell segmentation, there are few approaches for simultaneous cell segmentation and tracking using deep learning. Here, we present EmbedTrack, a single convolutional neural network for simultaneous cell segmentation and tracking which predicts easy to interpret embeddings. As embeddings, offsets of cell pixels to their cell center and bandwidths are learned. We benchmark our approach on nine 2D data sets from the Cell Tracking Challenge, where our approach performs on seven out of nine data sets within the top 3 contestants including three top 1 performances. The source code is publicly available at https://git.scc.kit.edu/kit-loe-ge/embedtrack."
2204.10762,Dite-HRNet: Dynamic Lightweight High-Resolution Network for Human Pose   Estimation,"A high-resolution network exhibits remarkable capability in extracting multi-scale features for human pose estimation, but fails to capture long-range interactions between joints and has high computational complexity. To address these problems, we present a Dynamic lightweight High-Resolution Network (Dite-HRNet), which can efficiently extract multi-scale contextual information and model long-range spatial dependency for human pose estimation. Specifically, we propose two methods, dynamic split convolution and adaptive context modeling, and embed them into two novel lightweight blocks, which are named dynamic multi-scale context block and dynamic global context block. These two blocks, as the basic component units of our Dite-HRNet, are specially designed for the high-resolution networks to make full use of the parallel multi-resolution architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed network achieves superior performance on both COCO and MPII human pose estimation datasets, surpassing the state-of-the-art lightweight networks. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZiyiZhang27/Dite-HRNet."
2204.10942,Evaluation of Multi-Scale Multiple Instance Learning to Improve Thyroid   Cancer Classification,"Thyroid cancer is currently the fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women. Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores. This provides motivation for analysis and discussion of the individual approaches."
2204.10959,A benchmark dataset for deep learning-based airplane detection: HRPlanes,"Airplane detection from satellite imagery is a challenging task due to the complex backgrounds in the images and differences in data acquisition conditions caused by the sensor geometry and atmospheric effects. Deep learning methods provide reliable and accurate solutions for automatic detection of airplanes; however, huge amount of training data is required to obtain promising results. In this study, we create a novel airplane detection dataset called High Resolution Planes (HRPlanes) by using images from Google Earth (GE) and labeling the bounding box of each plane on the images. HRPlanes include GE images of several different airports across the world to represent a variety of landscape, seasonal and satellite geometry conditions obtained from different satellites. We evaluated our dataset with two widely used object detection methods namely YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN. Our preliminary results show that the proposed dataset can be a valuable data source and benchmark data set for future applications. Moreover, proposed architectures and results of this study could be used for transfer learning of different datasets and models for airplane detection."
2204.10993,TerrainMesh: Metric-Semantic Terrain Reconstruction from Aerial Images   Using Joint 2D-3D Learning,"This paper considers outdoor terrain mapping using RGB images obtained from an aerial vehicle. While feature-based localization and mapping techniques deliver real-time vehicle odometry and sparse keypoint depth reconstruction, a dense model of the environment geometry and semantics (vegetation, buildings, etc.) is usually recovered offline with significant computation and storage. This paper develops a joint 2D-3D learning approach to reconstruct a local metric-semantic mesh at each camera keyframe maintained by a visual odometry algorithm. Given the estimated camera trajectory, the local meshes can be assembled into a global environment model to capture the terrain topology and semantics during online operation. A local mesh is reconstructed using an initialization and refinement stage. In the initialization stage, we estimate the mesh vertex elevation by solving a least squares problem relating the vertex barycentric coordinates to the sparse keypoint depth measurements. In the refinement stage, we associate 2D image and semantic features with the 3D mesh vertices using camera projection and apply graph convolution to refine the mesh vertex spatial coordinates and semantic features based on joint 2D and 3D supervision. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation using real aerial images show the potential of our method to support environmental monitoring and surveillance applications."
2204.11041,Learning by Erasing: Conditional Entropy based Transferable   Out-Of-Distribution Detection,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to handle the distribution shifts between training and test scenarios. For a new in-distribution (ID) dataset, existing methods require retraining to capture the dataset-specific feature representation or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a deep generative models (DGM) based transferable OOD detection method, which is unnecessary to retrain on a new ID dataset. We design an image erasing strategy to equip exclusive conditional entropy distribution for each ID dataset, which determines the discrepancy of DGM's posteriori ucertainty distribution on different ID datasets. Owing to the powerful representation capacity of convolutional neural networks, the proposed model trained on complex dataset can capture the above discrepancy between ID datasets without retraining and thus achieve transferable OOD detection. We validate the proposed method on five datasets and verity that ours achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art group based OOD detection methods that need to be retrained to deploy on new ID datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/oOHCIOo/CETOOD."
2204.11143,Supplementing Missing Visions via Dialog for Scene Graph Generations,"Most current AI systems rely on the premise that the input visual data are sufficient to achieve competitive performance in various computer vision tasks. However, the classic task setup rarely considers the challenging, yet common practical situations where the complete visual data may be inaccessible due to various reasons (e.g., restricted view range and occlusions). To this end, we investigate a computer vision task setting with incomplete visual input data. Specifically, we exploit the Scene Graph Generation (SGG) task with various levels of visual data missingness as input. While insufficient visual input intuitively leads to performance drop, we propose to supplement the missing visions via the natural language dialog interactions to better accomplish the task objective. We design a model-agnostic Supplementary Interactive Dialog (SI-Dial) framework that can be jointly learned with most existing models, endowing the current AI systems with the ability of question-answer interactions in natural language. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a task setting with missing visual input and the effectiveness of our proposed dialog module as the supplementary information source through extensive experiments and analysis, by achieving promising performance improvement over multiple baselines."
2204.11146,Gabor is Enough: Interpretable Deep Denoising with a Gabor Synthesis   Dictionary Prior,"Image processing neural networks, natural and artificial, have a long history with orientation-selectivity, often described mathematically as Gabor filters. Gabor-like filters have been observed in the early layers of CNN classifiers and even throughout low-level image processing networks. In this work, we take this observation to the extreme and explicitly constrain the filters of a natural-image denoising CNN to be learned 2D real Gabor filters. Surprisingly, we find that the proposed network (GDLNet) can achieve near state-of-the-art denoising performance amongst popular fully convolutional neural networks, with only a fraction of the learned parameters. We further verify that this parameterization maintains the noise-level generalization (training vs. inference mismatch) characteristics of the base network, and investigate the contribution of individual Gabor filter parameters to the performance of the denoiser. We present positive findings for the interpretation of dictionary learning networks as performing accelerated sparse-coding via the importance of untied learned scale parameters between network layers. Our network's success suggests that representations used by low-level image processing CNNs can be as simple and interpretable as Gabor filterbanks."
2204.11444,Boosting Pruned Networks with Linear Over-parameterization,"Structured pruning compresses neural networks by reducing channels (filters) for fast inference and low footprint at run-time. To restore accuracy after pruning, fine-tuning is usually applied to pruned networks. However, too few remaining parameters in pruned networks inevitably bring a great challenge to fine-tuning to restore accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that first linearly over-parameterizes the compact layers in pruned networks to enlarge the number of fine-tuning parameters and then re-parameterizes them to the original layers after fine-tuning. Specifically, we equivalently expand the convolution/linear layer with several consecutive convolution/linear layers that do not alter the current output feature maps. Furthermore, we utilize similarity-preserving knowledge distillation that encourages the over-parameterized block to learn the immediate data-to-data similarities of the corresponding dense layer to maintain its feature learning ability. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet which significantly outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning strategy, especially for large pruning ratio."
2204.11970,Visual Acuity Prediction on Real-Life Patient Data Using a Machine   Learning Based Multistage System,"In ophthalmology, intravitreal operative medication therapy (IVOM) is a widespread treatment for diseases related to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the diabetic macular edema (DME), as well as the retinal vein occlusion (RVO). However, in real-world settings, patients often suffer from loss of vision on time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the prediction of the visual acuity (VA) and the earliest possible detection of deterioration under real-life conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous and incomplete data. In this contribution, we present a workflow for the development of a research-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of the department of ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The extensive data corpus allows predictive statements of the expected progression of a patient and his or her VA in each of the three diseases. For the disease AMD, we found out a significant deterioration of the visual acuity over time. Within our proposed multistage system, we subsequently classify the VA progression into the three groups of therapy ""winners"", ""stabilizers"", and ""losers"" (WSL classification scheme). Our OCT biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks results in a classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to complete incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a more precise VA modeling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA examinations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict the VA progression within a forecasted time frame, whereas our prediction is currently restricted to IVOM / no therapy. We achieve a final prediction accuracy of 69 % in macro average F1-score, while being in the same range as the ophthalmologists with 57.8 and 50 +- 10.7 % F1-score."
2204.12039,Learning Weighting Map for Bit-Depth Expansion within a Rational Range,"Bit-depth expansion (BDE) is one of the emerging technologies to display high bit-depth (HBD) image from low bit-depth (LBD) source. Existing BDE methods have no unified solution for various BDE situations, and directly learn a mapping for each pixel from LBD image to the desired value in HBD image, which may change the given high-order bits and lead to a huge deviation from the ground truth. In this paper, we design a bit restoration network (BRNet) to learn a weight for each pixel, which indicates the ratio of the replenished value within a rational range, invoking an accurate solution without modifying the given high-order bit information. To make the network adaptive for any bit-depth degradation, we investigate the issue in an optimization perspective and train the network under progressive training strategy for better performance. Moreover, we employ Wasserstein distance as a visual quality indicator to evaluate the difference of color distribution between restored image and the ground truth. Experimental results show our method can restore colorful images with fewer artifacts and false contours, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with higher PSNR/SSIM results and lower Wasserstein distance. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/yuqing-liu-dut/bit-depth-expansion"
2204.12077,AAU-net: An Adaptive Attention U-net for Breast Lesions Segmentation in   Ultrasound Images,"Various deep learning methods have been proposed to segment breast lesion from ultrasound images. However, similar intensity distributions, variable tumor morphology and blurred boundaries present challenges for breast lesions segmentation, especially for malignant tumors with irregular shapes. Considering the complexity of ultrasound images, we develop an adaptive attention U-net (AAU-net) to segment breast lesions automatically and stably from ultrasound images. Specifically, we introduce a hybrid adaptive attention module, which mainly consists of a channel self-attention block and a spatial self-attention block, to replace the traditional convolution operation. Compared with the conventional convolution operation, the design of the hybrid adaptive attention module can help us capture more features under different receptive fields. Different from existing attention mechanisms, the hybrid adaptive attention module can guide the network to adaptively select more robust representation in channel and space dimensions to cope with more complex breast lesions segmentation. Extensive experiments with several state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods on three public breast ultrasound datasets show that our method has better performance on breast lesion segmentation. Furthermore, robustness analysis and external experiments demonstrate that our proposed AAU-net has better generalization performance on the segmentation of breast lesions. Moreover, the hybrid adaptive attention module can be flexibly applied to existing network frameworks."
2204.12089,Acquiring a Dynamic Light Field through a Single-Shot Coded Image,"We propose a method for compressively acquiring a dynamic light field (a 5-D volume) through a single-shot coded image (a 2-D measurement). We designed an imaging model that synchronously applies aperture coding and pixel-wise exposure coding within a single exposure time. This coding scheme enables us to effectively embed the original information into a single observed image. The observed image is then fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for light-field reconstruction, which is jointly trained with the camera-side coding patterns. We also developed a hardware prototype to capture a real 3-D scene moving over time. We succeeded in acquiring a dynamic light field with 5x5 viewpoints over 4 temporal sub-frames (100 views in total) from a single observed image. Repeating capture and reconstruction processes over time, we can acquire a dynamic light field at 4x the frame rate of the camera. To our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve a finer temporal resolution than the camera itself in compressive light-field acquisition. Our software is available from our project webpage"
2204.12266,Attentive Fine-Grained Structured Sparsity for Image Restoration,"Image restoration tasks have witnessed great performance improvement in recent years by developing large deep models. Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly. PyTorch implementation for the proposed methods is available at https://github.com/JungHunOh/SLS_CVPR2022."
2204.12756,Talking Head Generation Driven by Speech-Related Facial Action Units and   Audio- Based on Multimodal Representation Fusion,"Talking head generation is to synthesize a lip-synchronized talking head video by inputting an arbitrary face image and corresponding audio clips. Existing methods ignore not only the interaction and relationship of cross-modal information, but also the local driving information of the mouth muscles. In this study, we propose a novel generative framework that contains a dilated non-causal temporal convolutional self-attention network as a multimodal fusion module to promote the relationship learning of cross-modal features. In addition, our proposed method uses both audio- and speech-related facial action units (AUs) as driving information. Speech-related AU information can guide mouth movements more accurately. Because speech is highly correlated with speech-related AUs, we propose an audio-to-AU module to predict speech-related AU information. We utilize pre-trained AU classifier to ensure that the generated images contain correct AU information. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on the GRID and TCD-TIMIT datasets. An ablation study is also conducted to verify the contribution of each component. The results of quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both image quality and lip-sync accuracy."
2204.12941,Unsupervised Learning of Unbiased Visual Representations,"Deep neural networks often struggle to learn robust representations in the presence of dataset biases, leading to suboptimal generalization on unbiased datasets. This limitation arises because the models heavily depend on peripheral and confounding factors, inadvertently acquired during training. Existing approaches to address this problem typically involve explicit supervision of bias attributes or reliance on prior knowledge about the biases. In this study, we address the challenging scenario where no explicit annotations of bias are available, and there's no prior knowledge about its nature. We present a fully unsupervised debiasing framework with three key steps: firstly, leveraging the inherent tendency to learn malignant biases to acquire a bias-capturing model; next, employing a pseudo-labeling process to obtain bias labels; and finally, applying cutting-edge supervised debiasing techniques to achieve an unbiased model. Additionally, we introduce a theoretical framework for evaluating model biasedness and conduct a detailed analysis of how biases impact neural network training. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in various settings, occasionally surpassing fully supervised debiasing approaches."
2204.13374,Morphing Attack Potential,"In security systems the risk assessment in the sense of common criteria testing is a very relevant topic; this requires quantifying the attack potential in terms of the expertise of the attacker, his knowledge about the target and access to equipment. Contrary to those attacks, the recently revealed morphing attacks against Face Recognition Systems (FRSs) can not be assessed by any of the above criteria. But not all morphing techniques pose the same risk for an operational face recognition system. This paper introduces with the Morphing Attack Potential (MAP) a consistent methodology, that can quantify the risk, which a certain morphing attack creates."
2204.13404,List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Image Prior,"List-mode positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction is an important tool for PET scanners with many lines-of-response and additional information such as time-of-flight and depth-of-interaction. Deep learning is one possible solution to enhance the quality of PET image reconstruction. However, the application of deep learning techniques to list-mode PET image reconstruction has not been progressed because list data is a sequence of bit codes and unsuitable for processing by convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this study, we propose a novel list-mode PET image reconstruction method using an unsupervised CNN called deep image prior (DIP) which is the first trial to integrate list-mode PET image reconstruction and CNN. The proposed list-mode DIP reconstruction (LM-DIPRecon) method alternatively iterates the regularized list-mode dynamic row action maximum likelihood algorithm (LM-DRAMA) and magnetic resonance imaging conditioned DIP (MR-DIP) using an alternating direction method of multipliers. We evaluated LM-DIPRecon using both simulation and clinical data, and it achieved sharper images and better tradeoff curves between contrast and noise than the LM-DRAMA, MR-DIP and sinogram-based DIPRecon methods. These results indicated that the LM-DIPRecon is useful for quantitative PET imaging with limited events while keeping accurate raw data information. In addition, as list data has finer temporal information than dynamic sinograms, list-mode deep image prior reconstruction is expected to be useful for 4D PET imaging and motion correction."
2204.13492,Representation Recycling for Streaming Video Analysis,"We present StreamDEQ, a method that aims to infer frame-wise representations on videos with minimal per-frame computation. Conventional deep networks do feature extraction from scratch at each frame in the absence of ad-hoc solutions. We instead aim to build streaming recognition models that can natively exploit temporal smoothness between consecutive video frames. We observe that the recently emerging implicit layer models provide a convenient foundation to construct such models, as they define representations as the fixed-points of shallow networks, which need to be estimated using iterative methods. Our main insight is to distribute the inference iterations over the temporal axis by using the most recent representation as a starting point at each frame. This scheme effectively recycles the recent inference computations and greatly reduces the needed processing time. Through extensive experimental analysis, we show that StreamDEQ is able to recover near-optimal representations in a few frames' time and maintain an up-to-date representation throughout the video duration. Our experiments on video semantic segmentation, video object detection, and human pose estimation in videos show that StreamDEQ achieves on-par accuracy with the baseline while being more than 2-4x faster."
2204.13620,Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Super-Resolution: A Survey,"Single image super-resolution (SISR) has played an important role in the field of image processing. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) can achieve excellent results on low-resolution images with small samples. However, there are little literatures summarizing different GANs in SISR. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of GANs from different perspectives. We first take a look at developments of GANs. Second, we present popular architectures for GANs in big and small samples for image applications. Then, we analyze motivations, implementations and differences of GANs based optimization methods and discriminative learning for image super-resolution in terms of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised manners, where these GANs are analyzed via integrating different network architectures, prior knowledge, loss functions and multiple tasks. Next, we compare performance of these popular GANs on public datasets via quantitative and qualitative analysis in SISR. Finally, we highlight challenges of GANs and potential research points for SISR."
2204.14030,Neural Implicit Representations for Physical Parameter Inference from a   Single Video,"Neural networks have recently been used to analyze diverse physical systems and to identify the underlying dynamics. While existing methods achieve impressive results, they are limited by their strong demand for training data and their weak generalization abilities to out-of-distribution data. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose to combine neural implicit representations for appearance modeling with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for modelling physical phenomena to obtain a dynamic scene representation that can be identified directly from visual observations. Our proposed model combines several unique advantages: (i) Contrary to existing approaches that require large training datasets, we are able to identify physical parameters from only a single video. (ii) The use of neural implicit representations enables the processing of high-resolution videos and the synthesis of photo-realistic images. (iii) The embedded neural ODE has a known parametric form that allows for the identification of interpretable physical parameters, and (iv) long-term prediction in state space. (v) Furthermore, the photo-realistic rendering of novel scenes with modified physical parameters becomes possible."
2204.14034,A Challenging Benchmark of Anime Style Recognition,"Given two images of different anime roles, anime style recognition (ASR) aims to learn abstract painting style to determine whether the two images are from the same work, which is an interesting but challenging problem. Unlike biometric recognition, such as face recognition, iris recognition, and person re-identification, ASR suffers from a much larger semantic gap but receives less attention. In this paper, we propose a challenging ASR benchmark. Firstly, we collect a large-scale ASR dataset (LSASRD), which contains 20,937 images of 190 anime works and each work at least has ten different roles. In addition to the large-scale, LSASRD contains a list of challenging factors, such as complex illuminations, various poses, theatrical colors and exaggerated compositions. Secondly, we design a cross-role protocol to evaluate ASR performance, in which query and gallery images must come from different roles to validate an ASR model is to learn abstract painting style rather than learn discriminative features of roles. Finally, we apply two powerful person re-identification methods, namely, AGW and TransReID, to construct the baseline performance on LSASRD. Surprisingly, the recent transformer model (i.e., TransReID) only acquires a 42.24% mAP on LSASRD. Therefore, we believe that the ASR task of a huge semantic gap deserves deep and long-term research. We will open our dataset and code at https://github.com/nkjcqvcpi/ASR."
2204.14100,Adversarial Distortion Learning for Medical Image Denoising,"We present a novel adversarial distortion learning (ADL) for denoising two- and three-dimensional (2D/3D) biomedical image data. The proposed ADL consists of two auto-encoders: a denoiser and a discriminator. The denoiser removes noise from input data and the discriminator compares the denoised result to its noise-free counterpart. This process is repeated until the discriminator cannot differentiate the denoised data from the reference. Both the denoiser and the discriminator are built upon a proposed auto-encoder called Efficient-Unet. Efficient-Unet has a light architecture that uses the residual blocks and a novel pyramidal approach in the backbone to efficiently extract and re-use feature maps. During training, the textural information and contrast are controlled by two novel loss functions. The architecture of Efficient-Unet allows generalizing the proposed method to any sort of biomedical data. The 2D version of our network was trained on ImageNet and tested on biomedical datasets whose distribution is completely different from ImageNet; so, there is no need for re-training. Experimental results carried out on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dermatoscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray datasets show that the proposed method achieved the best on each benchmark. Our implementation and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mogvision/ADL."
2205.00400,Convex Combination Consistency between Neighbors for Weakly-supervised   Action Localization,"Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) intends to detect action instances with only weak supervision, e.g., video-level labels. The current~\textit{de facto} pipeline locates action instances by thresholding and grouping continuous high-score regions on temporal class activation sequences. In this route, the capacity of the model to recognize the relationships between adjacent snippets is of vital importance which determines the quality of the action boundaries. However, it is error-prone since the variations between adjacent snippets are typically subtle, and unfortunately this is overlooked in the literature. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel WTAL approach named Convex Combination Consistency between Neighbors (C$^3$BN). C$^3$BN consists of two key ingredients: a micro data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity in-between adjacent snippets by convex combination of adjacent snippets, and a macro-micro consistency regularization that enforces the model to be invariant to the transformations~\textit{w.r.t.} video semantics, snippet predictions, and snippet representations. Consequently, fine-grained patterns in-between adjacent snippets are enforced to be explored, thereby resulting in a more robust action boundary localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of C$^3$BN on top of various baselines for WTAL with video-level and point-level supervisions. Code is at https://github.com/Qinying-Liu/C3BN."
2205.00415,Don't Blame the Annotator: Bias Already Starts in the Annotation   Instructions,"In recent years, progress in NLU has been driven by benchmarks. These benchmarks are typically collected by crowdsourcing, where annotators write examples based on annotation instructions crafted by dataset creators. In this work, we hypothesize that annotators pick up on patterns in the crowdsourcing instructions, which bias them to write many similar examples that are then over-represented in the collected data. We study this form of bias, termed instruction bias, in 14 recent NLU benchmarks, showing that instruction examples often exhibit concrete patterns, which are propagated by crowdworkers to the collected data. This extends previous work (Geva et al., 2019) and raises a new concern of whether we are modeling the dataset creator's instructions, rather than the task. Through a series of experiments, we show that, indeed, instruction bias can lead to overestimation of model performance, and that models struggle to generalize beyond biases originating in the crowdsourcing instructions. We further analyze the influence of instruction bias in terms of pattern frequency and model size, and derive concrete recommendations for creating future NLU benchmarks."
2205.00932,Understanding CNNs from excitations,"Saliency maps have proven to be a highly efficacious approach for explicating the decisions of Convolutional Neural Networks. However, extant methodologies predominantly rely on gradients, which constrain their ability to explicate complex models. Furthermore, such approaches are not fully adept at leveraging negative gradient information to improve interpretive veracity. In this study, we present a novel concept, termed positive and negative excitation, which enables the direct extraction of positive and negative excitation for each layer, thus enabling complete layer-by-layer information utilization sans gradients. To organize these excitations into final saliency maps, we introduce a double-chain backpropagation procedure. A comprehensive experimental evaluation, encompassing both binary classification and multi-classification tasks, was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of our proposed method. Encouragingly, the results evince that our approach offers a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of salient pixel removal, minor pixel removal, and inconspicuous adversarial perturbation generation guidance. Additionally, we verify the correlation between positive and negative excitations."
2205.01087,Incomplete Gamma Kernels: Generalizing Locally Optimal Projection   Operators,"We present incomplete gamma kernels, a generalization of Locally Optimal Projection (LOP) operators. In particular, we reveal the relation of the classical localized $ L_1 $ estimator, used in the LOP operator for point cloud denoising, to the common Mean Shift framework via a novel kernel. Furthermore, we generalize this result to a whole family of kernels that are built upon the incomplete gamma function and each represents a localized $ L_p $ estimator. By deriving various properties of the kernel family concerning distributional, Mean Shift induced, and other aspects such as strict positive definiteness, we obtain a deeper understanding of the operator's projection behavior. From these theoretical insights, we illustrate several applications ranging from an improved Weighted LOP (WLOP) density weighting scheme and a more accurate Continuous LOP (CLOP) kernel approximation to the definition of a novel set of robust loss functions. These incomplete gamma losses include the Gaussian and LOP loss as special cases and can be applied to various tasks including normal filtering. Furthermore, we show that the novel kernels can be included as priors into neural networks. We demonstrate the effects of each application in a range of quantitative and qualitative experiments that highlight the benefits induced by our modifications."
2205.02065,Mobile-URSONet: an Embeddable Neural Network for Onboard Spacecraft Pose   Estimation,"Spacecraft pose estimation is an essential computer vision application that can improve the autonomy of in-orbit operations. An ESA/Stanford competition brought out solutions that seem hardly compatible with the constraints imposed on spacecraft onboard computers. URSONet is among the best in the competition for its generalization capabilities but at the cost of a tremendous number of parameters and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Mobile-URSONet: a spacecraft pose estimation convolutional neural network with 178 times fewer parameters while degrading accuracy by no more than four times compared to URSONet."
2205.02507,Explicit View-labels Matter: A Multifacet Complementarity Study of   Multi-view Clustering,"Consistency and complementarity are two key ingredients for boosting multi-view clustering (MVC). Recently with the introduction of popular contrastive learning, the consistency learning of views has been further enhanced in MVC, leading to promising performance. However, by contrast, the complementarity has not received sufficient attention except just in the feature facet, where the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion term or the independent encoder-decoder network is usually adopted to capture view-specific information. This motivates us to reconsider the complementarity learning of views comprehensively from multiple facets including the feature-, view-label- and contrast- facets, while maintaining the view consistency. We empirically find that all the facets contribute to the complementarity learning, especially the view-label facet, which is usually neglected by existing methods. Based on this, a simple yet effective \underline{M}ultifacet \underline{C}omplementarity learning framework for \underline{M}ulti-\underline{V}iew \underline{C}lustering (MCMVC) is naturally developed, which fuses multifacet complementarity information, especially explicitly embedding the view-label information. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use view-labels explicitly to guide the complementarity learning of views. Compared with the SOTA baselines, MCMVC achieves remarkable improvements, e.g., by average margins over $5.00\%$ and $7.00\%$ respectively in complete and incomplete MVC settings on Caltech101-20 in terms of three evaluation metrics."
2205.02551,Biologically inspired deep residual networks for computer vision   applications,"Deep neural network has been ensured as a key technology in the field of many challenging and vigorously researched computer vision tasks. Furthermore, classical ResNet is thought to be a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) and was observed to capture features which can have good generalization ability. In this work, we propose a biologically inspired deep residual neural network where the hexagonal convolutions are introduced along the skip connections. The performance of different ResNet variants using square and hexagonal convolution are evaluated with the competitive training strategy mentioned by [1]. We show that the proposed approach advances the baseline image classification accuracy of vanilla ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10 and the same was observed over multiple subsets of the ImageNet 2012 dataset. We observed an average improvement by 1.35% and 0.48% on baseline top-1 accuracies for ImageNet 2012 and CIFAR-10, respectively. The proposed biologically inspired deep residual networks were observed to have improved generalized performance and this could be a potential research direction to improve the discriminative ability of state-of-the-art image classification networks."
2205.02691,The Batch Artifact Scanning Protocol: A new method using computed   tomography (CT) to rapidly create three-dimensional models of objects from   large collections en masse,"Within anthropology, the use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging has become increasingly common and widespread since it broadens the available avenues for addressing a wide range of key anthropological issues. The ease with which 3D models can be generated and shared has major impact on research, cultural heritage, education, science communication, and public engagement, as well as contributing to the preservation of the physical specimens and archiving collections in widely accessible data bases. Current scanning protocols have the ability to create the required research quality 3D models; however, they tend to be time and labor intensive and not practical when working with large collections. Here we describe a streamlined Batch Artifact Scanning Protocol to rapidly create 3D models using a medical CT scanner. While this method can be used on a variety of material types, we have, for specificity, applied our protocol to a large collection of experimentally broken ungulate limb bones. By employing the Batch Artifact Scanning Protocol, we were able to efficiently create 3D models of 2,474 bone fragments at a rate of less than 4 minutes per specimen."
2205.02692,Gait Recognition in the Wild: A Large-scale Benchmark and NAS-based   Baseline,"Gait benchmarks empower the research community to train and evaluate high-performance gait recognition systems. Even though growing efforts have been devoted to cross-view recognition, academia is restricted by current existing databases captured in the controlled environment. In this paper, we contribute a new benchmark and strong baseline for Gait REcognition in the Wild (GREW). The GREW dataset is constructed from natural videos, which contain hundreds of cameras and thousands of hours of streams in open systems. With tremendous manual annotations, the GREW consists of 26K identities and 128K sequences with rich attributes for unconstrained gait recognition. Moreover, we add a distractor set of over 233K sequences, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Compared with prevailing predefined cross-view datasets, the GREW has diverse and practical view variations, as well as more naturally challenging factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset for gait recognition in the wild. Equipped with this benchmark, we dissect the unconstrained gait recognition problem, where representative appearance-based and model-based methods are explored. The proposed GREW benchmark proves to be essential for both training and evaluating gait recognizers in unconstrained scenarios. In addition, we propose the Single Path One-Shot neural architecture search with uniform sampling for Gait recognition, named SPOSGait, which is the first NAS-based gait recognition model. In experiments, SPOSGait achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches by a large margin. The code will be released at https://github.com/XiandaGuo/SPOSGait."
2205.02830,Interaction Replica: Tracking Human-Object Interaction and Scene Changes   From Human Motion,"Our world is not static and humans naturally cause changes in their environments through interactions, e.g., opening doors or moving furniture. Modeling changes caused by humans is essential for building digital twins, e.g., in the context of shared physical-virtual spaces (metaverses) and robotics. In order for widespread adoption of such emerging applications, the sensor setup used to capture the interactions needs to be inexpensive and easy-to-use for non-expert users. I.e., interactions should be captured and modeled by simple ego-centric sensors such as a combination of cameras and IMU sensors, not relying on any external cameras or object trackers. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no work tackling the challenging problem of modeling human-scene interactions via such an ego-centric sensor setup exists. This paper closes this gap in the literature by developing a novel approach that combines visual localization of humans in the scene with contact-based reasoning about human-scene interactions from IMU data. Interestingly, we can show that even without visual observations of the interactions, human-scene contacts and interactions can be realistically predicted from human pose sequences. Our method, iReplica (Interaction Replica), is an essential first step towards the egocentric capture of human interactions and modeling of dynamic scenes, which is required for future AR/VR applications in immersive virtual universes and for training machines to behave like humans. Our code, data and model are available on our project page at http://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ireplica/"
2205.03057,Incremental Data-Uploading for Full-Quantum Classification,"The data representation in a machine-learning model strongly influences its performance. This becomes even more important for quantum machine learning models implemented on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Encoding high dimensional data into a quantum circuit for a NISQ device without any loss of information is not trivial and brings a lot of challenges. While simple encoding schemes (like single qubit rotational gates to encode high dimensional data) often lead to information loss within the circuit, complex encoding schemes with entanglement and data re-uploading lead to an increase in the encoding gate count. This is not well-suited for NISQ devices. This work proposes 'incremental data-uploading', a novel encoding pattern for high dimensional data that tackles these challenges. We spread the encoding gates for the feature vector of a given data point throughout the quantum circuit with parameterized gates in between them. This encoding pattern results in a better representation of data in the quantum circuit with a minimal pre-processing requirement. We show the efficiency of our encoding pattern on a classification task using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, and compare different encoding methods via classification accuracy and the effective dimension of the model."
2205.03186,Semantics-Guided Moving Object Segmentation with 3D LiDAR,"Moving object segmentation (MOS) is a task to distinguish moving objects, e.g., moving vehicles and pedestrians, from the surrounding static environment. The segmentation accuracy of MOS can have an influence on odometry, map construction, and planning tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantics-guided convolutional neural network for moving object segmentation. The network takes sequential LiDAR range images as inputs. Instead of segmenting the moving objects directly, the network conducts single-scan-based semantic segmentation and multiple-scan-based moving object segmentation in turn. The semantic segmentation module provides semantic priors for the MOS module, where we propose an adjacent scan association (ASA) module to convert the semantic features of adjacent scans into the same coordinate system to fully exploit the cross-scan semantic features. Finally, by analyzing the difference between the transformed features, reliable MOS result can be obtained quickly. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI MOS dataset proves the effectiveness of our work."
2205.03677,Block Modulating Video Compression: An Ultra Low Complexity Image   Compression Encoder for Resource Limited Platforms,"We consider the image and video compression on resource limited platforms. An ultra low-cost image encoder, named Block Modulating Video Compression (BMVC) with an encoding complexity ${\cal O}(1)$ is proposed to be implemented on mobile platforms with low consumption of power and computation resources. We also develop two types of BMVC decoders, implemented by deep neural networks. The first BMVC decoder is based on the Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm, which is flexible to different compression ratios. And the second decoder is a memory efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network, which aims for real-time decoding. Extensive results on the high definition images and videos demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed codec and the robustness against bit quantization."
2205.03991,A Nonlocal Graph-PDE and Higher-Order Geometric Integration for Image   Labeling,"This paper introduces a novel nonlocal partial difference equation (G-PDE) for labeling metric data on graphs. The G-PDE is derived as nonlocal reparametrization of the assignment flow approach that was introduced in \textit{J.~Math.~Imaging \& Vision} 58(2), 2017. Due to this parameterization, solving the G-PDE numerically is shown to be equivalent to computing the Riemannian gradient flow with respect to a nonconvex potential. We devise an entropy-regularized difference-of-convex-functions (DC) decomposition of this potential and show that the basic geometric Euler scheme for integrating the assignment flow is equivalent to solving the G-PDE by an established DC programming scheme. Moreover, the viewpoint of geometric integration reveals a basic way to exploit higher-order information of the vector field that drives the assignment flow, in order to devise a novel accelerated DC programming scheme. A detailed convergence analysis of both numerical schemes is provided and illustrated by numerical experiments."
2205.04326,Deeply Supervised Skin Lesions Diagnosis with Stage and Branch Attention,"Accurate and unbiased examinations of skin lesions are critical for the early diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases. Visual features of skin lesions vary significantly because the images are collected from patients with different lesion colours and morphologies by using dissimilar imaging equipment. Recent studies have reported that ensembled convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are practical to classify the images for early diagnosis of skin disorders. However, the practical use of these ensembled CNNs is limited as these networks are heavyweight and inadequate for processing contextual information. Although lightweight networks (e.g., MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet) were developed to achieve parameters reduction for implementing deep neural networks on mobile devices, insufficient depth of feature representation restricts the performance. To address the existing limitations, we develop a new lite and effective neural network, namely HierAttn. The HierAttn applies a novel deep supervision strategy to learn the local and global features by using multi-stage and multi-branch attention mechanisms with only one training loss. The efficacy of HierAttn was evaluated by using the dermoscopy images dataset ISIC2019 and smartphone photos dataset PAD-UFES-20 (PAD2020). The experimental results show that HierAttn achieves the best accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) among the state-of-the-art lightweight networks. The code is available at https://github.com/anthonyweidai/HierAttn."
2205.04382,FlowBot3D: Learning 3D Articulation Flow to Manipulate Articulated   Objects,"We explore a novel method to perceive and manipulate 3D articulated objects that generalizes to enable a robot to articulate unseen classes of objects. We propose a vision-based system that learns to predict the potential motions of the parts of a variety of articulated objects to guide downstream motion planning of the system to articulate the objects. To predict the object motions, we train a neural network to output a dense vector field representing the point-wise motion direction of the points in the point cloud under articulation. We then deploy an analytical motion planner based on this vector field to achieve a policy that yields maximum articulation. We train the vision system entirely in simulation, and we demonstrate the capability of our system to generalize to unseen object instances and novel categories in both simulation and the real world, deploying our policy on a Sawyer robot with no finetuning. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world experiments."
2205.04691,Probabilistic Approach for Detection of High-Frequency Periodic Signals   using an Event Camera,"Being inspired by the biological eye, event camera is a novel asynchronous technology that pose a paradigm shift in acquisition of visual information. This paradigm enables event cameras to capture pixel-size fast motions much more naturally compared to classical cameras.   In this paper we present a new asynchronous event-driven algorithm for detection of high-frequency pixel-size periodic signals using an event camera. Development of such new algorithms, to efficiently process the asynchronous information of event cameras, is essential and being a main challenge in the research community, in order to utilize its special properties and potential.   It turns out that this algorithm, that was developed in order to satisfy the new paradigm, is related to an untreated theoretical problem in probability: let $0\leq\tau_{1}\leq\tau_{2}\leq\cdots\leq\tau_{m}\leq1$, originated from an unknown distribution. Let also $\epsilon,\delta\in\mathbb{R}$, and $d\in\mathbb{N}$. What can be said about the probability $\Phi(m,d)$ of having more than $d$ adjacent $\tau_{i}$-s pairs that the distance between them is $\delta$, up to an error $\epsilon$ ? This problem, that reminds the area of order statistic, shows how the new visualization paradigm is also an opportunity to develop new areas and problems in mathematics."
2205.05419,Multi-Label Logo Recognition and Retrieval based on Weighted Fusion of   Neural Features,"Classifying logo images is a challenging task as they contain elements such as text or shapes that can represent anything from known objects to abstract shapes. While the current state of the art for logo classification addresses the problem as a multi-class task focusing on a single characteristic, logos can have several simultaneous labels, such as different colors. This work proposes a method that allows visually similar logos to be classified and searched from a set of data according to their shape, color, commercial sector, semantics, general characteristics, or a combination of features selected by the user. Unlike previous approaches, the proposal employs a series of multi-label deep neural networks specialized in specific attributes and combines the obtained features to perform the similarity search. To delve into the classification system, different existing logo topologies are compared and some of their problems are analyzed, such as the incomplete labeling that trademark registration databases usually contain. The proposal is evaluated considering 76,000 logos (7 times more than previous approaches) from the European Union Trademarks dataset, which is organized hierarchically using the Vienna ontology. Overall, experimentation attains reliable quantitative and qualitative results, reducing the normalized average rank error of the state-of-the-art from 0.040 to 0.018 for the Trademark Image Retrieval task. Finally, given that the semantics of logos can often be subjective, graphic design students and professionals were surveyed. Results show that the proposed methodology provides better labeling than a human expert operator, improving the label ranking average precision from 0.53 to 0.68."
2205.05967,Target Aware Network Architecture Search and Compression for Efficient   Knowledge Transfer,"Transfer Learning enables Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to acquire knowledge from a source domain and transfer it to a target domain, where collecting large-scale annotated examples is time-consuming and expensive. Conventionally, while transferring the knowledge learned from one task to another task, the deeper layers of a pre-trained CNN are finetuned over the target dataset. However, these layers are originally designed for the source task which may be over-parameterized for the target task. Thus, finetuning these layers over the target dataset may affect the generalization ability of the CNN due to high network complexity. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage framework called TASCNet which enables efficient knowledge transfer. In the first stage, the configuration of the deeper layers is learned automatically and finetuned over the target dataset. Later, in the second stage, the redundant filters are pruned from the fine-tuned CNN to decrease the network's complexity for the target task while preserving the performance. This two-stage mechanism finds a compact version of the pre-trained CNN with optimal structure (number of filters in a convolutional layer, number of neurons in a dense layer, and so on) from the hypothesis space. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated using VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121 on CalTech-101, CalTech-256, and Stanford Dogs datasets. Similar to computer vision tasks, we have also conducted experiments on Movie Review Sentiment Analysis task. The proposed TASCNet reduces the computational complexity of pre-trained CNNs over the target task by reducing both trainable parameters and FLOPs which enables resource-efficient knowledge transfer. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Debapriya-Tula/TASCNet."
2205.06197,Image Segmentation with Topological Priors,"Solving segmentation tasks with topological priors proved to make fewer errors in fine-scale structures. In this work, we use topological priors both before and during the deep neural network training procedure. We compared the results of the two approaches with simple segmentation on various accuracy metrics and the Betti number error, which is directly related to topological correctness, and discovered that incorporating topological information into the classical UNet model performed significantly better. We conducted experiments on the ISBI EM segmentation dataset."
2205.06265,ELODI: Ensemble Logit Difference Inhibition for Positive-Congruent   Training,"Negative flips are errors introduced in a classification system when a legacy model is updated. Existing methods to reduce the negative flip rate (NFR) either do so at the expense of overall accuracy by forcing a new model to imitate the old models, or use ensembles, which multiply inference cost prohibitively. We analyze the role of ensembles in reducing NFR and observe that they remove negative flips that are typically not close to the decision boundary, but often exhibit large deviations in the distance among their logits. Based on the observation, we present a method, called Ensemble Logit Difference Inhibition (ELODI), to train a classification system that achieves paragon performance in both error rate and NFR, at the inference cost of a single model. The method distills a homogeneous ensemble to a single student model which is used to update the classification system. ELODI also introduces a generalized distillation objective, Logit Difference Inhibition (LDI), which only penalizes the logit difference of a subset of classes with the highest logit values. On multiple image classification benchmarks, model updates with ELODI demonstrate superior accuracy retention and NFR reduction."
2205.06701,Knowledge Distillation Meets Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning,"Existing knowledge distillation methods mostly focus on distillation of teacher's prediction and intermediate activation. However, the structured representation, which arguably is one of the most critical ingredients of deep models, is largely overlooked. In this work, we propose a novel {\em \modelname{}} ({\bf\em \shortname{})} method dedicated for distilling representational knowledge semantically from a pretrained teacher to a target student. The key idea is that we leverage the teacher's classifier as a semantic critic for evaluating the representations of both teacher and student and distilling the semantic knowledge with high-order structured information over all feature dimensions. This is accomplished by introducing a notion of cross-network logit computed through passing student's representation into teacher's classifier. Further, considering the set of seen classes as a basis for the semantic space in a combinatorial perspective, we scale \shortname{} to unseen classes for enabling effective exploitation of largely available, arbitrary unlabeled training data. At the problem level, this establishes an interesting connection between knowledge distillation with open-set semi-supervised learning (SSL). Extensive experiments show that our \shortname{} outperforms significantly previous state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods on both coarse object classification and fine face recognition tasks, as well as less studied yet practically crucial binary network distillation. Under more realistic open-set SSL settings we introduce, we reveal that knowledge distillation is generally more effective than existing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) sample detection, and our proposed \shortname{} is superior over both previous distillation and SSL competitors. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/jingyang2017/SRD\_ossl}."
2205.06740,Towards Deployable OCR models for Indic languages,"Recognition of text on word or line images, without the need for sub-word segmentation has become the mainstream of research and development of text recognition for Indian languages. Modelling unsegmented sequences using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is the most commonly used approach for segmentation-free OCR. In this work we present a comprehensive empirical study of various neural network models that uses CTC for transcribing step-wise predictions in the neural network output to a Unicode sequence. The study is conducted for 13 Indian languages, using an internal dataset that has around 1000 pages per language. We study the choice of line vs word as the recognition unit, and use of synthetic data to train the models. We compare our models with popular publicly available OCR tools for end-to-end document image recognition. Our end-to-end pipeline that employ our recognition models and existing text segmentation tools outperform these public OCR tools for 8 out of the 13 languages. We also introduce a new public dataset called Mozhi for word and line recognition in Indian language. The dataset contains more than 1.2 million annotated word images (120 thousand text lines) across 13 Indian languages. Our code, trained models and the Mozhi dataset will be made available at http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/"
2205.06891,Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D MRI Super Resolution with   Degradation Adaptation,"High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging is critical in aiding doctors in their diagnoses and image-guided treatments. However, acquiring HR images can be time-consuming and costly. Consequently, deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has emerged as a promising solution for generating super-resolution (SR) images from low-resolution (LR) images. Unfortunately, training such neural networks requires aligned authentic HR and LR image pairs, which are challenging to obtain due to patient movements during and between image acquisitions. While rigid movements of hard tissues can be corrected with image registration, aligning deformed soft tissues is complex, making it impractical to train neural networks with authentic HR and LR image pairs. Previous studies have focused on SRR using authentic HR images and down-sampled synthetic LR images. However, the difference in degradation representations between synthetic and authentic LR images suppresses the quality of SR images reconstructed from authentic LR images. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unsupervised Degradation Adaptation Network (UDEAN). Our network consists of a degradation learning network and an SRR network. The degradation learning network downsamples the HR images using the degradation representation learned from the misaligned or unpaired LR images. The SRR network then learns the mapping from the down-sampled HR images to the original ones. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art networks and is a promising solution to the challenges in clinical settings."
2205.07002,Panoptic-PHNet: Towards Real-Time and High-Precision LiDAR Panoptic   Segmentation via Clustering Pseudo Heatmap,"As a rising task, panoptic segmentation is faced with challenges in both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. However, in terms of speed and accuracy, existing LiDAR methods in the field are still limited. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance LiDAR-based framework, referred to as Panoptic-PHNet, with three attractive aspects: 1) We introduce a clustering pseudo heatmap as a new paradigm, which, followed by a center grouping module, yields instance centers for efficient clustering without object-level learning tasks. 2) A knn-transformer module is proposed to model the interaction among foreground points for accurate offset regression. 3) For backbone design, we fuse the fine-grained voxel features and the 2D Bird's Eye View (BEV) features with different receptive fields to utilize both detailed and global information. Extensive experiments on both SemanticKITTI dataset and nuScenes dataset show that our Panoptic-PHNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins with a real-time speed. We achieve the 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and leading performance on the recently released leaderboard of nuScenes."
2205.07085,Monitoring of Pigmented Skin Lesions Using 3D Whole Body Imaging,"Advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning have great potential to redefine how skin lesions are detected, mapped, tracked and documented. Here, We propose a 3D whole-body imaging system known as 3DSkin-mapper to enable automated detection, evaluation and mapping of skin lesions. A modular camera rig arranged in a cylindrical configuration was designed to automatically capture images of the entire skin surface of a subject synchronously from multiple angles. Based on the images, we developed algorithms for 3D model reconstruction, data processing and skin lesion detection and tracking based on deep convolutional neural networks. We also introduced a customised, user-friendly, and adaptable interface that enables individuals to interactively visualise, manipulate, and annotate the images. The proposed system is developed for skin lesion screening, the focus of this paper is to introduce the system instead of clinical study. Using synthetic and real images we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system by providing multiple views of a target skin lesion, enabling further 3D geometry analysis and longitudinal tracking. It takes only a few seconds to capture the entire skin surface, and about half an hour to process and analyse the images. Our experiments show that the proposed system allow fast and easy whole body 3D imaging. It can be used by dermatological clinics to conduct skin screening, detect and track skin lesions over time, identify suspicious lesions, and document pigmented lesions. The system can potentially save clinicians time and effort significantly. The 3D imaging and analysis has the potential to change the paradigm of whole body photography with many applications in skin diseases, including inflammatory and pigmentary disorders."
2205.07404,A New Outlier Removal Strategy Based on Reliability of Correspondence   Graph for Fast Point Cloud Registration,"Registration is a basic yet crucial task in point cloud processing. In correspondence-based point cloud registration, matching correspondences by point feature techniques may lead to an extremely high outlier ratio. Current methods still suffer from low efficiency, accuracy, and recall rate. We use a simple and intuitive method to describe the 6-DOF (degree of freedom) curtailment process in point cloud registration and propose an outlier removal strategy based on the reliability of the correspondence graph. The method constructs the corresponding graph according to the given correspondences and designs the concept of the reliability degree of the graph node for optimal candidate selection and the reliability degree of the graph edge to obtain the global maximum consensus set. The presented method could achieve fast and accurate outliers removal along with gradual aligning parameters estimation. Extensive experiments on simulations and challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can still perform effective point cloud registration even the correspondence outlier ratio is over 99%, and the efficiency is better than the state-of-the-art. Code is available at https://github.com/WPC-WHU/GROR."
2205.07575,An automatic pipeline for atlas-based fetal and neonatal brain   segmentation and analysis,"The automatic segmentation of perinatal brain structures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of utmost importance for the study of brain growth and related complications. While different methods exist for adult and pediatric MRI data, there is a lack for automatic tools for the analysis of perinatal imaging. In this work, a new pipeline for fetal and neonatal segmentation has been developed. We also report the creation of two new fetal atlases, and their use within the pipeline for atlas-based segmentation, based on novel registration methods. The pipeline is also able to extract cortical and pial surfaces and compute features, such as curvature, thickness, sulcal depth, and local gyrification index. Results show that the introduction of the new templates together with our segmentation strategy leads to accurate results when compared to expert annotations, as well as better performances when compared to a reference pipeline (developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)), for both early and late-onset fetal brains."
2205.07611,Noise-Tolerant Learning for Audio-Visual Action Recognition,"Recently, video recognition is emerging with the help of multi-modal learning, which focuses on integrating distinct modalities to improve the performance or robustness of the model. Although various multi-modal learning methods have been proposed and offer remarkable recognition results, almost all of these methods rely on high-quality manual annotations and assume that modalities among multi-modal data provide semantically relevant information. Unfortunately, the widely used video datasets are usually coarse-annotated or collected from the Internet. Thus, it inevitably contains a portion of noisy labels and noisy correspondence. To address this challenge, we use the audio-visual action recognition task as a proxy and propose a noise-tolerant learning framework to find anti-interference model parameters against both noisy labels and noisy correspondence. Specifically, our method consists of two phases that aim to rectify noise by the inherent correlation between modalities. First, a noise-tolerant contrastive training phase is performed to make the model immune to the possible noisy-labeled data. To alleviate the influence of noisy correspondence, we propose a cross-modal noise estimation component to adjust the consistency between different modalities. As the noisy correspondence existed at the instance level, we further propose a category-level contrastive loss to reduce its interference. Second, in the hybrid-supervised training phase, we calculate the distance metric among features to obtain corrected labels, which are used as complementary supervision to guide the training. Extensive experiments on a wide range of noisy levels demonstrate that our method significantly improves the robustness of the action recognition model and surpasses the baselines by a clear margin."
2205.07708,Exploring Diversity-based Active Learning for 3D Object Detection in   Autonomous Driving,"3D object detection has recently received much attention due to its great potential in autonomous vehicle (AV). The success of deep learning based object detectors relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, which is time-consuming and expensive to compile, especially for 3D bounding box annotation. In this work, we investigate diversity-based active learning (AL) as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. Given limited annotation budget, only the most informative frames and objects are automatically selected for human to annotate. Technically, we take the advantage of the multimodal information provided in an AV dataset, and propose a novel acquisition function that enforces spatial and temporal diversity in the selected samples. We benchmark the proposed method against other AL strategies under realistic annotation cost measurement, where the realistic costs for annotating a frame and a 3D bounding box are both taken into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes dataset and show that it outperforms existing AL strategies significantly.

2205.08143,Brachial Plexus Nerve Trunk Segmentation Using Deep Learning: A   Comparative Study with Doctors' Manual Segmentation,"Ultrasound-guided nerve block anesthesia (UGNB) is a high-tech visual nerve block anesthesia method that can observe the target nerve and its surrounding structures, the puncture needle's advancement, and local anesthetics spread in real-time. The key in UGNB is nerve identification. With the help of deep learning methods, the automatic identification or segmentation of nerves can be realized, assisting doctors in completing nerve block anesthesia accurately and efficiently. Here, we establish a public dataset containing 320 ultrasound images of brachial plexus (BP). Three experienced doctors jointly produce the BP segmentation ground truth and label brachial plexus trunks. We design a brachial plexus segmentation system (BPSegSys) based on deep learning. BPSegSys achieves experienced-doctor-level nerve identification performance in various experiments. We evaluate BPSegSys' performance in terms of intersection-over-union (IoU), a commonly used performance measure for segmentation experiments. Considering three dataset groups in our established public dataset, the IoU of BPSegSys are 0.5238, 0.4715, and 0.5029, respectively, which exceed the IoU 0.5205, 0.4704, and 0.4979 of experienced doctors. In addition, we show that BPSegSys can help doctors identify brachial plexus trunks more accurately, with IoU improvement up to 27%, which has significant clinical application value."
2205.08372,Automatic Stack Velocity Picking Using an Unsupervised Ensemble Learning   Method,"Seismic velocity picking algorithms that are both accurate and efficient can greatly speed up seismic data processing, with the primary approach being the use of velocity spectra. Despite the development of some supervised deep learning-based approaches to automatically pick the velocity, they often come with costly manual labeling expenses or lack interpretability. In comparison, using physical knowledge to drive unsupervised learning techniques has the potential to solve this problem in an efficient manner. We suggest an Unsupervised Ensemble Learning (UEL) approach to achieving a balance between reliance on labeled data and picking accuracy, with the aim of determining the stack velocity. UEL makes use of the data from nearby velocity spectra and other known sources to help pick efficient and reasonable velocity points, which are acquired through a clustering technique. Testing on both the synthetic and field data sets shows that UEL is more reliable and precise in auto-picking than traditional clustering-based techniques and the widely used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method."
2205.08745,Validation of a photogrammetric approach for the objective study of   ancient bowed instruments,"Some early violins have been reduced during their history to fit imposed morphological standards, while more recent ones have been built directly to these standards. We propose an objective photogrammetric approach to differentiate between a reduced and an unreduced instrument, whereby a three-dimensional mesh is studied geometrically by examining 2D slices. Our contribution is twofold. First, we validate the quality of the photogrammetric mesh through a comparison with reference images obtained by medical imaging, and conclude that a sub-millimetre accuracy is achieved. Then, we show how quantitative and qualitative features such as contour lines, channel of minima and a measure of asymmetry between the upper and lower surfaces of a violin can be automatically extracted from the validated photogrammetric meshes, allowing to successfully highlight differences between instruments."
2205.08989,Defending Object Detectors against Patch Attacks with   Out-of-Distribution Smoothing,"Patch attacks against object detectors have been of recent interest due to their being physically realizable and more closely aligned with practical systems. In response to this threat, many new defenses have been proposed that train a patch segmenter model to detect and remove the patch before the image is passed to the downstream model. We unify these approaches with a flexible framework, OODSmoother, which characterizes the properties of approaches that aim to remove adversarial patches. This framework naturally guides us to design 1) a novel adaptive attack that breaks existing patch attack defenses on object detectors, and 2) a novel defense approach SemPrior that takes advantage of semantic priors. Our key insight behind SemPrior is that the existing machine learning-based patch detectors struggle to learn semantic priors and that explicitly incorporating them can improve performance. We find that SemPrior alone provides up to a 40% gain, or up to a 60% gain when combined with existing defenses."
2205.09180,Learning Rate Curriculum,"Most curriculum learning methods require an approach to sort the data samples by difficulty, which is often cumbersome to perform. In this work, we propose a novel curriculum learning approach termed Learning Rate Curriculum (LeRaC), which leverages the use of a different learning rate for each layer of a neural network to create a data-agnostic curriculum during the initial training epochs. More specifically, LeRaC assigns higher learning rates to neural layers closer to the input, gradually decreasing the learning rates as the layers are placed farther away from the input. The learning rates increase at various paces during the first training iterations, until they all reach the same value. From this point on, the neural model is trained as usual. This creates a model-level curriculum learning strategy that does not require sorting the examples by difficulty and is compatible with any neural network, generating higher performance levels regardless of the architecture. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 12 data sets from the computer vision (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet-200, Food-101, UTKFace, PASCAL VOC), language (BoolQ, QNLI, RTE) and audio (ESC-50, CREMA-D) domains, considering various convolutional (ResNet-18, Wide-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, YOLOv5), recurrent (LSTM) and transformer (CvT, BERT, SepTr) architectures. We compare our approach with the conventional training regime, as well as with Curriculum by Smoothing (CBS), a state-of-the-art data-agnostic curriculum learning approach. Unlike CBS, our performance improvements over the standard training regime are consistent across all data sets and models. Furthermore, we significantly surpass CBS in terms of training time (there is no additional cost over the standard training regime for LeRaC). Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/LeRaC."
2205.09442,Oracle-MNIST: a Dataset of Oracle Characters for Benchmarking Machine   Learning Algorithms,"We introduce the Oracle-MNIST dataset, comprising of 28$\times $28 grayscale images of 30,222 ancient characters from 10 categories, for benchmarking pattern classification, with particular challenges on image noise and distortion. The training set totally consists of 27,222 images, and the test set contains 300 images per class. Oracle-MNIST shares the same data format with the original MNIST dataset, allowing for direct compatibility with all existing classifiers and systems, but it constitutes a more challenging classification task than MNIST. The images of ancient characters suffer from 1) extremely serious and unique noises caused by three-thousand years of burial and aging and 2) dramatically variant writing styles by ancient Chinese, which all make them realistic for machine learning research. The dataset is freely available at https://github.com/wm-bupt/oracle-mnist."
2205.09615,EXACT: How to Train Your Accuracy,"Classification tasks are usually evaluated in terms of accuracy. However, accuracy is discontinuous and cannot be directly optimized using gradient ascent. Popular methods minimize cross-entropy, hinge loss, or other surrogate losses, which can lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework by introducing stochasticity to a model's output and optimizing expected accuracy, i.e. accuracy of the stochastic model. Extensive experiments on linear models and deep image classification show that the proposed optimization method is a powerful alternative to widely used classification losses."
2205.10003,InDistill: Information flow-preserving knowledge distillation for model   compression,"In this paper, we introduce InDistill, a method that serves as a warmup stage for enhancing Knowledge Distillation (KD) effectiveness. InDistill focuses on transferring critical information flow paths from a heavyweight teacher to a lightweight student. This is achieved via a training scheme based on curriculum learning that considers the distillation difficulty of each layer and the critical learning periods when the information flow paths are established. This procedure can lead to a student model that is better prepared to learn from the teacher. To ensure the applicability of InDistill across a wide range of teacher-student pairs, we also incorporate a pruning operation when there is a discrepancy in the width of the teacher and student layers. This pruning operation reduces the width of the teacher's intermediate layers to match those of the student, allowing direct distillation without the need for an encoding stage. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using various pairs of teacher-student architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets demonstrating that preserving the information flow paths consistently increases the performance of the baseline KD approaches on both classification and retrieval settings. The code is available at https://github.com/gsarridis/InDistill."
2205.10089,Kernel Normalized Convolutional Networks,"Existing convolutional neural network architectures frequently rely upon batch normalization (BatchNorm) to effectively train the model. BatchNorm, however, performs poorly with small batch sizes, and is inapplicable to differential privacy. To address these limitations, we propose the kernel normalization (KernelNorm) and kernel normalized convolutional layers, and incorporate them into kernel normalized convolutional networks (KNConvNets) as the main building blocks. We implement KNConvNets corresponding to the state-of-the-art ResNets while forgoing the BatchNorm layers. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate that KNConvNets achieve higher or competitive performance compared to the BatchNorm counterparts in image classification and semantic segmentation. They also significantly outperform their batch-independent competitors including those based on layer and group normalization in non-private and differentially private training. Given that, KernelNorm combines the batch-independence property of layer and group normalization with the performance advantage of BatchNorm."
2205.10120,Privacy Preserving Image Registration,"Image registration is a key task in medical imaging applications, allowing to represent medical images in a common spatial reference frame. Current approaches to image registration are generally based on the assumption that the content of the images is usually accessible in clear form, from which the spatial transformation is subsequently estimated. This common assumption may not be met in practical applications, since the sensitive nature of medical images may ultimately require their analysis under privacy constraints, preventing to openly share the image content.In this work, we formulate the problem of image registration under a privacy preserving regime, where images are assumed to be confidential and cannot be disclosed in clear. We derive our privacy preserving image registration framework by extending classical registration paradigms to account for advanced cryptographic tools, such as secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, that enable the execution of operations without leaking the underlying data. To overcome the problem of performance and scalability of cryptographic tools in high dimensions, we propose several techniques to optimize the image registration operations by using gradient approximations, and by revisiting the use of homomorphic encryption trough packing, to allow the efficient encryption and multiplication of large matrices. We demonstrate our privacy preserving framework in linear and non-linear registration problems, evaluating its accuracy and scalability with respect to standard, non-private counterparts. Our results show that privacy preserving image registration is feasible and can be adopted in sensitive medical imaging applications."
2205.10347,Diverse super-resolution with pretrained deep hiererarchical VAEs,"We investigate the problem of producing diverse solutions to an image super-resolution problem. From a probabilistic perspective, this can be done by sampling from the posterior distribution of an inverse problem, which requires the definition of a prior distribution on the high-resolution images. In this work, we propose to use a pretrained hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) as a prior. We train a lightweight stochastic encoder to encode low-resolution images in the latent space of a pretrained HVAE. At inference, we combine the low-resolution encoder and the pretrained generative model to super-resolve an image. We demonstrate on the task of face super-resolution that our method provides an advantageous trade-off between the computational efficiency of conditional normalizing flows techniques and the sample quality of diffusion based methods."
2205.10373,A SSIM Guided cGAN Architecture For Clinically Driven Generative Image   Synthesis of Multiplexed Spatial Proteomics Channels,"Here we present a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) guided conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that generatively performs image-to-image (i2i) synthesis to generate photo-accurate protein channels in multiplexed spatial proteomics images. This approach can be utilized to accurately generate missing spatial proteomics channels that were not included during experimental data collection either at the bench or the clinic. Experimental spatial proteomic data from the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) was used to generate spatial representations of missing proteins through a U-Net based image synthesis pipeline. HuBMAP channels were hierarchically clustered by the (SSIM) as a heuristic to obtain the minimal set needed to recapitulate the underlying biology represented by the spatial landscape of proteins. We subsequently prove that our SSIM based architecture allows for scaling of generative image synthesis to slides with up to 100 channels, which is better than current state of the art algorithms which are limited to data with 11 channels. We validate these claims by generating a new experimental spatial proteomics data set from human lung adenocarcinoma tissue sections and show that a model trained on HuBMAP can accurately synthesize channels from our new data set. The ability to recapitulate experimental data from sparsely stained multiplexed histological slides containing spatial proteomic will have tremendous impact on medical diagnostics and drug development, and also raises important questions on the medical ethics of utilizing data produced by generative image synthesis in the clinical setting. The algorithm that we present in this paper will allow researchers and clinicians to save time and costs in proteomics based histological staining while also increasing the amount of data that they can generate through their experiments."
2205.10435,Towards Better Understanding Attribution Methods,"Deep neural networks are very successful on many vision tasks, but hard to interpret due to their black box nature. To overcome this, various post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed to identify image regions most influential to the models' decisions. Evaluating such methods is challenging since no ground truth attributions exist. We thus propose three novel evaluation schemes to more reliably measure the faithfulness of those methods, to make comparisons between them more fair, and to make visual inspection more systematic. To address faithfulness, we propose a novel evaluation setting (DiFull) in which we carefully control which parts of the input can influence the output in order to distinguish possible from impossible attributions. To address fairness, we note that different methods are applied at different layers, which skews any comparison, and so evaluate all methods on the same layers (ML-Att) and discuss how this impacts their performance on quantitative metrics. For more systematic visualizations, we propose a scheme (AggAtt) to qualitatively evaluate the methods on complete datasets. We use these evaluation schemes to study strengths and shortcomings of some widely used attribution methods. Finally, we propose a post-processing smoothing step that significantly improves the performance of some attribution methods, and discuss its applicability."
2205.10490,Aligning Logits Generatively for Principled Black-Box Knowledge   Distillation,"Black-Box Knowledge Distillation (B2KD) is a formulated problem for cloud-to-edge model compression with invisible data and models hosted on the server. B2KD faces challenges such as limited Internet exchange and edge-cloud disparity of data distributions. In this paper, we formalize a two-step workflow consisting of deprivatization and distillation, and theoretically provide a new optimization direction from logits to cell boundary different from direct logits alignment. With its guidance, we propose a new method Mapping-Emulation KD (MEKD) that distills a black-box cumbersome model into a lightweight one. Our method does not differentiate between treating soft or hard responses, and consists of: 1) deprivatization: emulating the inverse mapping of the teacher function with a generator, and 2) distillation: aligning low-dimensional logits of the teacher and student models by reducing the distance of high-dimensional image points. For different teacher-student pairs, our method yields inspiring distillation performance on various benchmarks, and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches."
2205.10667,Individual Topology Structure of Eye Movement Trajectories,"Traditionally, extracting patterns from eye movement data relies on statistics of different macro-events such as fixations and saccades. This requires an additional preprocessing step to separate the eye movement subtypes, often with a number of parameters on which the classification results depend. Besides that, definitions of such macro events are formulated in different ways by different researchers.   We propose an application of a new class of features to the quantitative analysis of personal eye movement trajectories structure. This new class of features based on algebraic topology allows extracting patterns from different modalities of gaze such as time series of coordinates and amplitudes, heatmaps, and point clouds in a unified way at all scales from micro to macro. We experimentally demonstrate the competitiveness of the new class of features with the traditional ones and their significant synergy while being used together for the person authentication task on the recently published eye movement trajectories dataset."
2205.10691,Producing Histopathology Phantom Images using Generative Adversarial   Networks to improve Tumor Detection,"Advance in medical imaging is an important part in deep learning research. One of the goals of computer vision is development of a holistic, comprehensive model which can identify tumors from histology slides obtained via biopsies. A major problem that stands in the way is lack of data for a few cancer-types. In this paper, we ascertain that data augmentation using GANs can be a viable solution to reduce the unevenness in the distribution of different cancer types in our dataset. Our demonstration showed that a dataset augmented to a 50% increase causes an increase in tumor detection from 80% to 87.5%"
2205.10766,Recent Advances in Embedding Methods for Multi-Object Tracking: A Survey,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to associate target objects across video frames in order to obtain entire moving trajectories. With the advancement of deep neural networks and the increasing demand for intelligent video analysis, MOT has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. Embedding methods play an essential role in object location estimation and temporal identity association in MOT. Unlike other computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, re-identification, and segmentation, embedding methods in MOT have large variations, and they have never been systematically analyzed and summarized. In this survey, we first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for embedding methods in MOT from seven different perspectives, including patch-level embedding, single-frame embedding, cross-frame joint embedding, correlation embedding, sequential embedding, tracklet embedding, and cross-track relational embedding. We further summarize the existing widely used MOT datasets and analyze the advantages of existing state-of-the-art methods according to their embedding strategies. Finally, some critical yet under-investigated areas and future research directions are discussed."
2205.10793,Knowledge Distillation via the Target-aware Transformer,"Knowledge distillation becomes a de facto standard to improve the performance of small neural networks. Most of the previous works propose to regress the representational features from the teacher to the student in a one-to-one spatial matching fashion. However, people tend to overlook the fact that, due to the architecture differences, the semantic information on the same spatial location usually vary. This greatly undermines the underlying assumption of the one-to-one distillation approach. To this end, we propose a novel one-to-all spatial matching knowledge distillation approach. Specifically, we allow each pixel of the teacher feature to be distilled to all spatial locations of the student features given its similarity, which is generated from a target-aware transformer. Our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on various computer vision benchmarks, such as ImageNet, Pascal VOC and COCOStuff10k. Code is available at https://github.com/sihaoevery/TaT."
2205.10839,Deep Learning for Visual Speech Analysis: A Survey,"Visual speech, referring to the visual domain of speech, has attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications, such as public security, medical treatment, military defense, and film entertainment. As a powerful AI strategy, deep learning techniques have extensively promoted the development of visual speech learning. Over the past five years, numerous deep learning based methods have been proposed to address various problems in this area, especially automatic visual speech recognition and generation. To push forward future research on visual speech, this paper aims to present a comprehensive review of recent progress in deep learning methods on visual speech analysis. We cover different aspects of visual speech, including fundamental problems, challenges, benchmark datasets, a taxonomy of existing methods, and state-of-the-art performance. Besides, we also identify gaps in current research and discuss inspiring future research directions."
2205.10933,AutoJoin: Efficient Adversarial Training against Gradient-Free   Perturbations for Robust Maneuvering via Denoising Autoencoder and Joint   Learning,"With the growing use of machine learning algorithms and ubiquitous sensors, many `perception-to-control' systems are being developed and deployed. To ensure their trustworthiness, improving their robustness through adversarial training is one potential approach. We propose a gradient-free adversarial training technique, named AutoJoin, to effectively and efficiently produce robust models for image-based maneuvering. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods with testing on over 5M images, AutoJoin achieves significant performance increases up to the 40% range against perturbations while improving on clean performance up to 300%. AutoJoin is also highly efficient, saving up to 86% time per training epoch and 90% training data over other state-of-the-art techniques. The core idea of AutoJoin is to use a decoder attachment to the original regression model creating a denoising autoencoder within the architecture. This architecture allows the tasks `maneuvering' and `denoising sensor input' to be jointly learnt and reinforce each other's performance."
2205.11100,Supporting Vision-Language Model Inference with Confounder-pruning   Knowledge Prompt,"Vision-language models are pre-trained by aligning image-text pairs in a common space to deal with open-set visual concepts. To boost the transferability of the pre-trained models, recent works adopt fixed or learnable prompts, i.e., classification weights are synthesized from natural language describing task-relevant categories, to reduce the gap between tasks in the training and test phases. However, how and what prompts can improve inference performance remains unclear. In this paper, we explicitly clarify the importance of including semantic information in prompts, while existing prompting methods generate prompts without exploring the semantic information of textual labels. Manually constructing prompts with rich semantics requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To cope with this issue, we propose a semantic-aware prompt learning method, namely CPKP, which retrieves an ontological knowledge graph by treating the textual label as a query to extract task-relevant semantic information. CPKP further introduces a double-tier confounder-pruning procedure to refine the derived semantic information. The graph-tier confounders are gradually identified and phased out, inspired by the principle of Granger causality. The feature-tier confounders are demolished by following the maximum entropy principle in information theory. Empirically, the evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CPKP, e.g., with two shots, CPKP outperforms the manual-prompt method by 4.64% and the learnable-prompt method by 1.09% on average, and the superiority of CPKP in domain generalization compared to benchmark approaches. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Mowenyii/CPKP."
2205.11109,Illuminating Salient Contributions in Neuron Activation with Attribution   Equilibrium,"With the remarkable success of deep neural networks, there is a growing interest in research aimed at providing clear interpretations of their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce Attribution Equilibrium, a novel method to decompose output predictions into fine-grained attributions, balancing positive and negative relevance for clearer visualization of the evidence behind a network decision. We carefully analyze conventional approaches to decision explanation and present a different perspective on the conservation of evidence. We define the evidence as a gap between positive and negative influences among gradient-derived initial contribution maps. Then, we incorporate antagonistic elements and a user-defined criterion for the degree of positive attribution during propagation. Additionally, we consider the role of inactivated neurons in the propagation rule, thereby enhancing the discernment of less relevant elements such as the background. We conduct various assessments in a verified experimental environment with PASCAL VOC 2007, MS COCO 2014, and ImageNet datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attribution methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in identifying the key input features that influence model decisions."
2205.11131,Heterogeneous Semantic Transfer for Multi-label Recognition with Partial   Labels,"Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL), in which some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, may greatly reduce the cost of annotation and thus facilitate large-scale MLR. We find that strong semantic correlations exist within each image and across different images, and these correlations can help transfer the knowledge possessed by the known labels to retrieve the unknown labels and thus improve the performance of the MLR-PL task (see Figure 1). In this work, we propose a novel heterogeneous semantic transfer (HST) framework that consists of two complementary transfer modules that explore both within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to transfer the knowledge possessed by known labels to generate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. Specifically, an intra-image semantic transfer (IST) module learns an image-specific label co-occurrence matrix for each image and maps the known labels to complement the unknown labels based on these matrices. Additionally, a cross-image transfer (CST) module learns category-specific feature-prototype similarities and then helps complement the unknown labels that have high degrees of similarity with the corresponding prototypes. Finally, both the known and generated pseudo labels are used to train MLR models. Extensive experiments conducted on the Microsoft COCO, Visual Genome, and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets show that the proposed HST framework achieves superior performance to that of current state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, it obtains mean average precision (mAP) improvements of 1.4%, 3.3%, and 0.4% on the three datasets over the results of the best-performing previously developed algorithm."
2205.11266,What You See is What You Classify: Black Box Attributions,"An important step towards explaining deep image classifiers lies in the identification of image regions that contribute to individual class scores in the model's output. However, doing this accurately is a difficult task due to the black-box nature of such networks. Most existing approaches find such attributions either using activations and gradients or by repeatedly perturbing the input. We instead address this challenge by training a second deep network, the Explainer, to predict attributions for a pre-trained black-box classifier, the Explanandum. These attributions are provided in the form of masks that only show the classifier-relevant parts of an image, masking out the rest. Our approach produces sharper and more boundary-precise masks when compared to the saliency maps generated by other methods. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches, ours is capable of directly generating very distinct class-specific masks in a single forward pass. This makes the proposed method very efficient during inference. We show that our attributions are superior to established methods both visually and quantitatively with respect to the PASCAL VOC-2007 and Microsoft COCO-2014 datasets."
2205.12224,GLObal Building heights for Urban Studies (UT-GLOBUS) for city- and   street- scale urban simulations: Development and first applications,"We introduce University of Texas - Global Building heights for Urban Studies (UT-GLOBUS), a dataset providing building heights and urban canopy parameters (UCPs) for more than 1200 cities or locales worldwide. UT-GLOBUS combines open-source spaceborne altimetry (ICESat-2 and GEDI) and coarse-resolution urban canopy elevation data with a machine-learning model to estimate building-level information. Validation using LiDAR data from six US cities showed UT-GLOBUS-derived building heights had a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.1 meters. Validation of mean building heights within 1-km^2 grid cells, including data from Hamburg and Sydney, resulted in an RMSE of 7.8 meters. Testing the UCPs in the urban Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Urban) model resulted in a significant improvement (55% in RMSE) in intra-urban air temperature representation compared to the existing table-based local climate zone approach in Houston, TX. Additionally, we demonstrated the dataset's utility for simulating heat mitigation strategies and building energy consumption using WRF-Urban, with test cases in Chicago, IL, and Austin, TX. Street-scale mean radiant temperature simulations using the Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model, incorporating UT-GLOBUS and LiDAR-derived building heights, confirmed the dataset's effectiveness in modeling human thermal comfort in Baltimore, MD (daytime RMSE = 2.85 C). Thus, UT-GLOBUS can be used for modeling urban hazards with significant socioeconomic and biometeorological risks, enabling finer scale urban climate simulations and overcoming previous limitations due to the lack of building information."
2205.12840,"SALAD: Source-free Active Label-Agnostic Domain Adaptation for   Classification, Segmentation and Detection","We present a novel method, SALAD, for the challenging vision task of adapting a pre-trained ""source"" domain network to a ""target"" domain, with a small budget for annotation in the ""target"" domain and a shift in the label space. Further, the task assumes that the source data is not available for adaptation, due to privacy concerns or otherwise. We postulate that such systems need to jointly optimize the dual task of (i) selecting fixed number of samples from the target domain for annotation and (ii) transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained network to the target domain. To do this, SALAD consists of a novel Guided Attention Transfer Network (GATN) and an active learning function, HAL. The GATN enables feature distillation from pre-trained network to the target network, complemented with the target samples mined by HAL using transfer-ability and uncertainty criteria. SALAD has three key benefits: (i) it is task-agnostic, and can be applied across various visual tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection; (ii) it can handle shifts in output label space from the pre-trained source network to the target domain; (iii) it does not require access to source data for adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments across 3 visual tasks, viz. digits classification (MNIST, SVHN, VISDA), synthetic (GTA5) to real (CityScapes) image segmentation, and document layout detection (PubLayNet to DSSE). We show that our source-free approach, SALAD, results in an improvement of 0.5%-31.3%(across datasets and tasks) over prior adaptation methods that assume access to large amounts of annotated source data for adaptation."
2205.12857,Structure Unbiased Adversarial Model for Medical Image Segmentation,"Generative models have been widely proposed in image recognition to generate more images where the distribution is similar to that of the real ones. It often introduces a discriminator network to differentiate the real data from the generated ones. Such models utilise a discriminator network tasked with differentiating style transferred data from data contained in the target dataset. However in doing so the network focuses on discrepancies in the intensity distribution and may overlook structural differences between the datasets. In this paper we formulate a new image-to-image translation problem to ensure that the structure of the generated images is similar to that in the target dataset. We propose a simple, yet powerful Structure-Unbiased Adversarial (SUA) network which accounts for both intensity and structural differences between the training and test sets when performing image segmentation. It consists of a spatial transformation block followed by an intensity distribution rendering module. The spatial transformation block is proposed to reduce the structure gap between the two images, and also produce an inverse deformation field to warp the final segmented image back. The intensity distribution rendering module then renders the deformed structure to an image with the target intensity distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed SUA method has the capability to transfer both intensity distribution and structural content between multiple datasets."
2205.13092,Dual-Perspective Semantic-Aware Representation Blending for Multi-Label   Image Recognition with Partial Labels,"Despite achieving impressive progress, current multi-label image recognition (MLR) algorithms heavily depend on large-scale datasets with complete labels, making collecting large-scale datasets extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. Training the multi-label image recognition models with partial labels (MLR-PL) is an alternative way, in which merely some labels are known while others are unknown for each image. However, current MLP-PL algorithms rely on pre-trained image similarity models or iteratively updating the image classification models to generate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. Thus, they depend on a certain amount of annotations and inevitably suffer from obvious performance drops, especially when the known label proportion is low. To address this dilemma, we propose a dual-perspective semantic-aware representation blending (DSRB) that blends multi-granularity category-specific semantic representation across different images, from instance and prototype perspective respectively, to transfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels. Specifically, an instance-perspective representation blending (IPRB) module is designed to blend the representations of the known labels in an image with the representations of the corresponding unknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. Meanwhile, a prototype-perspective representation blending (PPRB) module is introduced to learn more stable representation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of unknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels, in a location-sensitive manner, to complement these unknown labels. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO, Visual Genome, and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets show that the proposed DSRB consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms on all known label proportion settings."
2205.13147,Matryoshka Representation Learning,"Learned representations are a central component in modern ML systems, serving a multitude of downstream tasks. When training such representations, it is often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each downstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations offer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet), vision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT). MRL code and pretrained models are open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MRL."
2205.13273,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection Using Hypercomplex-Valued   Convolutional Neural Networks,"This paper features convolutional neural networks defined on hypercomplex algebras applied to classify lymphocytes in blood smear digital microscopic images. Such classification is helpful for the diagnosis of acute lymphoblast leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer. We perform the classification task using eight hypercomplex-valued convolutional neural networks (HvCNNs) along with real-valued convolutional networks. Our results show that HvCNNs perform better than the real-valued model, showcasing higher accuracy with a much smaller number of parameters. Moreover, we found that HvCNNs based on Clifford algebras processing HSV-encoded images attained the highest observed accuracies. Precisely, our HvCNN yielded an average accuracy rate of 96.6% using the ALL-IDB2 dataset with a 50% train-test split, a value extremely close to the state-of-the-art models but using a much simpler architecture with significantly fewer parameters."
2205.13542,BEVFusion: Multi-Task Multi-Sensor Fusion with Unified Bird's-Eye View   Representation,"Multi-sensor fusion is essential for an accurate and reliable autonomous driving system. Recent approaches are based on point-level fusion: augmenting the LiDAR point cloud with camera features. However, the camera-to-LiDAR projection throws away the semantic density of camera features, hindering the effectiveness of such methods, especially for semantic-oriented tasks (such as 3D scene segmentation). In this paper, we break this deeply-rooted convention with BEVFusion, an efficient and generic multi-task multi-sensor fusion framework. It unifies multi-modal features in the shared bird's-eye view (BEV) representation space, which nicely preserves both geometric and semantic information. To achieve this, we diagnose and lift key efficiency bottlenecks in the view transformation with optimized BEV pooling, reducing latency by more than 40x. BEVFusion is fundamentally task-agnostic and seamlessly supports different 3D perception tasks with almost no architectural changes. It establishes the new state of the art on nuScenes, achieving 1.3% higher mAP and NDS on 3D object detection and 13.6% higher mIoU on BEV map segmentation, with 1.9x lower computation cost. Code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/bevfusion."
2205.13847,Textural-Perceptual Joint Learning for No-Reference Super-Resolution   Image Quality Assessment,"Image super-resolution (SR) has been widely investigated in recent years. However, it is challenging to fairly estimate the performance of various SR methods, as the lack of reliable and accurate criteria for the perceptual quality. Existing metrics concentrate on the specific kind of degradation without distinguishing the visual sensitive areas, which have no ability to describe the diverse SR degeneration situations in both low-level textural and high-level perceptual information. In this paper, we focus on the textural and perceptual degradation of SR images, and design a dual stream network to jointly explore the textural and perceptual information for quality assessment, dubbed TPNet. By mimicking the human vision system (HVS) that pays more attention to the significant image areas, we develop the spatial attention to make the visual sensitive information more distinguishable and utilize feature normalization (F-Norm) to boost the network representation. Experimental results show the TPNet predicts the visual quality score more accurate than other methods and demonstrates better consistency with the human's perspective. The source code will be available at \url{http://github.com/yuqing-liu-dut/NRIQA_SR}"
2205.14320,RIAV-MVS: Recurrent-Indexing an Asymmetric Volume for Multi-View Stereo,"This paper presents a learning-based method for multi-view depth estimation from posed images. Our core idea is a ""learning-to-optimize"" paradigm that iteratively indexes a plane-sweeping cost volume and regresses the depth map via a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Since the cost volume plays a paramount role in encoding the multi-view geometry, we aim to improve its construction both at pixel- and frame- levels. At the pixel level, we propose to break the symmetry of the Siamese network (which is typically used in MVS to extract image features) by introducing a transformer block to the reference image (but not to the source images). Such an asymmetric volume allows the network to extract global features from the reference image to predict its depth map. Given potential inaccuracies in the poses between reference and source images, we propose to incorporate a residual pose network to correct the relative poses. This essentially rectifies the cost volume at the frame level. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world MVS datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both within-dataset evaluation and cross-dataset generalization. Code available: https://github.com/oppo-us-research/riav-mvs."
2205.14332,V4d: voxel for 4d novel view synthesis,"Neural radiance fields have made a remarkable breakthrough in the novel view synthesis task at the 3D static scene. However, for the 4D circumstance (e.g., dynamic scene), the performance of the existing method is still limited by the capacity of the neural network, typically in a multilayer perceptron network (MLP). In this paper, we utilize 3D Voxel to model the 4D neural radiance field, short as V4D, where the 3D voxel has two formats. The first one is to regularly model the 3D space and then use the sampled local 3D feature with the time index to model the density field and the texture field by a tiny MLP. The second one is in look-up tables (LUTs) format that is for the pixel-level refinement, where the pseudo-surface produced by the volume rendering is utilized as the guidance information to learn a 2D pixel-level refinement mapping. The proposed LUTs-based refinement module achieves the performance gain with little computational cost and could serve as the plug-and-play module in the novel view synthesis task. Moreover, we propose a more effective conditional positional encoding toward the 4D data that achieves performance gain with negligible computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a low computational cost."
2205.14375,WaveMix: A Resource-efficient Neural Network for Image Analysis,"We propose a novel neural architecture for computer vision -- WaveMix -- that is resource-efficient and yet generalizable and scalable. While using fewer trainable parameters, GPU RAM, and computations, WaveMix networks achieve comparable or better accuracy than the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and token mixers for several tasks. This efficiency can translate to savings in time, cost, and energy. To achieve these gains we used multi-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) in WaveMix blocks, which has the following advantages: (1) It reorganizes spatial information based on three strong image priors -- scale-invariance, shift-invariance, and sparseness of edges -- (2) in a lossless manner without adding parameters, (3) while also reducing the spatial sizes of feature maps, which reduces the memory and time required for forward and backward passes, and (4) expanding the receptive field faster than convolutions do. The whole architecture is a stack of self-similar and resolution-preserving WaveMix blocks, which allows architectural flexibility for various tasks and levels of resource availability. WaveMix establishes new benchmarks for segmentation on Cityscapes; and for classification on Galaxy 10 DECals, Places-365, five EMNIST datasets, and iNAT-mini and performs competitively on other benchmarks. Our code and trained models are publicly available."
2205.14444,Visual Superordinate Abstraction for Robust Concept Learning,"Concept learning constructs visual representations that are connected to linguistic semantics, which is fundamental to vision-language tasks. Although promising progress has been made, existing concept learners are still vulnerable to attribute perturbations and out-of-distribution compositions during inference. We ascribe the bottleneck to a failure of exploring the intrinsic semantic hierarchy of visual concepts, e.g. \{red, blue,...\} $\in$ `color' subspace yet cube $\in$ `shape'. In this paper, we propose a visual superordinate abstraction framework for explicitly modeling semantic-aware visual subspaces (i.e. visual superordinates). With only natural visual question answering data, our model first acquires the semantic hierarchy from a linguistic view, and then explores mutually exclusive visual superordinates under the guidance of linguistic hierarchy. In addition, a quasi-center visual concept clustering and a superordinate shortcut learning schemes are proposed to enhance the discrimination and independence of concepts within each visual superordinate. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework under diverse settings, which increases the overall answering accuracy relatively by 7.5\% on reasoning with perturbations and 15.6\% on compositional generalization tests."
2205.14540,SupMAE: Supervised Masked Autoencoders Are Efficient Vision Learners,"Recently, self-supervised Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have attracted unprecedented attention for their impressive representation learning ability. However, the pretext task, Masked Image Modeling (MIM), reconstructs the missing local patches, lacking the global understanding of the image. This paper extends MAE to a fully supervised setting by adding a supervised classification branch, thereby enabling MAE to learn global features from golden labels effectively. The proposed Supervised MAE (SupMAE) only exploits a visible subset of image patches for classification, unlike the standard supervised pre-training where all image patches are used. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SupMAE is not only more training efficient but it also learns more robust and transferable features. Specifically, SupMAE achieves comparable performance with MAE using only 30% of compute when evaluated on ImageNet with the ViT-B/16 model. SupMAE's robustness on ImageNet variants and transfer learning performance outperforms MAE and standard supervised pre-training counterparts. Codes are available at https://github.com/enyac-group/supmae."
2205.14756,EfficientViT: Multi-Scale Linear Attention for High-Resolution Dense   Prediction,"High-resolution dense prediction enables many appealing real-world applications, such as computational photography, autonomous driving, etc. However, the vast computational cost makes deploying state-of-the-art high-resolution dense prediction models on hardware devices difficult. This work presents EfficientViT, a new family of high-resolution vision models with novel multi-scale linear attention. Unlike prior high-resolution dense prediction models that rely on heavy softmax attention, hardware-inefficient large-kernel convolution, or complicated topology structure to obtain good performances, our multi-scale linear attention achieves the global receptive field and multi-scale learning (two desirable features for high-resolution dense prediction) with only lightweight and hardware-efficient operations. As such, EfficientViT delivers remarkable performance gains over previous state-of-the-art models with significant speedup on diverse hardware platforms, including mobile CPU, edge GPU, and cloud GPU. Without performance loss on Cityscapes, our EfficientViT provides up to 13.9$\times$ and 6.2$\times$ GPU latency reduction over SegFormer and SegNeXt, respectively. For super-resolution, EfficientViT delivers up to 6.4x speedup over Restormer while providing 0.11dB gain in PSNR. For Segment Anything, EfficientViT delivers 48.9x higher throughput on A100 GPU while achieving slightly better zero-shot instance segmentation performance on COCO."
2205.14865,Prompt-aligned Gradient for Prompt Tuning,"Thanks to the large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, we can craft a zero-shot classifier by ""prompt"", e.g., the confidence score of an image being ""[CLASS]"" can be obtained by using the VLM provided similarity measure between the image and the prompt sentence ""a photo of a [CLASS]"". Therefore, prompt shows a great potential for fast adaptation of VLMs to downstream tasks if we fine-tune the prompt-based similarity measure. However, we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning may not only undermine the prompt's inherent prediction for the task-related classes, but also for other classes in the VLM vocabulary. Existing methods still address this problem by using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompt. We present Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed ProGrad, to prevent prompt tuning from forgetting the the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, ProGrad only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the ""general direction"", which is represented as the gradient of the KL loss of the pre-defined prompt prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the stronger few-shot generalization ability of ProGrad over state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/BeierZhu/Prompt-align."
2205.15034,Learnable Patchmatch and Self-Teaching for Multi-Frame Depth Estimation   in Monocular Endoscopy,"This work delves into unsupervised monocular depth estimation in endoscopy, which leverages adjacent frames to establish a supervisory signal during the training phase. For many clinical applications, e.g., surgical navigation, temporally correlated frames are also available at test time. Due to the lack of depth clues, making full use of the temporal correlation among multiple video frames at both phases is crucial for accurate depth estimation. However, several challenges in endoscopic scenes, such as low and homogeneous textures and inter-frame brightness fluctuations, limit the performance gain from the temporal correlation. To fully exploit it, we propose a novel unsupervised multi-frame monocular depth estimation model. The proposed model integrates a learnable patchmatch module to adaptively increase the discriminative ability in regions with low and homogeneous textures, and enforces cross-teaching and self-teaching consistencies to provide efficacious regularizations towards brightness fluctuations. Furthermore, as a byproduct of the self-teaching paradigm, the proposed model is able to improve the depth predictions when more frames are input at test time. We conduct detailed experiments on multiple datasets, including SCARED, EndoSLAM, Hamlyn and SERV-CT. The experimental results indicate that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art competitors. The source code and trained models will be publicly available upon the acceptance."
2205.15401,VoGE: A Differentiable Volume Renderer using Gaussian Ellipsoids for   Analysis-by-Synthesis,"The Gaussian reconstruction kernels have been proposed by Westover (1990) and studied by the computer graphics community back in the 90s, which gives an alternative representation of object 3D geometry from meshes and point clouds. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art (SoTA) differentiable renderers, Liu et al. (2019), use rasterization to collect triangles or points on each image pixel and blend them based on the viewing distance. In this paper, we propose VoGE, which utilizes the volumetric Gaussian reconstruction kernels as geometric primitives. The VoGE rendering pipeline uses ray tracing to capture the nearest primitives and blends them as mixtures based on their volume density distributions along the rays. To efficiently render via VoGE, we propose an approximate closeform solution for the volume density aggregation and a coarse-to-fine rendering strategy. Finally, we provide a CUDA implementation of VoGE, which enables real-time level rendering with a competitive rendering speed in comparison to PyTorch3D. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results show VoGE outperforms SoTA counterparts when applied to various vision tasks, e.g., object pose estimation, shape/texture fitting, and occlusion reasoning. The VoGE library and demos are available at: https://github.com/Angtian/VoGE."
2205.15477,Introduction of a tree-based technique for efficient and real-time label   retrieval in the object tracking system,"This paper addresses the issue of the real-time tracking quality of moving objects in large-scale video surveillance systems. During the tracking process, the system assigns an identifier or label to each tracked object to distinguish it from other objects. In such a mission, it is essential to keep this identifier for the same objects, whatever the area, the time of their appearance, or the detecting camera. This is to conserve as much information about the tracking object as possible, decrease the number of ID switching (ID-Sw), and increase the quality of object tracking. To accomplish object labeling, a massive amount of data collected by the cameras must be searched to retrieve the most similar (nearest neighbor) object identifier. Although this task is simple, it becomes very complex in large-scale video surveillance networks, where the data becomes very large. In this case, the label retrieval time increases significantly with this increase, which negatively affects the performance of the real-time tracking system. To avoid such problems, we propose a new solution to automatically label multiple objects for efficient real-time tracking using the indexing mechanism. This mechanism organizes the metadata of the objects extracted during the detection and tracking phase in an Adaptive BCCF-tree. The main advantage of this structure is: its ability to index massive metadata generated by multi-cameras, its logarithmic search complexity, which implicitly reduces the search response time, and its quality of research results, which ensure coherent labeling of the tracked objects. The system load is distributed through a new Internet of Video Things infrastructure-based architecture to improve data processing and real-time object tracking performance. The experimental evaluation was conducted on a publicly available dataset generated by multi-camera containing different crowd activities."
2205.15523,Variational Transfer Learning using Cross-Domain Latent Modulation,"To successfully apply trained neural network models to new domains, powerful transfer learning solutions are essential. We propose to introduce a novel cross-domain latent modulation mechanism to a variational autoencoder framework so as to achieve effective transfer learning. Our key idea is to procure deep representations from one data domain and use it to influence the reparameterization of the latent variable of another domain. Specifically, deep representations of the source and target domains are first extracted by a unified inference model and aligned by employing gradient reversal. The learned deep representations are then cross-modulated to the latent encoding of the alternative domain, where consistency constraints are also applied. In the empirical validation that includes a number of transfer learning benchmark tasks for unsupervised domain adaptation and image-to-image translation, our model demonstrates competitive performance, which is also supported by evidence obtained from visualization."
2205.15747,Adversarial synthesis based data-augmentation for code-switched spoken   language identification,"Spoken Language Identification (LID) is an important sub-task of Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR) that is used to classify the language(s) in an audio segment. Automatic LID plays an useful role in multilingual countries. In various countries, identifying a language becomes hard, due to the multilingual scenario where two or more than two languages are mixed together during conversation. Such phenomenon of speech is called as code-mixing or code-switching. This nature is followed not only in India but also in many Asian countries. Such code-mixed data is hard to find, which further reduces the capabilities of the spoken LID. Hence, this work primarily addresses this problem using data augmentation as a solution on the on the data scarcity of the code-switched class. This study focuses on Indic language code-mixed with English. Spoken LID is performed on Hindi, code-mixed with English. This research proposes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based data augmentation technique performed using Mel spectrograms for audio data. GANs have already been proven to be accurate in representing the real data distribution in the image domain. Proposed research exploits these capabilities of GANs in speech domains such as speech classification, automatic speech recognition, etc. GANs are trained to generate Mel spectrograms of the minority code-mixed class which are then used to augment data for the classifier. Utilizing GANs give an overall improvement on Unweighted Average Recall by an amount of 3.5% as compared to a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) classifier used as the baseline reference."
2205.15862,Snapture -- A Novel Neural Architecture for Combined Static and Dynamic   Hand Gesture Recognition,"As robots are expected to get more involved in people's everyday lives, frameworks that enable intuitive user interfaces are in demand. Hand gesture recognition systems provide a natural way of communication and, thus, are an integral part of seamless Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Recent years have witnessed an immense evolution of computational models powered by deep learning. However, state-of-the-art models fall short in expanding across different gesture domains, such as emblems and co-speech. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid hand gesture recognition system. Our architecture enables learning both static and dynamic gestures: by capturing a so-called ""snapshot"" of the gesture performance at its peak, we integrate the hand pose along with the dynamic movement. Moreover, we present a method for analyzing the motion profile of a gesture to uncover its dynamic characteristics and which allows regulating a static channel based on the amount of motion. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach on two gesture benchmarks compared to a CNNLSTM baseline. We also provide an analysis on a gesture class basis that unveils the potential of our Snapture architecture for performance improvements. Thanks to its modular implementation, our framework allows the integration of other multimodal data like facial expressions and head tracking, which are important cues in HRI scenarios, into one architecture. Thus, our work contributes both to gesture recognition research and machine learning applications for non-verbal communication with robots."
2206.00790,Efficient Self-supervised Vision Pretraining with Local Masked   Reconstruction,"Self-supervised learning for computer vision has achieved tremendous progress and improved many downstream vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach. Our code is publicly available in https://github.com/junchen14/LoMaR."
2206.00798,Multi-scale frequency separation network for image deblurring,"Image deblurring aims to restore the detailed texture information or structures from blurry images, which has become an indispensable step in many computer vision tasks. Although various methods have been proposed to deal with the image deblurring problem, most of them treated the blurry image as a whole and neglected the characteristics of different image frequencies. In this paper, we present a new method called multi-scale frequency separation network (MSFS-Net) for image deblurring. MSFS-Net introduces the frequency separation module (FSM) into an encoder-decoder network architecture to capture the low- and high-frequency information of image at multiple scales. Then, a cycle-consistency strategy and a contrastive learning module (CLM) are respectively designed to retain the low-frequency information and recover the high-frequency information during deblurring. At last, the features of different scales are fused by a cross-scale feature fusion module (CSFFM). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance."
2206.00843,DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware   Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks,"Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/DepthShrinker."
2206.00893,Leveraging Systematic Knowledge of 2D Transformations,"The existing deep learning models suffer from out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) performance drop in computer vision tasks. In comparison, humans have a remarkable ability to interpret images, even if the scenes in the images are rare, thanks to the systematicity of acquired knowledge. This work focuses on 1) the acquisition of systematic knowledge of 2D transformations, and 2) architectural components that can leverage the learned knowledge in image classification tasks in an o.o.d. setting. With a new training methodology based on synthetic datasets that are constructed under the causal framework, the deep neural networks acquire knowledge from semantically different domains (e.g. even from noise), and exhibit certain level of systematicity in parameter estimation experiments. Based on this, a novel architecture is devised consisting of a classifier, an estimator and an identifier (abbreviated as ""CED""). By emulating the ""hypothesis-verification"" process in human visual perception, CED improves the classification accuracy significantly on test sets under covariate shift."
2206.00941,Improving Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems using Manifold   Constraints,"Recently, diffusion models have been used to solve various inverse problems in an unsupervised manner with appropriate modifications to the sampling process. However, the current solvers, which recursively apply a reverse diffusion step followed by a projection-based measurement consistency step, often produce suboptimal results. By studying the generative sampling path, here we show that current solvers throw the sample path off the data manifold, and hence the error accumulates. To address this, we propose an additional correction term inspired by the manifold constraint, which can be used synergistically with the previous solvers to make the iterations close to the manifold. The proposed manifold constraint is straightforward to implement within a few lines of code, yet boosts the performance by a surprisingly large margin. With extensive experiments, we show that our method is superior to the previous methods both theoretically and empirically, producing promising results in many applications such as image inpainting, colorization, and sparse-view computed tomography.

2206.01290,Points2NeRF: Generating Neural Radiance Fields from 3D point cloud,"Contemporary registration devices for 3D visual information, such as LIDARs and various depth cameras, capture data as 3D point clouds. In turn, such clouds are challenging to be processed due to their size and complexity. Existing methods address this problem by fitting a mesh to the point cloud and rendering it instead. This approach, however, leads to the reduced fidelity of the resulting visualization and misses color information of the objects crucial in computer graphics applications. In this work, we propose to mitigate this challenge by representing 3D objects as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We leverage a hypernetwork paradigm and train the model to take a 3D point cloud with the associated color values and return a NeRF network's weights that reconstruct 3D objects from input 2D images. Our method provides efficient 3D object representation and offers several advantages over the existing approaches, including the ability to condition NeRFs and improved generalization beyond objects seen in training. The latter we also confirmed in the results of our empirical evaluation."
2206.01653,Metrics reloaded: Recommendations for image analysis validation,"Increasing evidence shows that flaws in machine learning (ML) algorithm validation are an underestimated global problem. Particularly in automatic biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, our large international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics. Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was developed in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of a problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain interest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm output. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that can be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level, namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of access to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the most common validation metrics. The broad applicability of our framework across domains is demonstrated by an instantiation for various biological and medical image analysis use cases."
2206.01863,Recursive Deformable Image Registration Network with Mutual Attention,"Deformable image registration, estimating the spatial transformation between different images, is an important task in medical imaging. Many previous studies have used learning-based methods for multi-stage registration to perform 3D image registration to improve performance. The performance of the multi-stage approach, however, is limited by the size of the receptive field where complex motion does not occur at a single spatial scale. We propose a new registration network combining recursive network architecture and mutual attention mechanism to overcome these limitations. Compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, our network based on the recursive structure achieves the highest accuracy in lung Computed Tomography (CT) data set (Dice score of 92\% and average surface distance of 3.8mm for lungs) and one of the most accurate results in abdominal CT data set with 9 organs of various sizes (Dice score of 55\% and average surface distance of 7.8mm). We also showed that adding 3 recursive networks is sufficient to achieve the state-of-the-art results without a significant increase in the inference time."
2206.02061,Low Power Neuromorphic EMG Gesture Classification,"EMG (Electromyograph) signal based gesture recognition can prove vital for applications such as smart wearables and bio-medical neuro-prosthetic control. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for low-power, real-time EMG gesture recognition, owing to their inherent spike/event driven spatio-temporal dynamics. In literature, there are limited demonstrations of neuromorphic hardware implementation (at full chip/board/system scale) for EMG gesture classification. Moreover, most literature attempts exploit primitive SNNs based on LIF (Leaky Integrate and Fire) neurons. In this work, we address the aforementioned gaps with following key contributions: (1) Low-power, high accuracy demonstration of EMG-signal based gesture recognition using neuromorphic Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNN). In particular, we propose a multi-time scale recurrent neuromorphic system based on special double-exponential adaptive threshold (DEXAT) neurons. Our network achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy (90%) while using ~53% lesser neurons than best reported prior art on Roshambo EMG dataset. (2) A new multi-channel spike encoder scheme for efficient processing of real-valued EMG data on neuromorphic systems. (3) Unique multi-compartment methodology to implement complex adaptive neurons on Intel's dedicated neuromorphic Loihi chip is shown. (4) RSNN implementation on Loihi (Nahuku 32) achieves significant energy/latency benefits of ~983X/19X compared to GPU for batch size as 50."
2206.02234,Two Decades of Bengali Handwritten Digit Recognition: A Survey,"Handwritten Digit Recognition (HDR) is one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Irrespective of language, there are some inherent challenges of HDR, which mostly arise due to the variations in writing styles across individuals, writing medium and environment, inability to maintain the same strokes while writing any digit repeatedly, etc. In addition to that, the structural complexities of the digits of a particular language may lead to ambiguous scenarios of HDR. Over the years, researchers have developed numerous offline and online HDR pipelines, where different image processing techniques are combined with traditional Machine Learning (ML)-based and/or Deep Learning (DL)-based architectures. Although evidence of extensive review studies on HDR exists in the literature for languages, such as English, Arabic, Indian, Farsi, Chinese, etc., few surveys on Bengali HDR (BHDR) can be found, which lack a comprehensive analysis of the challenges, the underlying recognition process, and possible future directions. In this paper, the characteristics and inherent ambiguities of Bengali handwritten digits along with a comprehensive insight of two decades of state-of-the-art datasets and approaches towards offline BHDR have been analyzed. Furthermore, several real-life application-specific studies, which involve BHDR, have also been discussed in detail. This paper will also serve as a compendium for researchers interested in the science behind offline BHDR, instigating the exploration of newer avenues of relevant research that may further lead to better offline recognition of Bengali handwritten digits in different application areas."
2206.02286,AugLoss: A Robust Augmentation-based Fine Tuning Methodology,"Deep Learning (DL) models achieve great successes in many domains. However, DL models increasingly face safety and robustness concerns, including noisy labeling in the training stage and feature distribution shifts in the testing stage. Previous works made significant progress in addressing these problems, but the focus has largely been on developing solutions for only one problem at a time. For example, recent work has argued for the use of tunable robust loss functions to mitigate label noise, and data augmentation (e.g., AugMix) to combat distribution shifts. As a step towards addressing both problems simultaneously, we introduce AugLoss, a simple but effective methodology that achieves robustness against both train-time noisy labeling and test-time feature distribution shifts by unifying data augmentation and robust loss functions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in varied settings of real-world dataset corruption to showcase the gains achieved by AugLoss compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we hope this work will open new directions for designing more robust and reliable DL models under real-world corruptions."
2206.02327,JigsawHSI: a network for Hyperspectral Image classification,"This article describes Jigsaw, a convolutional neural network (CNN) used in geosciences and based on Inception but tailored for geoscientific analyses. Introduces JigsawHSI (based on Jigsaw) and uses it on the land-use land-cover (LULC) classification problem with the Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas hyperspectral image data sets. The network is compared against HybridSN, a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by 2D-CNN that achieves state-of-the-art results on the datasets. This short article proves that JigsawHSI is able to meet or exceed HybridSN's performance in all three cases. It also introduces a generalized Jigsaw architecture in d-dimensional space for any number of multimodal inputs. Additionally, the use of jigsaw in geosciences is highlighted, while the code and toolkit are made available."
2206.02424,Slim-neck by GSConv: A lightweight-design for real-time detector   architectures,"Real-time object detection is significant for industrial and research fields. On edge devices, a giant model is difficult to achieve the real-time detecting requirement and a lightweight model built from a large number of the depth-wise separable convolutional could not achieve the sufficient accuracy. We introduce a new lightweight convolutional technique, GSConv, to lighten the model but maintain the accuracy. The GSConv accomplishes an excellent trade-off between the accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we provide a design suggestion based on the GSConv, Slim-Neck (SNs), to achieve a higher computational cost-effectiveness of the real-time detectors. The effectiveness of the SNs was robustly demonstrated in over twenty sets comparative experiments. In particular, the real-time detectors of ameliorated by the SNs obtain the state-of-the-art (70.9% AP50 for the SODA10M at a speed of ~ 100FPS on a Tesla T4) compared with the baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/alanli1997/slim-neck-by-gsconv"
2206.02619,VPIT: Real-time Embedded Single Object 3D Tracking Using Voxel Pseudo   Images,"In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) method called Voxel Pseudo Image Tracking (VPIT). VPIT is the first method that uses voxel pseudo images for 3D SOT. The input point cloud is structured by pillar-based voxelization, and the resulting pseudo image is used as an input to a 2D-like Siamese SOT method. The pseudo image is created in the Bird's-eye View (BEV) coordinates, and therefore the objects in it have constant size. Thus, only the object rotation can change in the new coordinate system and not the object scale. For this reason, we replace multi-scale search with a multi-rotation search, where differently rotated search regions are compared against a single target representation to predict both position and rotation of the object. Experiments on KITTI Tracking dataset show that VPIT is the fastest 3D SOT method and maintains competitive Success and Precision values. Application of a SOT method in a real-world scenario meets with limitations such as lower computational capabilities of embedded devices and a latency-unforgiving environment, where the method is forced to skip certain data frames if the inference speed is not high enough. We implement a real-time evaluation protocol and show that other methods lose most of their performance on embedded devices, while VPIT maintains its ability to track the object."
2206.02717,Scene Aware Person Image Generation through Global Contextual   Conditioning,"Person image generation is an intriguing yet challenging problem. However, this task becomes even more difficult under constrained situations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline to generate and insert contextually relevant person images into an existing scene while preserving the global semantics. More specifically, we aim to insert a person such that the location, pose, and scale of the person being inserted blends in with the existing persons in the scene. Our method uses three individual networks in a sequential pipeline. At first, we predict the potential location and the skeletal structure of the new person by conditioning a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) on the existing human skeletons present in the scene. Next, the predicted skeleton is refined through a shallow linear network to achieve higher structural accuracy in the generated image. Finally, the target image is generated from the refined skeleton using another generative network conditioned on a given image of the target person. In our experiments, we achieve high-resolution photo-realistic generation results while preserving the general context of the scene. We conclude our paper with multiple qualitative and quantitative benchmarks on the results."
2206.02997,TadML: A fast temporal action detection with Mechanics-MLP,"Temporal Action Detection(TAD) is a crucial but challenging task in video understanding.It is aimed at detecting both the type and start-end frame for each action instance in a long, untrimmed video.Most current models adopt both RGB and Optical-Flow streams for the TAD task. Thus, original RGB frames must be converted manually into Optical-Flow frames with additional computation and time cost, which is an obstacle to achieve real-time processing. At present, many models adopt two-stage strategies, which would slow the inference speed down and complicatedly tuning on proposals generating.By comparison, we propose a one-stage anchor-free temporal localization method with RGB stream only, in which a novel Newtonian Mechanics-MLP architecture is established. It has comparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art models, while surpasses the inference speed of these methods by a large margin. The typical inference speed in this paper is astounding 4.44 video per second on THUMOS14. In applications, because there is no need to convert optical flow, the inference speed will be faster.It also proves that MLP has great potential in downstream tasks such as TAD.

2206.03010,MS-RNN: A Flexible Multi-Scale Framework for Spatiotemporal Predictive   Learning,"Spatiotemporal predictive learning, which predicts future frames through historical prior knowledge with the aid of deep learning, is widely used in many fields. Previous work essentially improves the model performance by widening or deepening the network, but it also brings surging memory overhead, which seriously hinders the development and application of this technology. In order to improve the performance without increasing memory consumption, we focus on scale, which is another dimension to improve model performance but with low memory requirement. The effectiveness has been widely demonstrated in many CNN-based tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation, but it has not been fully explored in recent RNN models. In this paper, learning from the benefit of multi-scale, we propose a general framework named Multi-Scale RNN (MS-RNN) to boost recent RNN models for spatiotemporal predictive learning. We verify the MS-RNN framework by thorough theoretical analyses and exhaustive experiments, where the theory focuses on memory reduction and performance improvement while the experiments employ eight RNN models (ConvLSTM, TrajGRU, PredRNN, PredRNN++, MIM, MotionRNN, PredRNN-V2, and PrecipLSTM) and four datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, KTH, and Germany). The results show the efficiency that RNN models incorporating our framework have much lower memory cost but better performance than before. Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/mazhf/MS-RNN}."
2206.03111,Medical Image Registration via Neural Fields,"Image registration is an essential step in many medical image analysis tasks. Traditional methods for image registration are primarily optimization-driven, finding the optimal deformations that maximize the similarity between two images. Recent learning-based methods, trained to directly predict transformations between two images, run much faster, but suffer from performance deficiencies due to model generalization and the inefficiency in handling individual image specific deformations. Here we present a new neural net based image registration framework, called NIR (Neural Image Registration), which is based on optimization but utilizes deep neural nets to model deformations between image pairs. NIR represents the transformation between two images with a continuous function implemented via neural fields, receiving a 3D coordinate as input and outputting the corresponding deformation vector. NIR provides two ways of generating deformation field: directly output a displacement vector field for general deformable registration, or output a velocity vector field and integrate the velocity field to derive the deformation field for diffeomorphic image registration. The optimal registration is discovered by updating the parameters of the neural field via stochastic gradient descent. We describe several design choices that facilitate model optimization, including coordinate encoding, sinusoidal activation, coordinate sampling, and intensity sampling. Experiments on two 3D MR brain scan datasets demonstrate that NIR yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of both registration accuracy and regularity, while running significantly faster than traditional optimization-based methods."
2206.03361,Hierarchical Similarity Learning for Aliasing Suppression Image   Super-Resolution,"As a highly ill-posed issue, single image super-resolution (SISR) has been widely investigated in recent years. The main task of SISR is to recover the information loss caused by the degradation procedure. According to the Nyquist sampling theory, the degradation leads to aliasing effect and makes it hard to restore the correct textures from low-resolution (LR) images. In practice, there are correlations and self-similarities among the adjacent patches in the natural images. This paper considers the self-similarity and proposes a hierarchical image super-resolution network (HSRNet) to suppress the influence of aliasing. We consider the SISR issue in the optimization perspective, and propose an iterative solution pattern based on the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) method. To explore the texture with local image prior, we design a hierarchical exploration block (HEB) and progressive increase the receptive field. Furthermore, multi-level spatial attention (MSA) is devised to obtain the relations of adjacent feature and enhance the high-frequency information, which acts as a crucial role for visual experience. Experimental result shows HSRNet achieves better quantitative and visual performance than other works, and remits the aliasing more effectively."
2206.03678,Ultra-High-Definition Image Deblurring via Multi-scale Cubic-Mixer,"Currently, transformer-based algorithms are making a splash in the domain of image deblurring. Their achievement depends on the self-attention mechanism with CNN stem to model long range dependencies between tokens. Unfortunately, this ear-pleasing pipeline introduces high computational complexity and makes it difficult to run an ultra-high-definition image on a single GPU in real time. To trade-off accuracy and efficiency, the input degraded image is computed cyclically over three dimensional ($C$, $W$, and $H$) signals without a self-attention mechanism. We term this deep network as Multi-scale Cubic-Mixer, which is acted on both the real and imaginary components after fast Fourier transform to estimate the Fourier coefficients and thus obtain a deblurred image. Furthermore, we combine the multi-scale cubic-mixer with a slicing strategy to generate high-quality results at a much lower computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deblurring approaches on the several benchmarks and a new ultra-high-definition dataset in terms of accuracy and speed."
2206.03709,Hypernetwork-based Personalized Federated Learning for   Multi-Institutional CT Imaging,"Computed tomography (CT) is of great importance in clinical practice due to its powerful ability to provide patients' anatomical information without any invasive inspection, but its potential radiation risk is raising people's concerns. Deep learning-based methods are considered promising in CT reconstruction, but these network models are usually trained with the measured data obtained from specific scanning protocol and need to centralizedly collect large amounts of data, which will lead to serious data domain shift, and privacy concerns. To relieve these problems, in this paper, we propose a hypernetwork-based federated learning method for personalized CT imaging, dubbed as HyperFed. The basic assumption of HyperFed is that the optimization problem for each institution can be divided into two parts: the local data adaption problem and the global CT imaging problem, which are implemented by an institution-specific hypernetwork and a global-sharing imaging network, respectively. The purpose of global-sharing imaging network is to learn stable and effective common features from different institutions. The institution-specific hypernetwork is carefully designed to obtain hyperparameters to condition the global-sharing imaging network for personalized local CT reconstruction. Experiments show that HyperFed achieves competitive performance in CT reconstruction compared with several other state-of-the-art methods. It is believed as a promising direction to improve CT imaging quality and achieve personalized demands of different institutions or scanners without privacy data sharing. The codes will be released at https://github.com/Zi-YuanYang/HyperFed."
2206.04406,Unsupervised Learning of the Total Variation Flow,"The total variation (TV) flow generates a scale-space representation of an image based on the TV functional. This gradient flow observes desirable features for images, such as sharp edges and enables spectral, scale, and texture analysis. Solving the TV flow is challenging; one reason is the the non-uniqueness of the subgradients. The standard numerical approach for TV flow requires solving multiple non-smooth optimisation problems. Even with state-of-the-art convex optimisation techniques, this is often prohibitively expensive and strongly motivates the use of alternative, faster approaches. Inspired by and extending the framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we propose the TVflowNET, an unsupervised neural network approach, to approximate the solution of the TV flow given an initial image and a time instance. The TVflowNET requires no ground truth data but rather makes use of the PDE for optimisation of the network parameters. We circumvent the challenges related to the non-uniqueness of the subgradients by additionally learning the related diffusivity term. Our approach significantly speeds up the computation time and we show that the TVflowNET approximates the TV flow solution with high fidelity for different image sizes and image types. Additionally, we give a full comparison of different network architecture designs as well as training regimes to underscore the effectiveness of our approach."
2206.04548,Classification of COVID-19 in Chest X-ray Images Using Fusion of Deep   Features and LightGBM,"The COVID-19 disease was first discovered in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly worldwide. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have begun to identify a way to diagnose the COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. The early diagnosis of this disease can significantly impact the treatment process. In this article, we propose a new technique that is faster and more accurate than the other methods reported in the literature. The proposed method uses a combination of DenseNet169 and MobileNet Deep Neural Networks to extract the features of the patient's X-ray images. Using the univariate feature selection algorithm, we refined the features for the most important ones. Then we applied the selected features as input to the LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) algorithm for classification. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, the ChestX-ray8 dataset, which includes 1125 X-ray images of the patient's chest, was used. The proposed method achieved 98.54% and 91.11% accuracies in the two-class (COVID-19, Healthy) and multi-class (COVID-19, Healthy, Pneumonia) classification problems, respectively. It is worth mentioning that we have used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for further analysis."
2206.04846,Masked Autoencoders are Robust Data Augmentors,"Deep neural networks are capable of learning powerful representations to tackle complex vision tasks but expose undesirable properties like the over-fitting issue. To this end, regularization techniques like image augmentation are necessary for deep neural networks to generalize well. Nevertheless, most prevalent image augmentation recipes confine themselves to off-the-shelf linear transformations like scale, flip, and colorjitter. Due to their hand-crafted property, these augmentations are insufficient to generate truly hard augmented examples. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective of augmentation to regularize the training process. Inspired by the recent success of applying masked image modeling to self-supervised learning, we adopt the self-supervised masked autoencoder to generate the distorted view of the input images. We show that utilizing such model-based nonlinear transformation as data augmentation can improve high-level recognition tasks. We term the proposed method as \textbf{M}ask-\textbf{R}econstruct \textbf{A}ugmentation (MRA). The extensive experiments on various image classification benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation. Specifically, MRA consistently enhances the performance on supervised, semi-supervised as well as few-shot classification."
2206.04877,Convex Hull Prediction for Adaptive Video Streaming by Recurrent   Learning,"Adaptive video streaming relies on the construction of efficient bitrate ladders to deliver the best possible visual quality to viewers under bandwidth constraints. The traditional method of content dependent bitrate ladder selection requires a video shot to be pre-encoded with multiple encoding parameters to find the optimal operating points given by the convex hull of the resulting rate-quality curves. However, this pre-encoding step is equivalent to an exhaustive search process over the space of possible encoding parameters, which causes significant overhead in terms of both computation and time expenditure. To reduce this overhead, we propose a deep learning based method of content aware convex hull prediction. We employ a recurrent convolutional network (RCN) to implicitly analyze the spatiotemporal complexity of video shots in order to predict their convex hulls. A two-step transfer learning scheme is adopted to train our proposed RCN-Hull model, which ensures sufficient content diversity to analyze scene complexity, while also making it possible to capture the scene statistics of pristine source videos. Our experimental results reveal that our proposed model yields better approximations of the optimal convex hulls, and offers competitive time savings as compared to existing approaches. On average, the pre-encoding time was reduced by 53.8% by our method, while the average Bjontegaard delta bitrate (BD-rate) of the predicted convex hulls against ground truth was 0.26%, and the mean absolute deviation of the BD-rate distribution was 0.57%."
2206.05288,From Labels to Priors in Capsule Endoscopy: A Prior Guided Approach for   Improving Generalization with Few Labels,"The lack of generalizability of deep learning approaches for the automated diagnosis of pathologies in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has prevented any significant advantages from trickling down to real clinical practices. As a result, disease management using WCE continues to depend on exhaustive manual investigations by medical experts. This explains its limited use despite several advantages. Prior works have considered using higher quality and quantity of labels as a way of tackling the lack of generalization, however this is hardly scalable considering pathology diversity not to mention that labeling large datasets encumbers the medical staff additionally. We propose using freely available domain knowledge as priors to learn more robust and generalizable representations. We experimentally show that domain priors can benefit representations by acting in proxy of labels, thereby significantly reducing the labeling requirement while still enabling fully unsupervised yet pathology-aware learning. We use the contrastive objective along with prior-guided views during pretraining, where the view choices inspire sensitivity to pathological information. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method performs better than (or closes gap with) the state-of-the-art in the domain, establishing a new benchmark in pathology classification and cross-dataset generalization, as well as scaling to unseen pathology categories."
2206.05289,Localized adversarial artifacts for compressed sensing MRI,"As interest in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image reconstruction tasks grows, their reliability has been called into question (Antun et al., 2020; Gottschling et al., 2020). However, recent work has shown that, compared to total variation (TV) minimization, when appropriately regularized, DNNs show similar robustness to adversarial noise in terms of $\ell^2$-reconstruction error (Genzel et al., 2022). We consider a different notion of robustness, using the $\ell^\infty$-norm, and argue that localized reconstruction artifacts are a more relevant defect than the $\ell^2$-error. We create adversarial perturbations to undersampled magnetic resonance imaging measurements (in the frequency domain) which induce severe localized artifacts in the TV-regularized reconstruction. Notably, the same attack method is not as effective against DNN based reconstruction. Finally, we show that this phenomenon is inherent to reconstruction methods for which exact recovery can be guaranteed, as with compressed sensing reconstructions with $\ell^1$- or TV-minimization."
2206.05390,Overcoming Annotation Bottlenecks in Underwater Fish Segmentation: A   Robust Self-Supervised Learning Approach,"Accurate fish segmentation in underwater videos is challenging due to low visibility, variable lighting, and dynamic backgrounds, making fully-supervised methods that require manual annotation impractical for many applications. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning approach for fish segmentation using Deep Learning. Our model, trained without manual annotation, learns robust and generalizable representations by aligning features across augmented views and enforcing spatial-temporal consistency. We demonstrate its effectiveness on three challenging underwater video datasets: DeepFish, Seagrass, and YouTube-VOS, surpassing existing self-supervised methods and achieving segmentation accuracy comparable to fully-supervised methods without the need for costly annotations. Trained on DeepFish, our model exhibits strong generalization, achieving high segmentation accuracy on the unseen Seagrass and YouTube-VOS datasets. Furthermore, our model is computationally efficient due to its parallel processing and efficient anchor sampling technique, making it suitable for real-time applications and potential deployment on edge devices. We present quantitative results using Jaccard Index and Dice coefficient, as well as qualitative comparisons, showcasing the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach for advancing underwater video analysis"
2206.05516,Deep Learning-Based MR Image Re-parameterization,"Magnetic resonance (MR) image re-parameterization refers to the process of generating via simulations of an MR image with a new set of MRI scanning parameters. Different parameter values generate distinct contrast between different tissues, helping identify pathologic tissue. Typically, more than one scan is required for diagnosis; however, acquiring repeated scans can be costly, time-consuming, and difficult for patients. Thus, using MR image re-parameterization to predict and estimate the contrast in these imaging scans can be an effective alternative. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) based convolutional model for MRI re-parameterization. Based on our preliminary results, DL-based techniques hold the potential to learn the non-linearities that govern the re-parameterization."
2206.05625,Exploring the Intersection between Neural Architecture Search and   Continual Learning,"Despite the significant advances achieved in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their design process remains notoriously tedious, depending primarily on intuition, experience and trial-and-error. This human-dependent process is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Furthermore, the models are generally bound to their training contexts, with no considerations to their surrounding environments. Continual adaptiveness and automation of neural networks is of paramount importance to several domains where model accessibility is limited after deployment (e.g IoT devices, self-driving vehicles, etc.). Additionally, even accessible models require frequent maintenance post-deployment to overcome issues such as Concept/Data Drift, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. By leveraging and combining approaches from Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Continual Learning (CL), more robust and adaptive agents can be developed. This study conducts the first extensive review on the intersection between NAS and CL, formalizing the prospective Continually-Adaptive Neural Networks (CANNs) paradigm and outlining research directions for lifelong autonomous ANNs."
2206.05647,A Fast Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Coded Aperture Snapshot   Spectral Imaging Based on Sparsity and Deep Image Priors,"Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) is a technique used to reconstruct three-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs) from one or several two-dimensional projection measurements. However, fewer projection measurements or more spectral channels leads to a severly ill-posed problem, in which case regularization methods have to be applied. In order to significantly improve the accuracy of reconstruction, this paper proposes a fast alternating minimization algorithm based on the sparsity and deep image priors (Fama-SDIP) of natural images. By integrating deep image prior (DIP) into the principle of compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction, the proposed algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art results without any training dataset. Extensive experiments show that Fama-SDIP method significantly outperforms prevailing leading methods on simulation and real HSI datasets."
2206.05730,Adding New Categories in Object Detection Using Few-Shot Copy-Paste,"Developing data-efficient instance detection models that can handle rare object categories remains a key challenge in computer vision. However, existing research often overlooks data collection strategies and evaluation metrics tailored to real-world scenarios involving neural networks. In this study, we systematically investigate data collection and augmentation techniques focused on object occlusion, aiming to mimic occlusion relationships observed in practical applications. Surprisingly, we find that even a simple occlusion mechanism is sufficient to achieve strong performance when introducing new object categories. Notably, by adding just 15 images of a new category to a large-scale training dataset containing over half a million images across hundreds of categories, the model achieves 95\% accuracy on an unseen test set with thousands of instances of the new category."
2206.05751,Consistent Attack: Universal Adversarial Perturbation on Embodied Vision Navigation,"Embodied agents in vision navigation coupled with deep neural networks have attracted increasing attention. However, deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to malicious adversarial noises, which may potentially cause catastrophic failures in Embodied Vision Navigation. Among different adversarial noises, universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), i.e., a constant image-agnostic perturbation applied on every input frame of the agent, play a critical role in Embodied Vision Navigation since they are computation-efficient and application-practical during the attack. However, existing UAP methods ignore the system dynamics of Embodied Vision Navigation and might be sub-optimal. In order to extend UAP to the sequential decision setting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise $\delta$, as a $\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\delta$-MDP). Based on the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\delta$-MDP and propose two novel Consistent Attack methods, named Reward UAP and Trajectory UAP, for attacking Embodied agents, which consider the dynamic of the MDP and calculate universal noises by estimating the disturbed distribution and the disturbed Q function. For various victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a significant drop in their performance in the PointGoal task in Habitat with different datasets and different scenes. Extensive experimental results indicate that there exist serious potential risks for applying Embodied Vision Navigation methods to the real world."
2206.05927,LinK3D: Linear Keypoints Representation for 3D LiDAR Point Cloud,"Feature extraction and matching are the basic parts of many robotic vision tasks, such as 2D or 3D object detection, recognition, and registration. As is known, 2D feature extraction and matching have already achieved great success. Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods may fail to support the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in robotic vision tasks due to their poor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D LiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully considers the characteristics (such as the sparsity and complexity) of LiDAR point clouds and represents the keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints, which provide strong constraints in the description of the keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on three public datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves great matching performance. More importantly, LinK3D also shows excellent real-time performance, faster than the sensor frame rate at 10 Hz of a typical rotating LiDAR sensor. LinK3D only takes an average of 30 milliseconds to extract features from the point cloud collected by a 64-beam LiDAR and takes merely about 20 milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed on a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor. Moreover, our method can be extended to LiDAR odometry task, and shows good scalability. We release the implementation of our method at https://github.com/YungeCui/LinK3D."
2206.06267,MMMNA-Net for Overall Survival Time Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients,"Overall survival (OS) time is one of the most important evaluation indices for gliomas situations. Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans play an important role in the study of glioma prognosis OS time. Several deep learning-based methods are proposed for the OS time prediction on multi-modal MRI problems. However, these methods usually fuse multi-modal information at the beginning or at the end of the deep learning networks and lack the fusion of features from different scales. In addition, the fusion at the end of networks always adapts global with global (eg. fully connected after concatenation of global average pooling output) or local with local (eg. bilinear pooling), which loses the information of local with global. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-modal OS time prediction of brain tumor patients, which contains an improved nonlocal features fusion module introduced on different scales. Our method obtains a relative 8.76% improvement over the current state-of-art method (0.6989 vs. 0.6426 on accuracy). Extensive testing demonstrates that our method could adapt to situations with missing modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/TangWen920812/mmmna-net."
2206.06420,GraphMLP: A Graph MLP-Like Architecture for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Modern multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models have shown competitive results in learning visual representations without self-attention. However, existing MLP models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of human body configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific demand of the 3D human pose, while allowing for both local and global spatial interactions. Furthermore, we propose to flexibly and efficiently extend the GraphMLP to the video domain and show that complex temporal dynamics can be effectively modeled in a simple way with negligible computational cost gains in the sequence length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MLP-Like architecture for 3D human pose estimation in a single frame and a video sequence. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GraphMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Vegetebird/GraphMLP."
2206.06577,Physics Informed Neural Fields for Smoke Reconstruction with Sparse Data,"High-fidelity reconstruction of fluids from sparse multiview RGB videos remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the underlying physics as well as complex occlusion and lighting in captures. Existing solutions either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics (ie, Navier -Stokes equations) in an end-to-end optimization from sparse videos without taking lighting conditions, geometry information, or boundary conditions as input. We provide a continuous spatio-temporal scene representation using neural networks as the ansatz of density and velocity solution functions for fluids as well as the radiance field for static objects. With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid interactions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without additional geometry input or human labeling. By augmenting time-varying neural radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization from sparse views, we introduced a layer-by-layer growing strategy to progressively increase the network capacity. Using progressively growing models with a new regularization term, we manage to disentangle density-color ambiguity in radiance fields without overfitting. A pretrained density-to-velocity fluid model is leveraged in addition as the data prior to avoid suboptimal velocity which underestimates vorticity but trivially fulfills physical equations. Our method exhibits high-quality results with relaxed constraints and strong flexibility on a representative set of synthetic and real flow captures."
2206.06694,ISLES 2022: A multi-center magnetic resonance imaging stroke lesion   segmentation dataset,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a central modality for stroke imaging. It is used upon patient admission to make treatment decisions such as selecting patients for intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular therapy. MRI is later used in the duration of hospital stay to predict outcome by visualizing infarct core size and location. Furthermore, it may be used to characterize stroke etiology, e.g. differentiation between (cardio)-embolic and non-embolic stroke. Computer based automated medical image processing is increasingly finding its way into clinical routine. Previous iterations of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge have aided in the generation of identifying benchmark methods for acute and sub-acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation. Here we introduce an expert-annotated, multicenter MRI dataset for segmentation of acute to subacute stroke lesions. This dataset comprises 400 multi-vendor MRI cases with high variability in stroke lesion size, quantity and location. It is split into a training dataset of n=250 and a test dataset of n=150. All training data will be made publicly available. The test dataset will be used for model validation only and will not be released to the public. This dataset serves as the foundation of the ISLES 2022 challenge with the goal of finding algorithmic methods to enable the development and benchmarking of robust and accurate segmentation algorithms for ischemic stroke."
2206.06854,On the explainable properties of 1-Lipschitz Neural Networks: An Optimal   Transport Perspective,"Input gradients have a pivotal role in a variety of applications, including adversarial attack algorithms for evaluating model robustness, explainable AI techniques for generating Saliency Maps, and counterfactual explanations.However, Saliency Maps generated by traditional neural networks are often noisy and provide limited insights. In this paper, we demonstrate that, on the contrary, the Saliency Maps of 1-Lipschitz neural networks, learned with the dual loss of an optimal transportation problem, exhibit desirable XAI properties:They are highly concentrated on the essential parts of the image with low noise, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art explanation approaches across various models and metrics. We also prove that these maps align unprecedentedly well with human explanations on ImageNet.To explain the particularly beneficial properties of the Saliency Map for such models, we prove this gradient encodes both the direction of the transportation plan and the direction towards the nearest adversarial attack. Following the gradient down to the decision boundary is no longer considered an adversarial attack, but rather a counterfactual explanation that explicitly transports the input from one class to another. Thus, Learning with such a loss jointly optimizes the classification objective and the alignment of the gradient, i.e. the Saliency Map, to the transportation plan direction.These networks were previously known to be certifiably robust by design, and we demonstrate that they scale well for large problems and models, and are tailored for explainability using a fast and straightforward method."
2206.07282,Human Eyes Inspired Recurrent Neural Networks are More Robust Against   Adversarial Noises,"Humans actively observe the visual surroundings by focusing on salient objects and ignoring trivial details. However, computer vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) often analyze visual input all at once through a single feed-forward pass. In this study, we designed a dual-stream vision model inspired by the human brain. This model features retina-like input layers and includes two streams: one determining the next point of focus (the fixation), while the other interprets the visuals surrounding the fixation. Trained on image recognition, this model examines an image through a sequence of fixations, each time focusing on different parts, thereby progressively building a representation of the image. We evaluated this model against various benchmarks in terms of object recognition, gaze behavior and adversarial robustness. Our findings suggest that the model can attend and gaze in ways similar to humans without being explicitly trained to mimic human attention, and that the model can enhance robustness against adversarial attacks due to its retinal sampling and recurrent processing. In particular, the model can correct its perceptual errors by taking more glances, setting itself apart from all feed-forward-only models. In conclusion, the interactions of retinal sampling, eye movement, and recurrent dynamics are important to human-like visual exploration and inference."
2206.07298,S$^2$-FPN: Scale-ware Strip Attention Guided Feature Pyramid Network for   Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Modern high-performance semantic segmentation methods employ a heavy backbone and dilated convolution to extract the relevant feature. Although extracting features with both contextual and semantic information is critical for the segmentation tasks, it brings a memory footprint and high computation cost for real-time applications. This paper presents a new model to achieve a trade-off between accuracy/speed for real-time road scene semantic segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a lightweight model named Scale-aware Strip Attention Guided Feature Pyramid Network (S$^2$-FPN). Our network consists of three main modules: Attention Pyramid Fusion (APF) module, Scale-aware Strip Attention Module (SSAM), and Global Feature Upsample (GFU) module. APF adopts an attention mechanisms to learn discriminative multi-scale features and help close the semantic gap between different levels. APF uses the scale-aware attention to encode global context with vertical stripping operation and models the long-range dependencies, which helps relate pixels with similar semantic label. In addition, APF employs channel-wise reweighting block (CRB) to emphasize the channel features. Finally, the decoder of S$^2$-FPN then adopts GFU, which is used to fuse features from APF and the encoder. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves better accuracy/speed trade-off with different model settings. The proposed models have achieved a results of 76.2\%mIoU/87.3FPS, 77.4\%mIoU/67FPS, and 77.8\%mIoU/30.5FPS on Cityscapes dataset, and 69.6\%mIoU,71.0\% mIoU, and 74.2\% mIoU on Camvid dataset. The code for this work will be made available at \url{https://github.com/mohamedac29/S2-FPN"
2206.07387,The Manifold Hypothesis for Gradient-Based Explanations,"When do gradient-based explanation algorithms provide perceptually-aligned explanations? We propose a criterion: the feature attributions need to be aligned with the tangent space of the data manifold. To provide evidence for this hypothesis, we introduce a framework based on variational autoencoders that allows to estimate and generate image manifolds. Through experiments across a range of different datasets -- MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR10, X-ray pneumonia and Diabetic Retinopathy detection -- we demonstrate that the more a feature attribution is aligned with the tangent space of the data, the more perceptually-aligned it tends to be. We then show that the attributions provided by popular post-hoc methods such as Integrated Gradients and SmoothGrad are more strongly aligned with the data manifold than the raw gradient. Adversarial training also improves the alignment of model gradients with the data manifold. As a consequence, we suggest that explanation algorithms should actively strive to align their explanations with the data manifold. This is an extended version of a CVPR Workshop paper. Code is available at https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/explanations-manifold."
2206.07705,LET-3D-AP: Longitudinal Error Tolerant 3D Average Precision for   Camera-Only 3D Detection,"The 3D Average Precision (3D AP) relies on the intersection over union between predictions and ground truth objects. However, camera-only detectors have limited depth accuracy, which may cause otherwise reasonable predictions that suffer from such longitudinal localization errors to be treated as false positives. We therefore propose variants of the 3D AP metric to be more permissive with respect to depth estimation errors. Specifically, our novel longitudinal error tolerant metrics, LET-3D-AP and LET-3D-APL, allow longitudinal localization errors of the prediction boxes up to a given tolerance. To evaluate the proposed metrics, we also construct a new test set for the Waymo Open Dataset, tailored to camera-only 3D detection methods. Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art camera-based detectors can outperform popular LiDAR-based detectors with our new metrics past at 10% depth error tolerance, suggesting that existing camera-based detectors already have the potential to surpass LiDAR-based detectors in downstream applications. We believe the proposed metrics and the new benchmark dataset will facilitate advances in the field of camera-only 3D detection by providing more informative signals that can better indicate the system-level performance."
2206.07802,Improving generalization by mimicking the human visual diet,"We present a new perspective on bridging the generalization gap between biological and computer vision -- mimicking the human visual diet. While computer vision models rely on internet-scraped datasets, humans learn from limited 3D scenes under diverse real-world transformations with objects in natural context. Our results demonstrate that incorporating variations and contextual cues ubiquitous in the human visual training data (visual diet) significantly improves generalization to real-world transformations such as lighting, viewpoint, and material changes. This improvement also extends to generalizing from synthetic to real-world data -- all models trained with a human-like visual diet outperform specialized architectures by large margins when tested on natural image data. These experiments are enabled by our two key contributions: a novel dataset capturing scene context and diverse real-world transformations to mimic the human visual diet, and a transformer model tailored to leverage these aspects of the human visual diet. All data and source code can be accessed at https://github.com/Spandan-Madan/human_visual_diet."
2206.08016,Backbones-Review: Feature Extraction Networks for Deep Learning and Deep   Reinforcement Learning Approaches,"To understand the real world using various types of data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most used technique nowadays. While finding the pattern within the analyzed data represents the main task. This is performed by extracting representative features step, which is proceeded using the statistical algorithms or using some specific filters. However, the selection of useful features from large-scale data represented a crucial challenge. Now, with the development of convolution neural networks (CNNs), the feature extraction operation has become more automatic and easier. CNNs allow to work on large-scale size of data, as well as cover different scenarios for a specific task. For computer vision tasks, convolutional networks are used to extract features also for the other parts of a deep learning model. The selection of a suitable network for feature extraction or the other parts of a DL model is not random work. So, the implementation of such a model can be related to the target task as well as the computational complexity of it. Many networks have been proposed and become the famous networks used for any DL models in any AI task. These networks are exploited for feature extraction or at the beginning of any DL model which is named backbones. A backbone is a known network trained in many other tasks before and demonstrates its effectiveness. In this paper, an overview of the existing backbones, e.g. VGGs, ResNets, DenseNet, etc, is given with a detailed description. Also, a couple of computer vision tasks are discussed by providing a review of each task regarding the backbones used. In addition, a comparison in terms of performance is also provided, based on the backbone used for each task."
2206.08219,HaGRID - HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset,"This paper introduces an enormous dataset, HaGRID (HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset), to build a hand gesture recognition (HGR) system concentrating on interaction with devices to manage them. That is why all 18 chosen gestures are endowed with the semiotic function and can be interpreted as a specific action. Although the gestures are static, they were picked up, especially for the ability to design several dynamic gestures. It allows the trained model to recognize not only static gestures such as ""like"" and ""stop"" but also ""swipes"" and ""drag and drop"" dynamic gestures. The HaGRID contains 554,800 images and bounding box annotations with gesture labels to solve hand detection and gesture classification tasks. The low variability in context and subjects of other datasets was the reason for creating the dataset without such limitations. Utilizing crowdsourcing platforms allowed us to collect samples recorded by 37,583 subjects in at least as many scenes with subject-to-camera distances from 0.5 to 4 meters in various natural light conditions. The influence of the diversity characteristics was assessed in ablation study experiments. Also, we demonstrate the HaGRID ability to be used for pretraining models in HGR tasks. The HaGRID and pretrained models are publicly available."
2206.08605,On Efficient Real-Time Semantic Segmentation: A Survey,"Semantic segmentation is the problem of assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, and is an important component of an autonomous vehicle vision stack for facilitating scene understanding and object detection. However, many of the top performing semantic segmentation models are extremely complex and cumbersome, and as such are not suited to deployment onboard autonomous vehicle platforms where computational resources are limited and low-latency operation is a vital requirement. In this survey, we take a thorough look at the works that aim to address this misalignment with more compact and efficient models capable of deployment on low-memory embedded systems while meeting the constraint of real-time inference. We discuss several of the most prominent works in the field, placing them within a taxonomy based on their major contributions, and finally we evaluate the inference speed of the discussed models under consistent hardware and software setups that represent a typical research environment with high-end GPU and a realistic deployed scenario using low-memory embedded GPU hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that many works are capable of real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware, while illustrating the consistent trade-off between latency and accuracy."
2206.08640,Uncertainty-aware Evaluation of Time-Series Classification for Online   Handwriting Recognition with Domain Shift,"For many applications, analyzing the uncertainty of a machine learning model is indispensable. While research of uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques is very advanced for computer vision applications, UQ methods for spatio-temporal data are less studied. In this paper, we focus on models for online handwriting recognition, one particular type of spatio-temporal data. The data is observed from a sensor-enhanced pen with the goal to classify written characters. We conduct a broad evaluation of aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) UQ based on two prominent techniques for Bayesian inference, Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) and Deep Ensembles. Next to a better understanding of the model, UQ techniques can detect out-of-distribution data and domain shifts when combining right-handed and left-handed writers (an underrepresented group)."
2206.08657,BridgeTower: Building Bridges Between Encoders in Vision-Language   Representation Learning,"Vision-Language (VL) models with the Two-Tower architecture have dominated visual-language representation learning in recent years. Current VL models either use lightweight uni-modal encoders and learn to extract, align and fuse both modalities simultaneously in a deep cross-modal encoder, or feed the last-layer uni-modal representations from the deep pre-trained uni-modal encoders into the top cross-modal encoder. Both approaches potentially restrict vision-language representation learning and limit model performance. In this paper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that build a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer of the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal alignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different semantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder. Pre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the VQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training data and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs. Notably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger datasets.

2206.08751,Perceptual Quality Assessment of Virtual Reality Videos in the Wild,"Investigating how people perceive virtual reality (VR) videos in the wild (i.e., those captured by everyday users) is a crucial and challenging task in VR-related applications due to complex authentic distortions localized in space and time. Existing panoramic video databases only consider synthetic distortions, assume fixed viewing conditions, and are limited in size. To overcome these shortcomings, we construct the VR Video Quality in the Wild (VRVQW) database, containing $502$ user-generated videos with diverse content and distortion characteristics. Based on VRVQW, we conduct a formal psychophysical experiment to record the scanpaths and perceived quality scores from $139$ participants under two different viewing conditions. We provide a thorough statistical analysis of the recorded data, observing significant impact of viewing conditions on both human scanpaths and perceived quality. Moreover, we develop an objective quality assessment model for VR videos based on pseudocylindrical representation and convolution. Results on the proposed VRVQW show that our method is superior to existing video quality assessment models. We have made the database and code available at https://github.com/limuhit/VR-Video-Quality-in-the-Wild."
2206.08898,SimA: Simple Softmax-free Attention for Vision Transformers,"Recently, vision transformers have become very popular. However, deploying them in many applications is computationally expensive partly due to the Softmax layer in the attention block. We introduce a simple but effective, Softmax-free attention block, SimA, which normalizes query and key matrices with simple $\ell_1$-norm instead of using Softmax layer. Then, the attention block in SimA is a simple multiplication of three matrices, so SimA can dynamically change the ordering of the computation at the test time to achieve linear computation on the number of tokens or the number of channels. We empirically show that SimA applied to three SOTA variations of transformers, DeiT, XCiT, and CvT, results in on-par accuracy compared to the SOTA models, without any need for Softmax layer. Interestingly, changing SimA from multi-head to single-head has only a small effect on the accuracy, which simplifies the attention block further. The code is available here: https://github.com/UCDvision/sima"
2206.08927,DenseMTL: Cross-task Attention Mechanism for Dense Multi-task Learning,"Multi-task learning has recently emerged as a promising solution for a comprehensive understanding of complex scenes. In addition to being memory-efficient, multi-task models, when appropriately designed, can facilitate the exchange of complementary signals across tasks. In this work, we jointly address 2D semantic segmentation and three geometry-related tasks: dense depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and edge estimation, demonstrating their benefits on both indoor and outdoor datasets. We propose a novel multi-task learning architecture that leverages pairwise cross-task exchange through correlation-guided attention and self-attention to enhance the overall representation learning for all tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across three multi-task setups, showing the advantages of our approach compared to competitive baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Additionally, we extend our method to the novel multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation setting. Our code is available at https://github.com/cv-rits/DenseMTL"
2206.09256,Multistream Gaze Estimation with Anatomical Eye Region Isolation by   Synthetic to Real Transfer Learning,"We propose a novel neural pipeline, MSGazeNet, that learns gaze representations by taking advantage of the eye anatomy information through a multistream framework. Our proposed solution comprises two components, first a network for isolating anatomical eye regions, and a second network for multistream gaze estimation. The eye region isolation is performed with a U-Net style network which we train using a synthetic dataset that contains eye region masks for the visible eyeball and the iris region. The synthetic dataset used in this stage is procured using the UnityEyes simulator, and consists of 80,000 eye images. Successive to training, the eye region isolation network is then transferred to the real domain for generating masks for the real-world eye images. In order to successfully make the transfer, we exploit domain randomization in the training process, which allows for the synthetic images to benefit from a larger variance with the help of augmentations that resemble artifacts. The generated eye region masks along with the raw eye images are then used together as a multistream input to our gaze estimation network, which consists of wide residual blocks. The output embeddings from these encoders are fused in the channel dimension before feeding into the gaze regression layers. We evaluate our framework on three gaze estimation datasets and achieve strong performances. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by 7.57% and 1.85% on two datasets, and obtains competitive results on the other. We also study the robustness of our method with respect to the noise in the data and demonstrate that our model is less sensitive to noisy data. Lastly, we perform a variety of experiments including ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of different components and design choices in our solution."
2206.09325,EATFormer: Improving Vision Transformer Inspired by Evolutionary   Algorithm,"Motivated by biological evolution, this paper explains the rationality of Vision Transformer by analogy with the proven practical evolutionary algorithm (EA) and derives that both have consistent mathematical formulation. Then inspired by effective EA variants, we propose a novel pyramid EATFormer backbone that only contains the proposed EA-based transformer (EAT) block, which consists of three residual parts, i.e., Multi-scale region aggregation, global and local interaction, and feed-forward network modules, to model multi-scale, interactive, and individual information separately. Moreover, we design a task-related head docked with transformer backbone to complete final information fusion more flexibly and improve a modulated deformable MSA to dynamically model irregular locations. Massive quantitative and quantitative experiments on image classification, downstream tasks, and explanatory experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods. E.g., our Mobile (1.8 M), Tiny (6.1 M), Small (24.3 M), and Base (49.0 M) models achieve 69.4, 78.4, 83.1, and 83.9 Top-1 only trained on ImageNet-1K with naive training recipe; EATFormer-Tiny/Small/Base armed Mask-R-CNN obtain 45.4/47.4/49.0 box AP and 41.4/42.9/44.2 mask AP on COCO detection, surpassing contemporary MPViT-T, Swin-T, and Swin-S by 0.6/1.4/0.5 box AP and 0.4/1.3/0.9 mask AP separately with less FLOPs; Our EATFormer-Small/Base achieve 47.3/49.3 mIoU on ADE20K by Upernet that exceeds Swin-T/S by 2.8/1.7. Code is available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/EATFormer."
2206.09885,KOLOMVERSE: Korea open large-scale image dataset for object detection in   the maritime universe,"Over the years, datasets have been developed for various object detection tasks. Object detection in the maritime domain is essential for the safety and navigation of ships. However, there is still a lack of publicly available large-scale datasets in the maritime domain. To overcome this challenge, we present KOLOMVERSE, an open large-scale image dataset for object detection in the maritime domain by KRISO (Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering). We collected 5,845 hours of video data captured from 21 territorial waters of South Korea. Through an elaborate data quality assessment process, we gathered around 2,151,470 4K resolution images from the video data. This dataset considers various environments: weather, time, illumination, occlusion, viewpoint, background, wind speed, and visibility. The KOLOMVERSE consists of five classes (ship, buoy, fishnet buoy, lighthouse and wind farm) for maritime object detection. The dataset has images of 3840$\times$2160 pixels and to our knowledge, it is by far the largest publicly available dataset for object detection in the maritime domain. We performed object detection experiments and evaluated our dataset on several pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures to show the effectiveness and usefulness of our dataset. The dataset is available at: \url{https://github.com/MaritimeDataset/KOLOMVERSE}."
2206.10177,TCJA-SNN: Temporal-Channel Joint Attention for Spiking Neural Networks,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting widespread interest due to their biological plausibility, energy efficiency, and powerful spatio-temporal information representation ability. Given the critical role of attention mechanisms in enhancing neural network performance, the integration of SNNs and attention mechanisms exhibits potential to deliver energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. We present a novel Temporal-Channel Joint Attention mechanism for SNNs, referred to as TCJA-SNN. The proposed TCJA-SNN framework can effectively assess the significance of spike sequence from both spatial and temporal dimensions. More specifically, our essential technical contribution lies on: 1) We employ the squeeze operation to compress the spike stream into an average matrix. Then, we leverage two local attention mechanisms based on efficient 1D convolutions to facilitate comprehensive feature extraction at the temporal and channel levels independently. 2) We introduce the Cross Convolutional Fusion (CCF) layer as a novel approach to model the inter-dependencies between the temporal and channel scopes. This layer breaks the independence of these two dimensions and enables the interaction between features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TCJA-SNN outperforms SOTA by up to 15.7% accuracy on standard static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech 101, and DVS128 Gesture. Furthermore, we apply the TCJA-SNN framework to image generation tasks by leveraging a variation autoencoder. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first instance where the SNN-attention mechanism has been employed for image classification and generation tasks. Notably, our approach has achieved SOTA performance in both domains, establishing a significant advancement in the field. Codes are available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/TCJA."
2206.10274,Attention-driven Next-best-view Planning for Efficient Reconstruction of   Plants and Targeted Plant Parts,"Robots in tomato greenhouses need to perceive the plant and plant parts accurately to automate monitoring, harvesting, and de-leafing tasks. Existing perception systems struggle with the high levels of occlusion in plants and often result in poor perception accuracy. One reason for this is because they use fixed cameras or predefined camera movements. Next-best-view (NBV) planning presents an alternate approach, in which the camera viewpoints are reasoned and strategically planned such that the perception accuracy is improved. However, existing NBV-planning algorithms are agnostic to the task-at-hand and give equal importance to all the plant parts. This strategy is inefficient for greenhouse tasks that require targeted perception of specific plant parts, such as the perception of leaf nodes for de-leafing. To improve targeted perception in complex greenhouse environments, NBV planning algorithms need an attention mechanism to focus on the task-relevant plant parts. In this paper, the role of attention in improving targeted perception using an attention-driven NBV planning strategy was investigated. Through simulation experiments using plants with high levels of occlusion and structural complexity, it was shown that focusing attention on task-relevant plant parts can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of 3D reconstruction. Further, with real-world experiments, it was shown that these benefits extend to complex greenhouse conditions with natural variation and occlusion, natural illumination, sensor noise, and uncertainty in camera poses. The results clearly indicate that using attention-driven NBV planning in greenhouses can significantly improve the efficiency of perception and enhance the performance of robotic systems in greenhouse crop production."
2206.10779,Not Just Streaks: Towards Ground Truth for Single Image Deraining,"We propose a large-scale dataset of real-world rainy and clean image pairs and a method to remove degradations, induced by rain streaks and rain accumulation, from the image. As there exists no real-world dataset for deraining, current state-of-the-art methods rely on synthetic data and thus are limited by the sim2real domain gap; moreover, rigorous evaluation remains a challenge due to the absence of a real paired dataset. We fill this gap by collecting a real paired deraining dataset through meticulous control of non-rain variations. Our dataset enables paired training and quantitative evaluation for diverse real-world rain phenomena (e.g. rain streaks and rain accumulation). To learn a representation robust to rain phenomena, we propose a deep neural network that reconstructs the underlying scene by minimizing a rain-robust loss between rainy and clean images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art deraining methods on real rainy images under various conditions.

2206.10965,Polar Parametrization for Vision-based Surround-View 3D Detection,"3D detection based on surround-view camera system is a critical technique in autopilot. In this work, we present Polar Parametrization for 3D detection, which reformulates position parametrization, velocity decomposition, perception range, label assignment and loss function in polar coordinate system. Polar Parametrization establishes explicit associations between image patterns and prediction targets, exploiting the view symmetry of surround-view cameras as inductive bias to ease optimization and boost performance. Based on Polar Parametrization, we propose a surround-view 3D DEtection TRansformer, named PolarDETR. PolarDETR achieves promising performance-speed trade-off on different backbone configurations. Besides, PolarDETR ranks 1st on the leaderboard of nuScenes benchmark in terms of both 3D detection and 3D tracking at the submission time (Mar. 4th, 2022). Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/PolarDETR}."
2206.11011,Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization by Progressive   Complementary Learning,"Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to localize and classify action instances in long untrimmed videos with only video-level category labels. Due to the lack of snippet-level supervision for indicating action boundaries, previous methods typically assign pseudo labels for unlabeled snippets. However, since some action instances of different categories are visually similar, it is non-trivial to exactly label the (usually) one action category for a snippet, and incorrect pseudo labels would impair the localization performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel method from a category exclusion perspective, named Progressive Complementary Learning (ProCL), which gradually enhances the snippet-level supervision. Our method is inspired by the fact that video-level labels precisely indicate the categories that all snippets surely do not belong to, which is ignored by previous works. Accordingly, we first exclude these surely non-existent categories by a complementary learning loss. And then, we introduce the background-aware pseudo complementary labeling in order to exclude more categories for snippets of less ambiguity. Furthermore, for the remaining ambiguous snippets, we attempt to reduce the ambiguity by distinguishing foreground actions from the background. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks, namely THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3."
2206.11250,Leveraging RGB-D Data with Cross-Modal Context Mining for Glass Surface   Detection,"Glass surfaces are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as modern buildings tend to use a lot of glass panels. This, however, poses substantial challenges to the operations of autonomous systems such as robots, self-driving cars, and drones, as these glass panels can become transparent obstacles to navigation. Existing works attempt to exploit various cues, including glass boundary context or reflections, as priors. However, they are all based on input RGB images. We observe that the transmission of 3D depth sensor light through glass surfaces often produces blank regions in the depth maps, which can offer additional insights to complement the RGB image features for glass surface detection. In this work, we first propose a large-scale RGB-D glass surface detection dataset, \textit{RGB-D GSD}, for rigorous experiments and future research. It contains 3,009 images, paired with precise annotations, offering a wide range of real-world RGB-D glass surface categories. We then propose a novel glass surface detection framework combining RGB and depth information, with two novel modules: a cross-modal context mining (CCM) module to adaptively learn individual and mutual context features from RGB and depth information, and a depth-missing aware attention (DAA) module to explicitly exploit spatial locations where missing depths occur to help detect the presence of glass surfaces. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2206.11723,Self-Supervised Training with Autoencoders for Visual Anomaly Detection,"We focus on a specific use case in anomaly detection where the distribution of normal samples is supported by a lower-dimensional manifold. Here, regularized autoencoders provide a popular approach by learning the identity mapping on the set of normal examples, while trying to prevent good reconstruction on points outside of the manifold. Typically, this goal is implemented by controlling the capacity of the model, either directly by reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or implicitly by imposing some sparsity (or contraction) constraints on parts of the corresponding network. However, neither of these techniques does explicitly penalize the reconstruction of anomalous signals often resulting in poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a self-supervised learning regime that exploits discriminative information during training but focuses on the submanifold of normal examples. Informally, our training objective regularizes the model to produce locally consistent reconstructions, while replacing irregularities by acting as a filter that removes anomalous patterns. To support this intuition, we perform a rigorous formal analysis of the proposed method and provide a number of interesting insights. In particular, we show that the resulting model resembles a non-linear orthogonal projection of partially corrupted images onto the submanifold of uncorrupted samples. On the other hand, we identify the orthogonal projection as an optimal solution for a number of regularized autoencoders including the contractive and denoising variants. We support our theoretical analysis by empirical evaluation of the resulting detection and localization performance of the proposed method. In particular, we achieve a new state-of-the-art result on the MVTec AD dataset -- a challenging benchmark for visual anomaly detection in the manufacturing domain."
2206.11892,DDPM-CD: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models as Feature Extractors   for Change Detection,"Remote sensing change detection is crucial for understanding the dynamics of our planet's surface, facilitating the monitoring of environmental changes, evaluating human impact, predicting future trends, and supporting decision-making. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for change detection that can leverage off-the-shelf, unlabeled remote sensing images in the training process by pre-training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) - a class of generative models used in image synthesis. DDPMs learn the training data distribution by gradually converting training images into a Gaussian distribution using a Markov chain. During inference (i.e., sampling), they can generate a diverse set of samples closer to the training distribution, starting from Gaussian noise, achieving state-of-the-art image synthesis results. However, in this work, our focus is not on image synthesis but on utilizing it as a pre-trained feature extractor for the downstream application of change detection. Specifically, we fine-tune a lightweight change classifier utilizing the feature representations produced by the pre-trained DDPM alongside change labels. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, DSIFN-CD, and CDD datasets demonstrate that the proposed DDPM-CD method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art change detection methods in terms of F1 score, IoU, and overall accuracy, highlighting the pivotal role of pre-trained DDPM as a feature extractor for downstream applications. We have made both the code and pre-trained models available at https://github.com/wgcban/ddpm-cd"
2206.12099,"A novel approach for glaucoma classification by wavelet neural networks   using graph-based, statisitcal features of qualitatively improved images","In this paper, we have proposed a new glaucoma classification approach that employs a wavelet neural network (WNN) on optimally enhanced retinal images features. To avoid tedious and error prone manual analysis of retinal images by ophthalmologists, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) substantially aids in robust diagnosis. Our objective is to introduce a CAD system with a fresh approach. Retinal image quality improvement is attempted in two phases. The retinal image preprocessing phase improves the brightness and contrast of the image through quantile based histogram modification. It is followed by the image enhancement phase, which involves multi scale morphological operations using image specific dynamic structuring elements for the retinal structure enrichment. Graph based retinal image features in terms of Local Graph Structures (LGS) and Graph Shortest Path (GSP) statistics are extracted from various directions along with the statistical features from the enhanced retinal dataset. WNN is employed to classify glaucoma retinal images with a suitable wavelet activation function. The performance of the WNN classifier is compared with multilayer perceptron neural networks with various datasets. The results show our approach is superior to the existing approaches."
2206.12809,Role and Integration of Image Processing Systems in Maritime Target   Tracking,"In recent years, maritime traffic has increased, especially in seaborne trade. To ensure safety, security, and environmental protection, various systems have been deployed, often combining data for improved effectiveness. One key application of this combined data is tracking targets at sea, where the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and X-band marine radar are crucial. Recently, there has been growing interest in using visual data from cameras to enhance tracking. This has led to the development of several tracking algorithms based on image processing. While much of the existing literature addresses data fusion, there hasn't been much focus on why integrating image processing systems is important given the existence of the other systems. In our paper, we aim to analyze these surveillance systems and highlight the reasons for integrating image processing systems. Our main goal is to show how this integration can improve maritime security, offering practical insights into enhancing safety and protection at sea."
2206.12943,Multi-view Feature Augmentation with Adaptive Class Activation Mapping,"We propose an end-to-end-trainable feature augmentation module built for image classification that extracts and exploits multi-view local features to boost model performance. Different from using global average pooling (GAP) to extract vectorized features from only the global view, we propose to sample and ensemble diverse multi-view local features to improve model robustness. To sample class-representative local features, we incorporate a simple auxiliary classifier head (comprising only one 1$\times$1 convolutional layer) which efficiently and adaptively attends to class-discriminative local regions of feature maps via our proposed AdaCAM (Adaptive Class Activation Mapping). Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent and noticeable performance gains achieved by our multi-view feature augmentation module."
2206.13082,PST: Plant segmentation transformer for 3D point clouds of rapeseed   plants at the podding stage,"Segmentation of plant point clouds to obtain high-precise morphological traits is essential for plant phenotyping. Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, previous studies mainly focus on the hard voxelization-based or down-sampling-based methods, which are limited to segmenting simple plant organs. Segmentation of complex plant point clouds with a high spatial resolution still remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a deep learning network plant segmentation transformer (PST) to achieve the semantic and instance segmentation of rapeseed plants point clouds acquired by handheld laser scanning (HLS) with the high spatial resolution, which can characterize the tiny siliques as the main traits targeted. PST is composed of: (i) a dynamic voxel feature encoder (DVFE) to aggregate the point features with the raw spatial resolution; (ii) the dual window sets attention blocks to capture the contextual information; and (iii) a dense feature propagation module to obtain the final dense point feature map. The results proved that PST and PST-PointGroup (PG) achieved superior performance in semantic and instance segmentation tasks. For the semantic segmentation, the mean IoU, mean Precision, mean Recall, mean F1-score, and overall accuracy of PST were 93.96%, 97.29%, 96.52%, 96.88%, and 97.07%, achieving an improvement of 7.62%, 3.28%, 4.8%, 4.25%, and 3.88% compared to the second-best state-of-the-art network PAConv. For instance segmentation, PST-PG reached 89.51%, 89.85%, 88.83% and 82.53% in mCov, mWCov, mPerc90, and mRec90, achieving an improvement of 2.93%, 2.21%, 1.99%, and 5.9% compared to the original PG. This study proves that the deep-learning-based point cloud segmentation method has a great potential for resolving dense plant point clouds with complex morphological traits."
2206.13199,MGNet: Monocular Geometric Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving,"We introduce MGNet, a multi-task framework for monocular geometric scene understanding. We define monocular geometric scene understanding as the combination of two known tasks: Panoptic segmentation and self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Panoptic segmentation captures the full scene not only semantically, but also on an instance basis. Self-supervised monocular depth estimation uses geometric constraints derived from the camera measurement model in order to measure depth from monocular video sequences only. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose the combination of these two tasks in one single model. Our model is designed with focus on low latency to provide fast inference in real-time on a single consumer-grade GPU. During deployment, our model produces dense 3D point clouds with instance aware semantic labels from single high-resolution camera images. We evaluate our model on two popular autonomous driving benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes and KITTI, and show competitive performance among other real-time capable methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/markusschoen/MGNet."
2206.15179,D2-LRR: A Dual-Decomposed MDLatLRR Approach for Medical Image Fusion,"In image fusion tasks, an ideal image decomposition method can bring better performance. MDLatLRR has done a great job in this aspect, but there is still exist some space for improvement. Considering that MDLatLRR focuses solely on the detailed parts (salient features) extracted from input images via latent low-rank representation (LatLRR), the basic parts (principal features) extracted by LatLRR are not fully utilized. Therefore, we introduced an enhanced multi-level decomposition method named dual-decomposed MDLatLRR (D2-LRR) which effectively analyzes and utilizes all image features extracted through LatLRR. Specifically, color images are converted into YUV color space and grayscale images, and the Y-channel and grayscale images are input into the trained parameters of LatLRR to obtain the detailed parts containing four rounds of decomposition and the basic parts. Subsequently, the basic parts are fused using an average strategy, while the detail part is fused using kernel norm operation. The fused image is ultimately transformed back into an RGB image, resulting in the final fusion output. We apply D2-LRR to medical image fusion tasks. The detailed parts are fused employing a nuclear-norm operation, while the basic parts are fused using an average strategy. Comparative analyses among existing methods showcase that our proposed approach attains cutting-edge fusion performance in both objective and subjective assessments."
2206.15462,Improving Visual Grounding by Encouraging Consistent Gradient-based   Explanations,"We propose a margin-based loss for tuning joint vision-language models so that their gradient-based explanations are consistent with region-level annotations provided by humans for relatively smaller grounding datasets. We refer to this objective as Attention Mask Consistency (AMC) and demonstrate that it produces superior visual grounding results than previous methods that rely on using vision-language models to score the outputs of object detectors. Particularly, a model trained with AMC on top of standard vision-language modeling objectives obtains a state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.49% in the Flickr30k visual grounding benchmark, an absolute improvement of 5.38% when compared to the best previous model trained under the same level of supervision. Our approach also performs exceedingly well on established benchmarks for referring expression comprehension where it obtains 80.34% accuracy in the easy test of RefCOCO+, and 64.55% in the difficult split. AMC is effective, easy to implement, and is general as it can be adopted by any vision-language model, and can use any type of region annotations."
2206.15472,On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory,"On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning. A video demo can be found here: https://youtu.be/0pUFZYdoMY8."
2207.00050,Semantic Image Synthesis via Diffusion Models,"Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in various image generation tasks compared with Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators. To further improve the generation quality and semantic interpretability in semantic image synthesis, we introduce the classifier-free guidance sampling strategy, which acknowledge the scores of an unconditional model for sampling process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity (FID) and diversity (LPIPS). Our code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/WeilunWang/semantic-diffusion-model."
2207.00067,Rethinking Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) adapts a model trained on one domain (called source) to a novel domain (called target) using only unlabeled data. Due to its high annotation cost, researchers have developed many UDA methods for semantic segmentation, which assume no labeled sample is available in the target domain. We question the practicality of this assumption for two reasons. First, after training a model with a UDA method, we must somehow verify the model before deployment. Second, UDA methods have at least a few hyper-parameters that need to be determined. The surest solution to these is to evaluate the model using validation data, i.e., a certain amount of labeled target-domain samples. This question about the basic assumption of UDA leads us to rethink UDA from a data-centric point of view. Specifically, we assume we have access to a minimum level of labeled data. Then, we ask how much is necessary to find good hyper-parameters of existing UDA methods. We then consider what if we use the same data for supervised training of the same model, e.g., finetuning. We conducted experiments to answer these questions with popular scenarios, {GTA5, SYNTHIA}$\rightarrow$Cityscapes. We found that i) choosing good hyper-parameters needs only a few labeled images for some UDA methods whereas a lot more for others; and ii) simple finetuning works surprisingly well; it outperforms many UDA methods if only several dozens of labeled images are available."
2207.01136,Beyond Visual Field of View: Perceiving 3D Environment with Echoes and   Vision,"This paper focuses on perceiving and navigating 3D environments using echoes and RGB image. In particular, we perform depth estimation by fusing RGB image with echoes, received from multiple orientations. Unlike previous works, we go beyond the field of view of the RGB and estimate dense depth maps for substantially larger parts of the environment. We show that the echoes provide holistic and in-expensive information about the 3D structures complementing the RGB image. Moreover, we study how echoes and the wide field-of-view depth maps can be utilised in robot navigation. We compare the proposed methods against recent baselines using two sets of challenging realistic 3D environments: Replica and Matterport3D. The implementation and pre-trained models will be made publicly available."
2207.01200,S$^{5}$Mars: Semi-Supervised Learning for Mars Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning has become a powerful tool for Mars exploration. Mars terrain semantic segmentation is an important Martian vision task, which is the base of rover autonomous planning and safe driving. However, there is a lack of sufficient detailed and high-confidence data annotations, which are exactly required by most deep learning methods to obtain a good model. To address this problem, we propose our solution from the perspective of joint data and method design. We first present a newdataset S5Mars for Semi-SuperviSed learning on Mars Semantic Segmentation, which contains 6K high-resolution images and is sparsely annotated based on confidence, ensuring the high quality of labels. Then to learn from this sparse data, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework for Mars image semantic segmentation, to learn representations from limited labeled data. Different from the existing SSL methods which are mostly targeted at the Earth image data, our method takes into account Mars data characteristics. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of current widely used natural image augmentations on Mars images. Based on the analysis, we then proposed two novel and effective augmentations for SSL of Mars segmentation, AugIN and SAM-Mix, which serve as strong augmentations to boost the model performance. Meanwhile, to fully leverage the unlabeled data, we introduce a soft-to-hard consistency learning strategy, learning from different targets based on prediction confidence. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art SSL approaches remarkably. Our proposed dataset is available at https://jhang2020.github.io/S5Mars.github.io/."
2207.01390,FakeNews: GAN-based generation of realistic 3D volumetric data -- A   systematic review and taxonomy,"With the massive proliferation of data-driven algorithms, such as deep learning-based approaches, the availability of high-quality data is of great interest. Volumetric data is very important in medicine, as it ranges from disease diagnoses to therapy monitoring. When the dataset is sufficient, models can be trained to help doctors with these tasks. Unfortunately, there are scenarios where large amounts of data is unavailable. For example, rare diseases and privacy issues can lead to restricted data availability. In non-medical fields, the high cost of obtaining enough high-quality data can also be a concern. A solution to these problems can be the generation of realistic synthetic data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The existence of these mechanisms is a good asset, especially in healthcare, as the data must be of good quality, realistic, and without privacy issues. Therefore, most of the publications on volumetric GANs are within the medical domain. In this review, we provide a summary of works that generate realistic volumetric synthetic data using GANs. We therefore outline GAN-based methods in these areas with common architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics, including their advantages and disadvantages. We present a novel taxonomy, evaluations, challenges, and research opportunities to provide a holistic overview of the current state of volumetric GANs."
2207.02173,DBN-Mix: Training Dual Branch Network Using Bilateral Mixup Augmentation   for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition,"There is growing interest in the challenging visual perception task of learning from long-tailed class distributions. The extreme class imbalance in the training dataset biases the model to prefer recognizing majority class data over minority class data. Furthermore, the lack of diversity in minority class samples makes it difficult to find a good representation. In this paper, we propose an effective data augmentation method, referred to as bilateral mixup augmentation, which can improve the performance of long-tailed visual recognition. The bilateral mixup augmentation combines two samples generated by a uniform sampler and a re-balanced sampler and augments the training dataset to enhance the representation learning for minority classes. We also reduce the classifier bias using class-wise temperature scaling, which scales the logits differently per class in the training phase. We apply both ideas to the dual-branch network (DBN) framework, presenting a new model, named dual-branch network with bilateral mixup (DBN-Mix). Experiments on popular long-tailed visual recognition datasets show that DBN-Mix improves performance significantly over baseline and that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in some categories of benchmarks."
2207.02410,A Deep Model for Partial Multi-Label Image Classification with   Curriculum Based Disambiguation,"In this paper, we study the partial multi-label (PML) image classification problem, where each image is annotated with a candidate label set consists of multiple relevant labels and other noisy labels. Existing PML methods typically design a disambiguation strategy to filter out noisy labels by utilizing prior knowledge with extra assumptions, which unfortunately is unavailable in many real tasks. Furthermore, because the objective function for disambiguation is usually elaborately designed on the whole training set, it can be hardly optimized in a deep model with SGD on mini-batches. In this paper, for the first time we propose a deep model for PML to enhance the representation and discrimination ability. On one hand, we propose a novel curriculum based disambiguation strategy to progressively identify ground-truth labels by incorporating the varied difficulties of different classes. On the other hand, a consistency regularization is introduced for model retraining to balance fitting identified easy labels and exploiting potential relevant labels. Extensive experimental results on the commonly used benchmark datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods."
2207.02466,GLENet: Boosting 3D Object Detectors with Generative Label Uncertainty   Estimation,"The inherent ambiguity in ground-truth annotations of 3D bounding boxes, caused by occlusions, signal missing, or manual annotation errors, can confuse deep 3D object detectors during training, thus deteriorating detection accuracy. However, existing methods overlook such issues to some extent and treat the labels as deterministic. In this paper, we formulate the label uncertainty problem as the diversity of potentially plausible bounding boxes of objects. Then, we propose GLENet, a generative framework adapted from conditional variational autoencoders, to model the one-to-many relationship between a typical 3D object and its potential ground-truth bounding boxes with latent variables. The label uncertainty generated by GLENet is a plug-and-play module and can be conveniently integrated into existing deep 3D detectors to build probabilistic detectors and supervise the learning of the localization uncertainty. Besides, we propose an uncertainty-aware quality estimator architecture in probabilistic detectors to guide the training of the IoU-branch with predicted localization uncertainty. We incorporate the proposed methods into various popular base 3D detectors and demonstrate significant and consistent performance gains on both KITTI and Waymo benchmark datasets. Especially, the proposed GLENet-VR outperforms all published LiDAR-based approaches by a large margin and achieves the top rank among single-modal methods on the challenging KITTI test set. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Eaphan/GLENet}."
2207.03341,Softmax-free Linear Transformers,"Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for visual perception tasks. The self-attention mechanism underpinning the strength of ViTs has a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. This motivates the development of approximating the self-attention at linear complexity. However, an in-depth analysis in this work reveals that existing methods are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We identify that their limitations are rooted in the inheritance of softmax-based self-attention during approximations, that is, normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors using the softmax function. As preserving the softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. By this insight, a family of Softmax-Free Transformers (SOFT) are proposed. Specifically, a Gaussian kernel function is adopted to replace the dot-product similarity, enabling a full self-attention matrix to be approximated under low-rank matrix decomposition. For computational robustness, we estimate the Moore-Penrose inverse using an iterative Newton-Raphson method in the forward process only, while calculating its theoretical gradients only once in the backward process. To further expand applicability (e.g., dense prediction tasks), an efficient symmetric normalization technique is introduced. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. With linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted by SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Code and models are available at https://github.com/fudan-zvg/SOFT."
2207.03677,SuperTickets: Drawing Task-Agnostic Lottery Tickets from Supernets via   Jointly Architecture Searching and Parameter Pruning,"Neural architecture search (NAS) has demonstrated amazing success in searching for efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) from a given supernet. In parallel, the lottery ticket hypothesis has shown that DNNs contain small subnetworks that can be trained from scratch to achieve a comparable or higher accuracy than original DNNs. As such, it is currently a common practice to develop efficient DNNs via a pipeline of first search and then prune. Nevertheless, doing so often requires a search-train-prune-retrain process and thus prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we discover for the first time that both efficient DNNs and their lottery subnetworks (i.e., lottery tickets) can be directly identified from a supernet, which we term as SuperTickets, via a two-in-one training scheme with jointly architecture searching and parameter pruning. Moreover, we develop a progressive and unified SuperTickets identification strategy that allows the connectivity of subnetworks to change during supernet training, achieving better accuracy and efficiency trade-offs than conventional sparse training. Finally, we evaluate whether such identified SuperTickets drawn from one task can transfer well to other tasks, validating their potential of handling multiple tasks simultaneously. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three tasks and four benchmark datasets validate that our proposed SuperTickets achieve boosted accuracy and efficiency trade-offs than both typical NAS and pruning pipelines, regardless of having retraining or not. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/RICE-EIC/SuperTickets."
2207.04007,Event Collapse in Contrast Maximization Frameworks,"Contrast maximization (CMax) is a framework that provides state-of-the-art results on several event-based computer vision tasks, such as ego-motion or optical flow estimation. However, it may suffer from a problem called event collapse, which is an undesired solution where events are warped into too few pixels. As prior works have largely ignored the issue or proposed workarounds, it is imperative to analyze this phenomenon in detail. Our work demonstrates event collapse in its simplest form and proposes collapse metrics by using first principles of space-time deformation based on differential geometry and physics. We experimentally show on publicly available datasets that the proposed metrics mitigate event collapse and do not harm well-posed warps. To the best of our knowledge, regularizers based on the proposed metrics are the only effective solution against event collapse in the experimental settings considered, compared with other methods. We hope that this work inspires further research to tackle more complex warp models."
2207.04250,Improving saliency models' predictions of the next fixation with humans'   intrinsic cost of gaze shifts,"The human prioritization of image regions can be modeled in a time invariant fashion with saliency maps or sequentially with scanpath models. However, while both types of models have steadily improved on several benchmarks and datasets, there is still a considerable gap in predicting human gaze. Here, we leverage two recent developments to reduce this gap: theoretical analyses establishing a principled framework for predicting the next gaze target and the empirical measurement of the human cost for gaze switches independently of image content. We introduce an algorithm in the framework of sequential decision making, which converts any static saliency map into a sequence of dynamic history-dependent value maps, which are recomputed after each gaze shift. These maps are based on 1) a saliency map provided by an arbitrary saliency model, 2) the recently measured human cost function quantifying preferences in magnitude and direction of eye movements, and 3) a sequential exploration bonus, which changes with each subsequent gaze shift. The parameters of the spatial extent and temporal decay of this exploration bonus are estimated from human gaze data. The relative contributions of these three components were optimized on the MIT1003 dataset for the NSS score and are sufficient to significantly outperform predictions of the next gaze target on NSS and AUC scores for five state of the art saliency models on three image data sets. Thus, we provide an implementation of human gaze preferences, which can be used to improve arbitrary saliency models' predictions of humans' next gaze targets."
2207.04434,Hiding Your Signals: A Security Analysis of PPG-based Biometric   Authentication,"Recently, physiological signal-based biometric systems have received wide attention. Unlike traditional biometric features, physiological signals can not be easily compromised (usually unobservable to human eyes). Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal is easy to measure, making it more attractive than many other physiological signals for biometric authentication. However, with the advent of remote PPG (rPPG), unobservability has been challenged when the attacker can remotely steal the rPPG signals by monitoring the victim's face, subsequently posing a threat to PPG-based biometrics. In PPG-based biometric authentication, current attack approaches mandate the victim's PPG signal, making rPPG-based attacks neglected. In this paper, we firstly analyze the security of PPG-based biometrics, including user authentication and communication protocols. We evaluate the signal waveforms, heart rate and inter-pulse-interval information extracted by five rPPG methods, including four traditional optical computing methods (CHROM, POS, LGI, PCA) and one deep learning method (CL_rPPG). We conducted experiments on five datasets (PURE, UBFC_rPPG, UBFC_Phys, LGI_PPGI, and COHFACE) to collect a comprehensive set of results. Our empirical studies show that rPPG poses a serious threat to the authentication system. The success rate of the rPPG signal spoofing attack in the user authentication system reached 0.35. The bit hit rate is 0.6 in inter-pulse-interval-based security protocols. Further, we propose an active defence strategy to hide the physiological signals of the face to resist the attack. It reduces the success rate of rPPG spoofing attacks in user authentication to 0.05. The bit hit rate was reduced to 0.5, which is at the level of a random guess. Our strategy effectively prevents the exposure of PPG signals to protect users' sensitive physiological data."
2207.04438,SRRT: Exploring Search Region Regulation for Visual Object Tracking,"The dominant trackers generate a fixed-size rectangular region based on the previous prediction or initial bounding box as the model input, i.e., search region. While this manner obtains promising tracking efficiency, a fixed-size search region lacks flexibility and is likely to fail in some cases, e.g., fast motion and distractor interference. Trackers tend to lose the target object due to the limited search region or experience interference from distractors due to the excessive search region. Drawing inspiration from the pattern humans track an object, we propose a novel tracking paradigm, called Search Region Regulation Tracking (SRRT) that applies a small eyereach when the target is captured and zooms out the search field when the target is about to be lost. SRRT applies a proposed search region regulator to estimate an optimal search region dynamically for each frame, by which the tracker can flexibly respond to transient changes in the location of object occurrences. To adapt the object's appearance variation during online tracking, we further propose a lockingstate determined updating strategy for reference frame updating. The proposed SRRT is concise without bells and whistles, yet achieves evident improvements and competitive results with other state-of-the-art trackers on eight benchmarks. On the large-scale LaSOT benchmark, SRRT improves SiamRPN++ and TransT with absolute gains of 4.6% and 3.1% in terms of AUC. The code and models will be released."
2207.04913,Generalizing to Unseen Domains with Wasserstein Distributional   Robustness under Limited Source Knowledge,"Domain generalization aims at learning a universal model that performs well on unseen target domains, incorporating knowledge from multiple source domains. In this research, we consider the scenario where different domain shifts occur among conditional distributions of different classes across domains. When labeled samples in the source domains are limited, existing approaches are not sufficiently robust. To address this problem, we propose a novel domain generalization framework called {Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Domain Generalization} (WDRDG), inspired by the concept of distributionally robust optimization. We encourage robustness over conditional distributions within class-specific Wasserstein uncertainty sets and optimize the worst-case performance of a classifier over these uncertainty sets. We further develop a test-time adaptation module leveraging optimal transport to quantify the relationship between the unseen target domain and source domains to make adaptive inference for target data. Experiments on the Rotated MNIST, PACS and the VLCS datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively balance the robustness and discriminability in challenging generalization scenarios."
2207.04934,Multilevel Geometric Optimization for Regularised Constrained Linear   Inverse Problems,"We present a geometric multilevel optimization approach that smoothly incorporates box constraints. Given a box constrained optimization problem, we consider a hierarchy of models with varying discretization levels. Finer models are accurate but expensive to compute, while coarser models are less accurate but cheaper to compute. When working at the fine level, multilevel optimisation computes the search direction based on a coarser model which speeds up updates at the fine level. Moreover, exploiting geometry induced by the hierarchy the feasibility of the updates is preserved. In particular, our approach extends classical components of multigrid methods like restriction and prolongation to the Riemannian structure of our constraints."
2207.05053,Learning Continuous Grasping Function with a Dexterous Hand from Human   Demonstrations,"We propose to learn to generate grasping motion for manipulation with a dexterous hand using implicit functions. With continuous time inputs, the model can generate a continuous and smooth grasping plan. We name the proposed model Continuous Grasping Function (CGF). CGF is learned via generative modeling with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder using 3D human demonstrations. We will first convert the large-scale human-object interaction trajectories to robot demonstrations via motion retargeting, and then use these demonstrations to train CGF. During inference, we perform sampling with CGF to generate different grasping plans in the simulator and select the successful ones to transfer to the real robot. By training on diverse human data, our CGF allows generalization to manipulate multiple objects. Compared to previous planning algorithms, CGF is more efficient and achieves significant improvement on success rate when transferred to grasping with the real Allegro Hand. Our project page is available at https://jianglongye.com/cgf ."
2207.05195,Collaborative Uncertainty Benefits Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory   Forecasting,"In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents."
2207.05317,CPO: Change Robust Panorama to Point Cloud Localization,"We present CPO, a fast and robust algorithm that localizes a 2D panorama with respect to a 3D point cloud of a scene possibly containing changes. To robustly handle scene changes, our approach deviates from conventional feature point matching, and focuses on the spatial context provided from panorama images. Specifically, we propose efficient color histogram generation and subsequent robust localization using score maps. By utilizing the unique equivariance of spherical projections, we propose very fast color histogram generation for a large number of camera poses without explicitly rendering images for all candidate poses. We accumulate the regional consistency of the panorama and point cloud as 2D/3D score maps, and use them to weigh the input color values to further increase robustness. The weighted color distribution quickly finds good initial poses and achieves stable convergence for gradient-based optimization. CPO is lightweight and achieves effective localization in all tested scenarios, showing stable performance despite scene changes, repetitive structures, or featureless regions, which are typical challenges for visual localization with perspective cameras. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/82magnolia/panoramic-localization/}."
2207.05510,Transferability-Guided Cross-Domain Cross-Task Transfer Learning,"We propose two novel transferability metrics F-OTCE (Fast Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy) and JC-OTCE (Joint Correspondence OTCE) to evaluate how much the source model (task) can benefit the learning of the target task and to learn more transferable representations for cross-domain cross-task transfer learning. Unlike the existing metric that requires evaluating the empirical transferability on auxiliary tasks, our metrics are auxiliary-free such that they can be computed much more efficiently. Specifically, F-OTCE estimates transferability by first solving an Optimal Transport (OT) problem between source and target distributions, and then uses the optimal coupling to compute the Negative Conditional Entropy between source and target labels. It can also serve as a loss function to maximize the transferability of the source model before finetuning on the target task. Meanwhile, JC-OTCE improves the transferability robustness of F-OTCE by including label distances in the OT problem, though it may incur additional computation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-OTCE and JC-OTCE outperform state-of-the-art auxiliary-free metrics by 18.85% and 28.88%, respectively in correlation coefficient with the ground-truth transfer accuracy. By eliminating the training cost of auxiliary tasks, the two metrics reduces the total computation time of the previous method from 43 minutes to 9.32s and 10.78s, respectively, for a pair of tasks. When used as a loss function, F-OTCE shows consistent improvements on the transfer accuracy of the source model in few-shot classification experiments, with up to 4.41% accuracy gain."
2207.06104,Automated Detection of Label Errors in Semantic Segmentation Datasets   via Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification,"In this work, we for the first time present a method for detecting label errors in image datasets with semantic segmentation, i.e., pixel-wise class labels. Annotation acquisition for semantic segmentation datasets is time-consuming and requires plenty of human labor. In particular, review processes are time consuming and label errors can easily be overlooked by humans. The consequences are biased benchmarks and in extreme cases also performance degradation of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on such datasets. DNNs for semantic segmentation yield pixel-wise predictions, which makes detection of label errors via uncertainty quantification a complex task. Uncertainty is particularly pronounced at the transitions between connected components of the prediction. By lifting the consideration of uncertainty to the level of predicted components, we enable the usage of DNNs together with component-level uncertainty quantification for the detection of label errors. We present a principled approach to benchmarking the task of label error detection by dropping labels from the Cityscapes dataset as well from a dataset extracted from the CARLA driving simulator, where in the latter case we have the labels under control. Our experiments show that our approach is able to detect the vast majority of label errors while controlling the number of false label error detections. Furthermore, we apply our method to semantic segmentation datasets frequently used by the computer vision community and present a collection of label errors along with sample statistics."
2207.06418,Open High-Resolution Satellite Imagery: The WorldStrat Dataset -- With Application to Super-Resolution,"Analyzing the planet at scale with satellite imagery and machine learning is a dream that has been constantly hindered by the cost of difficult-to-access highly-representative high-resolution imagery. To remediate this, we introduce here the WorldStrat dataset. The largest and most varied such publicly available dataset, at Airbus SPOT 6/7 satellites' high resolution of up to 1.5 m/pixel, empowered by European Space Agency's Phi-Lab as part of the ESA-funded QueryPlanet project, we curate nearly 10,000 sqkm of unique locations to ensure stratified representation of all types of land-use across the world: from agriculture to ice caps, from forests to multiple urbanization densities. We also enrich those with locations typically under-represented in ML datasets: sites of humanitarian interest, illegal mining sites, and settlements of persons at risk. We temporally-match each high-resolution image with multiple low-resolution images from the freely accessible lower-resolution Sentinel-2 satellites at 10 m/pixel. We accompany this dataset with an open-source Python package to: rebuild or extend the WorldStrat dataset, train and infer baseline algorithms, and learn with abundant tutorials, all compatible with the popular EO-learn toolbox. We hereby hope to foster broad-spectrum applications of ML to satellite imagery, and possibly develop from free public low-resolution Sentinel2 imagery the same power of analysis allowed by costly private high-resolution imagery. We illustrate this specific point by training and releasing several highly compute-efficient baselines on the task of Multi-Frame Super-Resolution. High-resolution Airbus imagery is CC BY-NC, while the labels and Sentinel2 imagery are CC BY, and the source code and pre-trained models under BSD. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/6810791 and the software package at https://github.com/worldstrat/worldstrat ."
2207.06569,"Benign, Tempered, or Catastrophic: A Taxonomy of Overfitting","The practical success of overparameterized neural networks has motivated the recent scientific study of interpolating methods, which perfectly fit their training data. Certain interpolating methods, including neural networks, can fit noisy training data without catastrophically bad test performance, in defiance of standard intuitions from statistical learning theory. Aiming to explain this, a body of recent work has studied benign overfitting, a phenomenon where some interpolating methods approach Bayes optimality, even in the presence of noise. In this work we argue that while benign overfitting has been instructive and fruitful to study, many real interpolating methods like neural networks do not fit benignly: modest noise in the training set causes nonzero (but non-infinite) excess risk at test time, implying these models are neither benign nor catastrophic but rather fall in an intermediate regime. We call this intermediate regime tempered overfitting, and we initiate its systematic study. We first explore this phenomenon in the context of kernel (ridge) regression (KR) by obtaining conditions on the ridge parameter and kernel eigenspectrum under which KR exhibits each of the three behaviors. We find that kernels with powerlaw spectra, including Laplace kernels and ReLU neural tangent kernels, exhibit tempered overfitting. We then empirically study deep neural networks through the lens of our taxonomy, and find that those trained to interpolation are tempered, while those stopped early are benign. We hope our work leads to a more refined understanding of overfitting in modern learning."
2207.06817,Pseudo-Labeling Based Practical Semi-Supervised Meta-Training for Few-Shot Learning,"Most existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods require a large amount of labeled data in meta-training, which is a major limit. To reduce the requirement of labels, a semi-supervised meta-training (SSMT) setting has been proposed for FSL, which includes only a few labeled samples and numbers of unlabeled samples in base classes. However, existing methods under this setting require class-aware sample selection from the unlabeled set, which violates the assumption of unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a practical semi-supervised meta-training setting with truly unlabeled data to facilitate the applications of FSL in realistic scenarios. To better utilize both the labeled and truly unlabeled data, we propose a simple and effective meta-training framework, called pseudo-labeling based meta-learning (PLML). Firstly, we train a classifier via common semi-supervised learning (SSL) and use it to obtain the pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Then we build few-shot tasks from labeled and pseudo-labeled data and design a novel finetuning method with feature smoothing and noise suppression to better learn the FSL model from noise labels. Surprisingly, through extensive experiments across two FSL datasets, we find that this simple meta-training framework effectively prevents the performance degradation of various FSL models under limited labeled data, and also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SSMT models. Besides, benefiting from meta-training, our method also improves two representative SSL algorithms as well."
2207.06968,DASS: Differentiable Architecture Search for Sparse neural networks,"The deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices is hindered by the substantial gap between performance requirements and available processing power. While recent research has made significant strides in developing pruning methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs, there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures. We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of MobileNet-v2 from 73.44% to 81.35% (+7.91% improvement) with 3.87x faster inference time."
2207.07089,A Personalized Zero-Shot ECG Arrhythmia Monitoring System: From Sparse   Representation Based Domain Adaption to Energy Efficient Abnormal Beat   Detection for Practical ECG Surveillance,"This paper proposes a low-cost and highly accurate ECG-monitoring system intended for personalized early arrhythmia detection for wearable mobile sensors. Earlier supervised approaches for personalized ECG monitoring require both abnormal and normal heartbeats for the training of the dedicated classifier. However, in a real-world scenario where the personalized algorithm is embedded in a wearable device, such training data is not available for healthy people with no cardiac disorder history. In this study, (i) we propose a null space analysis on the healthy signal space obtained via sparse dictionary learning, and investigate how a simple null space projection or alternatively regularized least squares-based classification methods can reduce the computational complexity, without sacrificing the detection accuracy, when compared to sparse representation-based classification. (ii) Then we introduce a sparse representation-based domain adaptation technique in order to project other existing users' abnormal and normal signals onto the new user's signal space, enabling us to train the dedicated classifier without having any abnormal heartbeat of the new user. Therefore, zero-shot learning can be achieved without the need for synthetic abnormal heartbeat generation. An extensive set of experiments performed on the benchmark MIT-BIH ECG dataset shows that when this domain adaptation-based training data generator is used with a simple 1-D CNN classifier, the method outperforms the prior work by a significant margin. (iii) Then, by combining (i) and (ii), we propose an ensemble classifier that further improves the performance. This approach for zero-shot arrhythmia detection achieves an average accuracy level of 98.2% and an F1-Score of 92.8%. Finally, a personalized energy-efficient ECG monitoring scheme is proposed using the above-mentioned innovations."
2207.07609,DOLPHINS: Dataset for Collaborative Perception enabled Harmonious and   Interconnected Self-driving,"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network has enabled collaborative perception in autonomous driving, which is a promising solution to the fundamental defect of stand-alone intelligence including blind zones and long-range perception. However, the lack of datasets has severely blocked the development of collaborative perception algorithms. In this work, we release DOLPHINS: Dataset for cOllaborative Perception enabled Harmonious and INterconnected Self-driving, as a new simulated large-scale various-scenario multi-view multi-modality autonomous driving dataset, which provides a ground-breaking benchmark platform for interconnected autonomous driving. DOLPHINS outperforms current datasets in six dimensions: temporally-aligned images and point clouds from both vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) enabling both Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based collaborative perception; 6 typical scenarios with dynamic weather conditions make the most various interconnected autonomous driving dataset; meticulously selected viewpoints providing full coverage of the key areas and every object; 42376 frames and 292549 objects, as well as the corresponding 3D annotations, geo-positions, and calibrations, compose the largest dataset for collaborative perception; Full-HD images and 64-line LiDARs construct high-resolution data with sufficient details; well-organized APIs and open-source codes ensure the extensibility of DOLPHINS. We also construct a benchmark of 2D detection, 3D detection, and multi-view collaborative perception tasks on DOLPHINS. The experiment results show that the raw-level fusion scheme through V2X communication can help to improve the precision as well as to reduce the necessity of expensive LiDAR equipment on vehicles when RSUs exist, which may accelerate the popularity of interconnected self-driving vehicles. DOLPHINS is now available on https://dolphins-dataset.net/."
2207.07827,Mitigating Data Redundancy to Revitalize Transformer-based Long-Term   Time Series Forecasting System,"Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) is fundamental to various real-world applications, where Transformer-based models have become the dominant framework due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, these models often experience overfitting due to data redundancy in rolling forecasting settings, limiting their generalization ability particularly evident in longer sequences with highly similar adjacent data. In this work, we introduce CLMFormer, a novel framework that mitigates redundancy through curriculum learning and a memory-driven decoder. Specifically, we progressively introduce Bernoulli noise to the training samples, which effectively breaks the high similarity between adjacent data points. This curriculum-driven noise introduction aids the memory-driven decoder by supplying more diverse and representative training data, enhancing the decoder's ability to model seasonal tendencies and dependencies in the time-series data. To further enhance forecasting accuracy, we introduce a memory-driven decoder. This component enables the model to capture seasonal tendencies and dependencies in the time-series data and leverages temporal relationships to facilitate the forecasting process. Extensive experiments on six real-world LTSF benchmarks show that CLMFormer consistently improves Transformer-based models by up to 30%, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-horizon forecasting."
2207.07929,Towards Lightweight Super-Resolution with Dual Regression Learning,"Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution (SR) tasks by learning a mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, the SR problem is typically an ill-posed problem and existing methods would come with several limitations. First, the possible mapping space of SR can be extremely large since there may exist many different HR images that can be super-resolved from the same LR image. As a result, it is hard to directly learn a promising SR mapping from such a large space. Second, it is often inevitable to develop very large models with extremely high computational cost to yield promising SR performance. In practice, one can use model compression techniques to obtain compact models by reducing model redundancy. Nevertheless, it is hard for existing model compression methods to accurately identify the redundant components due to the extremely large SR mapping space. To alleviate the first challenge, we propose a dual regression learning scheme to reduce the space of possible SR mappings. Specifically, in addition to the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping to estimate the downsampling kernel and reconstruct LR images. In this way, the dual mapping acts as a constraint to reduce the space of possible mappings. To address the second challenge, we propose a dual regression compression (DRC) method to reduce model redundancy in both layer-level and channel-level based on channel pruning. Specifically, we first develop a channel number search method that minimizes the dual regression loss to determine the redundancy of each layer. Given the searched channel numbers, we further exploit the dual regression manner to evaluate the importance of channels and prune the redundant ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in obtaining accurate and efficient SR models."
2207.08352,Show Me What I Like: Detecting User-Specific Video Highlights Using   Content-Based Multi-Head Attention,"We propose a method to detect individualized highlights for users on given target videos based on their preferred highlight clips marked on previous videos they have watched. Our method explicitly leverages the contents of both the preferred clips and the target videos using pre-trained features for the objects and the human activities. We design a multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively weigh the preferred clips based on their object- and human-activity-based contents, and fuse them using these weights into a single feature representation for each user. We compute similarities between these per-user feature representations and the per-frame features computed from the desired target videos to estimate the user-specific highlight clips from the target videos. We test our method on a large-scale highlight detection dataset containing the annotated highlights of individual users. Compared to current baselines, we observe an absolute improvement of 2-4% in the mean average precision of the detected highlights. We also perform extensive ablation experiments on the number of preferred highlight clips associated with each user as well as on the object- and human-activity-based feature representations to validate that our method is indeed both content-based and user-specific."
2207.08569,Multi-manifold Attention for Vision Transformers,"Vision Transformers are very popular nowadays due to their state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks, such as image classification and action recognition. Although their performance has been greatly enhanced through highly descriptive patch embeddings and hierarchical structures, there is still limited research on utilizing additional data representations so as to refine the selfattention map of a Transformer. To address this problem, a novel attention mechanism, called multi-manifold multihead attention, is proposed in this work to substitute the vanilla self-attention of a Transformer. The proposed mechanism models the input space in three distinct manifolds, namely Euclidean, Symmetric Positive Definite and Grassmann, thus leveraging different statistical and geometrical properties of the input for the computation of a highly descriptive attention map. In this way, the proposed attention mechanism can guide a Vision Transformer to become more attentive towards important appearance, color and texture features of an image, leading to improved classification and segmentation results, as shown by the experimental results on well-known datasets."
2207.08794,D$^3$FlowSLAM: Self-Supervised Dynamic SLAM with Flow Motion   Decomposition and DINO Guidance,"In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised deep SLAM method that robustly operates in dynamic scenes while accurately identifying dynamic components. Our method leverages a dual-flow representation for static flow and dynamic flow, facilitating effective scene decomposition in dynamic environments. We propose a dynamic update module based on this representation and develop a dense SLAM system that excels in dynamic scenarios. In addition, we design a self-supervised training scheme using DINO as a prior, enabling label-free training. Our method achieves superior accuracy compared to other self-supervised methods. It also matches or even surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods in some cases. All code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance."
2207.08808,Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network for Ultra High-Resolution Image   Restoration,"While the research on image background restoration from regular size of degraded images has achieved remarkable progress, restoring ultra high-resolution (e.g., 4K) images remains an extremely challenging task due to the explosion of computational complexity and memory usage, as well as the deficiency of annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model for ultra high-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy involving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway. The local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained manner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway performs image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to provide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and noise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways, our GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects in terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and high-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work, we also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both reflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and synthetic images. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain streak removal and image dehazing, show that our GLSGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2207.08878,A hierarchical semantic segmentation framework for computer vision-based   bridge damage detection,"Computer vision-based damage detection using remote cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables efficient and low-cost bridge health monitoring that reduces labor costs and the needs for sensor installation and maintenance. By leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to find regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the pixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform poorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin objects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest are highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic segmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship between component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete cracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will be masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection model could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and avoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale augmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves contextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling small and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important sampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g., railway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which addresses the imbalanced data challenge."
2207.08920,Recognizing Hand Use and Hand Role at Home After Stroke from Egocentric   Video,"Introduction: Hand function is a central determinant of independence after stroke. Measuring hand use in the home environment is necessary to evaluate the impact of new interventions, and calls for novel wearable technologies. Egocentric video can capture hand-object interactions in context, as well as show how more-affected hands are used during bilateral tasks (for stabilization or manipulation). Automated methods are required to extract this information. Objective: To use artificial intelligence-based computer vision to classify hand use and hand role from egocentric videos recorded at home after stroke. Methods: Twenty-one stroke survivors participated in the study. A random forest classifier, a SlowFast neural network, and the Hand Object Detector neural network were applied to identify hand use and hand role at home. Leave-One-Subject-Out-Cross-Validation (LOSOCV) was used to evaluate the performance of the three models. Between-group differences of the models were calculated based on the Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: For hand use detection, the Hand Object Detector had significantly higher performance than the other models. The macro average MCCs using this model in the LOSOCV were 0.50 +- 0.23 for the more-affected hands and 0.58 +- 0.18 for the less-affected hands. Hand role classification had macro average MCCs in the LOSOCV that were close to zero for all models. Conclusion: Using egocentric video to capture the hand use of stroke survivors at home is feasible. Pose estimation to track finger movements may be beneficial to classifying hand roles in the future."
2207.08960,Enhancing Space-time Video Super-resolution via Spatial-temporal Feature   Interaction,"The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/yuezijie/STINet-Space-time-Video-Super-resolution."
2207.09240,IDET: Iterative Difference-Enhanced Transformers for High-Quality Change   Detection,"Change detection (CD) aims to detect change regions within an image pair captured at different times, playing a significant role in diverse real-world applications. Nevertheless, most of the existing works focus on designing advanced network architectures to map the feature difference to the final change map while ignoring the influence of the quality of the feature difference. In this paper, we study the CD from a different perspective, i.e., how to optimize the feature difference to highlight changes and suppress unchanged regions, and propose a novel module denoted as iterative difference-enhanced transformers (IDET). IDET contains three transformers: two transformers for extracting the long-range information of the two images and one transformer for enhancing the feature difference. In contrast to the previous transformers, the third transformer takes the outputs of the first two transformers to guide the enhancement of the feature difference iteratively. To achieve more effective refinement, we further propose the multi-scale IDET-based change detection that uses multi-scale representations of the images for multiple feature difference refinements and proposes a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy to combine all refinements. Our final CD method outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods on six large-scale datasets under diverse application scenarios, which demonstrates the importance of feature difference enhancements and the effectiveness of IDET."
2207.09339,Vision Transformers: From Semantic Segmentation to Dense Prediction,"The emergence of vision transformers (ViTs) in image classification has shifted the methodologies for visual representation learning. In particular, ViTs learn visual representation at full receptive field per layer across all the image patches, in comparison to the increasing receptive fields of CNNs across layers and other alternatives (e.g., large kernels and atrous convolution). In this work, for the first time we explore the global context learning potentials of ViTs for dense visual prediction (e.g., semantic segmentation). Our motivation is that through learning global context at full receptive field layer by layer, ViTs may capture stronger long-range dependency information, critical for dense prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that encoding an image as a sequence of patches, a vanilla ViT without local convolution and resolution reduction can yield stronger visual representation for semantic segmentation. For example, our model, termed as SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR), excels on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU, the first position in the test leaderboard on the day of submission) and performs competitively on Cityscapes. However, the basic ViT architecture falls short in broader dense prediction applications, such as object detection and instance segmentation, due to its lack of a pyramidal structure, high computational demand, and insufficient local context. For tackling general dense visual prediction tasks in a cost-effective manner, we further formulate a family of Hierarchical Local-Global (HLG) Transformers, characterized by local attention within windows and global-attention across windows in a pyramidal architecture. Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve appealing performance on a variety of dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection and instance segmentation and semantic segmentation) as well as image classification."
2207.09792,Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection via Pattern Generative and   Contrastive Networks,"It is hard to collect enough flaw images for training deep learning network in industrial production. Therefore, existing industrial anomaly detection methods prefer to use CNN-based unsupervised detection and localization network to achieve this task. However, these methods always fail when there are varieties happened in new signals since traditional end-to-end networks suffer barriers of fitting nonlinear model in high-dimensional space. Moreover, they have a memory library by clustering the feature of normal images essentially, which cause it is not robust to texture change. To this end, we propose the Vision Transformer based (VIT-based) unsupervised anomaly detection network. It utilizes a hierarchical task learning and human experience to enhance its interpretability. Our network consists of pattern generation and comparison networks. Pattern generation network uses two VIT-based encoder modules to extract the feature of two consecutive image patches, then uses VIT-based decoder module to learn the human designed style of these features and predict the third image patch. After this, we use the Siamese-based network to compute the similarity of the generation image patch and original image patch. Finally, we refine the anomaly localization by the bi-directional inference strategy. Comparison experiments on public dataset MVTec dataset show our method achieves 99.8% AUC, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we give a qualitative illustration on our own leather and cloth datasets. The accurate segment results strongly prove the accuracy of our method in anomaly detection."
2207.09934,DeepIPC: Deeply Integrated Perception and Control for an Autonomous   Vehicle in Real Environments,"In this work, we introduce DeepIPC, a novel end-to-end model tailored for autonomous driving, which seamlessly integrates perception and control tasks. Unlike traditional models that handle these tasks separately, DeepIPC innovatively combines a perception module, which processes RGBD images for semantic segmentation and generates bird's eye view (BEV) mappings, with a controller module that utilizes these insights along with GNSS and angular speed measurements to accurately predict navigational waypoints. This integration allows DeepIPC to efficiently translate complex environmental data into actionable driving commands. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates DeepIPC's superior performance in terms of drivability and multi-task efficiency across diverse real-world scenarios, setting a new benchmark for end-to-end autonomous driving systems with a leaner model architecture. The experimental results underscore DeepIPC's potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicular navigation, promising a step forward in the development of autonomous driving technologies. For further insights and replication, we will make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/oskarnatan/DeepIPC."
2207.10022,Secrets of Event-Based Optical Flow,"Event cameras respond to scene dynamics and offer advantages to estimate motion. Following recent image-based deep-learning achievements, optical flow estimation methods for event cameras have rushed to combine those image-based methods with event data. However, it requires several adaptations (data conversion, loss function, etc.) as they have very different properties. We develop a principled method to extend the Contrast Maximization framework to estimate optical flow from events alone. We investigate key elements: how to design the objective function to prevent overfitting, how to warp events to deal better with occlusions, and how to improve convergence with multi-scale raw events. With these key elements, our method ranks first among unsupervised methods on the MVSEC benchmark, and is competitive on the DSEC benchmark. Moreover, our method allows us to expose the issues of the ground truth flow in those benchmarks, and produces remarkable results when it is transferred to unsupervised learning settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/tub-rip/event_based_optical_flow"
2207.10324,Enhancing Generative Networks for Chest Anomaly Localization through   Automatic Registration-Based Unpaired-to-Pseudo-Paired Training Data   Translation,"Image translation based on a generative adversarial network (GAN-IT) is a promising method for the precise localization of abnormal regions in chest X-ray images (AL-CXR) even without the pixel-level annotation. However, heterogeneous unpaired datasets undermine existing methods to extract key features and distinguish normal from abnormal cases, resulting in inaccurate and unstable AL-CXR. To address this problem, we propose an improved two-stage GAN-IT involving registration and data augmentation. For the first stage, we introduce an advanced deep-learning-based registration technique that virtually and reasonably converts unpaired data into paired data for learning registration maps, by sequentially utilizing linear-based global and uniform coordinate transformation and AI-based non-linear coordinate fine-tuning. This approach enables independent and complex coordinate transformation of each detailed location of the lung while recognizing the entire lung structure, thereby achieving higher registration performance with resolving inherent artifacts caused by unpaired conditions. For the second stage, we apply data augmentation to diversify anomaly locations by swapping the left and right lung regions on the uniform registered frames, further improving the performance by alleviating imbalance in data distribution showing left and right lung lesions. The proposed method is model agnostic and shows consistent AL-CXR performance improvement in representative AI models. Therefore, we believe GAN-IT for AL-CXR can be clinically implemented by using our basis framework, even if learning data are scarce or difficult for the pixel-level disease annotation."
2207.10971,Kinematics Modeling Network for Video-based Human Pose Estimation,"Estimating human poses from videos is critical in human-computer interaction. Joints cooperate rather than move independently during human movement. There are both spatial and temporal correlations between joints. Despite the positive results of previous approaches, most focus on modeling the spatial correlation between joints while only straightforwardly integrating features along the temporal dimension, ignoring the temporal correlation between joints. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play kinematics modeling module (KMM) to explicitly model temporal correlations between joints across different frames by calculating their temporal similarity. In this way, KMM can capture motion cues of the current joint relative to all joints in different time. Besides, we formulate video-based human pose estimation as a Markov Decision Process and design a novel kinematics modeling network (KIMNet) to simulate the Markov Chain, allowing KIMNet to locate joints recursively. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks. In particular, KIMNet shows robustness to the occlusion. The code will be released at https://github.com/YHDang/KIMNet."
2207.11081,Emotion Separation and Recognition from a Facial Expression by   Generating the Poker Face with Vision Transformers,"Representation learning and feature disentanglement have garnered significant research interest in the field of facial expression recognition (FER). The inherent ambiguity of emotion labels poses challenges for conventional supervised representation learning methods. Moreover, directly learning the mapping from a facial expression image to an emotion label lacks explicit supervision signals for capturing fine-grained facial features. In this paper, we propose a novel FER model, named Poker Face Vision Transformer or PF-ViT, to address these challenges. PF-ViT aims to separate and recognize the disturbance-agnostic emotion from a static facial image via generating its corresponding poker face, without the need for paired images. Inspired by the Facial Action Coding System, we regard an expressive face as the combined result of a set of facial muscle movements on one's poker face (i.e., an emotionless face). PF-ViT utilizes vanilla Vision Transformers, and its components are firstly pre-trained as Masked Autoencoders on a large facial expression dataset without emotion labels, yielding excellent representations. Subsequently, we train PF-ViT using a GAN framework. During training, the auxiliary task of poke face generation promotes the disentanglement between emotional and emotion-irrelevant components, guiding the FER model to holistically capture discriminative facial details. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods on four popular FER datasets."
2207.11230,You Actually Look Twice At it (YALTAi): using an object detection   approach instead of region segmentation within the Kraken engine,"Layout Analysis (the identification of zones and their classification) is the first step along line segmentation in Optical Character Recognition and similar tasks. The ability of identifying main body of text from marginal text or running titles makes the difference between extracting the work full text of a digitized book and noisy outputs. We show that most segmenters focus on pixel classification and that polygonization of this output has not been used as a target for the latest competition on historical document (ICDAR 2017 and onwards), despite being the focus in the early 2010s. We propose to shift, for efficiency, the task from a pixel classification-based polygonization to an object detection using isothetic rectangles. We compare the output of Kraken and YOLOv5 in terms of segmentation and show that the later severely outperforms the first on small datasets (1110 samples and below). We release two datasets for training and evaluation on historical documents as well as a new package, YALTAi, which injects YOLOv5 in the segmentation pipeline of Kraken 4.1."
2207.11581,Self-supervised contrastive learning of echocardiogram videos enables   label-efficient cardiac disease diagnosis,"Advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown that self-supervised pretraining on medical imaging data can provide a strong initialization for downstream supervised classification and segmentation. Given the difficulty of obtaining expert labels for medical image recognition tasks, such an ""in-domain"" SSL initialization is often desirable due to its improved label efficiency over standard transfer learning. However, most efforts toward SSL of medical imaging data are not adapted to video-based medical imaging modalities. With this progress in mind, we developed a self-supervised contrastive learning approach, EchoCLR, catered to echocardiogram videos with the goal of learning strong representations for efficient fine-tuning on downstream cardiac disease diagnosis. EchoCLR leverages (i) distinct videos of the same patient as positive pairs for contrastive learning and (ii) a frame re-ordering pretext task to enforce temporal coherence. When fine-tuned on small portions of labeled data (as few as 51 exams), EchoCLR pretraining significantly improved classification performance for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and aortic stenosis (AS) over other transfer learning and SSL approaches across internal and external test sets. For example, when fine-tuning on 10% of available training data (519 studies), an EchoCLR-pretrained model achieved 0.72 AUROC (95% CI: [0.69, 0.75]) on LVH classification, compared to 0.61 AUROC (95% CI: [0.57, 0.64]) with a standard transfer learning approach. Similarly, using 1% of available training data (53 studies), EchoCLR pretraining achieved 0.82 AUROC (95% CI: [0.79, 0.84]) on severe AS classification, compared to 0.61 AUROC (95% CI: [0.58, 0.65]) with transfer learning. EchoCLR is unique in its ability to learn representations of medical videos and demonstrates that SSL can enable label-efficient disease classification from small, labeled datasets."
2207.11678,Quad-Net: Quad-domain Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction,"Metal implants and other high-density objects in patients introduce severe streaking artifacts in CT images, compromising image quality and diagnostic performance. Although various methods were developed for CT metal artifact reduction over the past decades, including the latest dual-domain deep networks, remaining metal artifacts are still clinically challenging in many cases. Here we extend the state-of-the-art dual-domain deep network approach into a quad-domain counterpart so that all the features in the sinogram, image, and their corresponding Fourier domains are synergized to eliminate metal artifacts optimally without compromising structural subtleties. Our proposed quad-domain network for MAR, referred to as Quad-Net, takes little additional computational cost since the Fourier transform is highly efficient, and works across the four receptive fields to learn both global and local features as well as their relations. Specifically, we first design a Sinogram-Fourier Restoration Network (SFR-Net) in the sinogram domain and its Fourier space to faithfully inpaint metal-corrupted traces. Then, we couple SFR-Net with an Image-Fourier Refinement Network (IFR-Net) which takes both an image and its Fourier spectrum to improve a CT image reconstructed from the SFR-Net output using cross-domain contextual information. Quad-Net is trained on clinical datasets to minimize a composite loss function. Quad-Net does not require precise metal masks, which is of great importance in clinical practice. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Quad-Net over the state-of-the-art MAR methods quantitatively, visually, and statistically. The Quad-Net code is publicly available at https://github.com/longzilicart/Quad-Net."
2207.11718,TIPS: Text-Induced Pose Synthesis,"In computer vision, human pose synthesis and transfer deal with probabilistic image generation of a person in a previously unseen pose from an already available observation of that person. Though researchers have recently proposed several methods to achieve this task, most of these techniques derive the target pose directly from the desired target image on a specific dataset, making the underlying process challenging to apply in real-world scenarios as the generation of the target image is the actual aim. In this paper, we first present the shortcomings of current pose transfer algorithms and then propose a novel text-based pose transfer technique to address those issues. We divide the problem into three independent stages: (a) text to pose representation, (b) pose refinement, and (c) pose rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to develop a text-based pose transfer framework where we also introduce a new dataset DF-PASS, by adding descriptive pose annotations for the images of the DeepFashion dataset. The proposed method generates promising results with significant qualitative and quantitative scores in our experiments."
2207.11720,Progressive Feature Learning for Realistic Cloth-Changing Gait   Recognition,"Gait recognition is instrumental in crime prevention and social security, for it can be conducted at a long distance to figure out the identity of persons. However, existing datasets and methods cannot satisfactorily deal with the most challenging cloth-changing problem in practice. Specifically, the practical gait models are usually trained on automatically labeled data, in which the sequences' views and cloth conditions of each person have some restrictions. To be concrete, the cross-view sub-dataset only has normal walking condition without cloth-changing, while the cross-cloth sub-dataset has cloth-changing sequences but only in front views. As a result, the cloth-changing accuracy cannot meet practical requirements. In this work, we formulate the problem as Realistic Cloth-Changing Gait Recognition (abbreviated as RCC-GR) and we construct two benchmarks: CASIA-BN-RCC and OUMVLP-RCC, to simulate the above setting. Furthermore, we propose a new framework called Progressive Feature Learning that can be applied with off-the-shelf backbones to improve their performance in RCC-GR. Specifically, in our framework, we design Progressive Mapping and Progressive Uncertainty to extract cross-view features and then extract cross-cloth features on the basis. In this way, the feature from the cross-view sub-dataset can first dominate the feature space and relieve the uneven distribution caused by the adverse effect from the cross-cloth sub-dataset. The experiments on our benchmarks show that our framework can effectively improve recognition performance, especially in the cloth-changing conditions."
2207.11759,Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person   Re-identification on Distributed Edges,"Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%. All implementation codes are publicly available on https://github.com/MSNLAB/Federated-Lifelong-Person-ReID"
2207.11860,Behind Every Domain There is a Shift: Adapting Distortion-aware Vision   Transformers for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we address panoramic semantic segmentation which is under-explored due to two critical challenges: (1) image distortions and object deformations on panoramas; (2) lack of semantic annotations in the 360{\deg} imagery. To tackle these problems, first, we propose the upgraded Transformer for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation, i.e., Trans4PASS+, equipped with Deformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLPv2) modules for handling object deformations and image distortions whenever (before or after adaptation) and wherever (shallow or deep levels). Second, we enhance the Mutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) strategy via pseudo-label rectification for unsupervised domain adaptive panoramic segmentation. Third, aside from Pinhole-to-Panoramic (Pin2Pan) adaptation, we create a new dataset (SynPASS) with 9,080 panoramic images, facilitating Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) adaptation scheme in 360{\deg} imagery. Extensive experiments are conducted, which cover indoor and outdoor scenarios, and each of them is investigated with Pin2Pan and Syn2Real regimens. Trans4PASS+ achieves state-of-the-art performances on four domain adaptive panoramic semantic segmentation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/jamycheung/Trans4PASS."
2207.12080,Intention-Conditioned Long-Term Human Egocentric Action Forecasting,"To anticipate how a human would act in the future, it is essential to understand the human intention since it guides the human towards a certain goal. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture which assumes a sequence of human action (low-level) can be driven from the human intention (high-level). Based on this, we deal with Long-Term Action Anticipation task in egocentric videos. Our framework first extracts two level of human information over the N observed videos human actions through a Hierarchical Multi-task MLP Mixer (H3M). Then, we condition the uncertainty of the future through an Intention-Conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (I-CVAE) that generates K stable predictions of the next Z=20 actions that the observed human might perform. By leveraging human intention as high-level information, we claim that our model is able to anticipate more time-consistent actions in the long-term, thus improving the results over baseline methods in EGO4D Challenge. This work ranked first in both CVPR@2022 and ECVV@2022 EGO4D LTA Challenge by providing more plausible anticipated sequences, improving the anticipation of nouns and overall actions.

2207.12163,Multi-Scale RAFT: Combining Hierarchical Concepts for Learning-based Optical FLow Estimation,"Many classical and learning-based optical flow methods rely on hierarchical concepts to improve both accuracy and robustness. However, one of the currently most successful approaches -- RAFT -- hardly exploits such concepts. In this work, we show that multi-scale ideas are still valuable. More precisely, using RAFT as a baseline, we propose a novel multi-scale neural network that combines several hierarchical concepts within a single estimation framework. These concepts include (i) a partially shared coarse-to-fine architecture, (ii) multi-scale features, (iii) a hierarchical cost volume and (iv) a multi-scale multi-iteration loss. Experiments on MPI Sintel and KITTI clearly demonstrate the benefits of our approach. They show not only substantial improvements compared to RAFT, but also state-of-the-art results -- in particular in non-occluded regions. Code will be available at https://github.com/cv-stuttgart/MS_RAFT."
2207.12554,Inter-Frame Compression for Dynamic Point Cloud Geometry Coding,"Efficient point cloud compression is essential for applications like virtual and mixed reality, autonomous driving, and cultural heritage. This paper proposes a deep learning-based inter-frame encoding scheme for dynamic point cloud geometry compression. We propose a lossy geometry compression scheme that predicts the latent representation of the current frame using the previous frame by employing a novel feature space inter-prediction network. The proposed network utilizes sparse convolutions with hierarchical multiscale 3D feature learning to encode the current frame using the previous frame. The proposed method introduces a novel predictor network for motion compensation in the feature domain to map the latent representation of the previous frame to the coordinates of the current frame to predict the current frame's feature embedding. The framework transmits the residual of the predicted features and the actual features by compressing them using a learned probabilistic factorized entropy model. At the receiver, the decoder hierarchically reconstructs the current frame by progressively rescaling the feature embedding. The proposed framework is compared to the state-of-the-art Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC) and Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) schemes standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The proposed method achieves more than 88% BD-Rate (Bjontegaard Delta Rate) reduction against G-PCCv20 Octree, more than 56% BD-Rate savings against G-PCCv20 Trisoup, more than 62% BD-Rate reduction against V-PCC intra-frame encoding mode, and more than 52% BD-Rate savings against V-PCC P-frame-based inter-frame encoding mode using HEVC. These significant performance gains are cross-checked and verified in the MPEG working group."
2207.12585,PTGCF: Printing Texture Guided Color Fusion for Impressionism Oil   Painting Style Rendering,"As a major branch of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR), image stylization mainly uses the computer algorithms to render a photo into an artistic painting. Recent work has shown that the extraction of style information such as stroke texture and color of the target style image is the key to image stylization. Given its stroke texture and color characteristics, a new stroke rendering method is proposed, which fully considers the tonal characteristics and the representative color of the original oil painting, in order to fit the tone of the original oil painting image into the stylized image and make it close to the artist's creative effect. The experiments have validated the efficacy of the proposed model. This method would be more suitable for the works of pointillism painters with a relatively uniform sense of direction, especially for natural scenes. When the original painting brush strokes have a clearer sense of direction, using this method to simulate brushwork texture features can be less satisfactory."
2207.12730,P2ANet: A Dataset and Benchmark for Dense Action Detection from Table   Tennis Match Broadcasting Videos,"While deep learning has been widely used for video analytics, such as video classification and action detection, dense action detection with fast-moving subjects from sports videos is still challenging. In this work, we release yet another sports video benchmark \TheName{} for \emph{\underline{P}}ing \emph{\underline{P}}ong-\emph{\underline{A}}ction detection, which consists of 2,721 video clips collected from the broadcasting videos of professional table tennis matches in World Table Tennis Championships and Olympiads. We work with a crew of table tennis professionals and referees on a specially designed annotation toolbox to obtain fine-grained action labels (in 14 classes) for every ping-pong action that appeared in the dataset, and formulate two sets of action detection problems -- \emph{action localization} and \emph{action recognition}. We evaluate a number of commonly-seen action recognition (e.g., TSM, TSN, Video SwinTransformer, and Slowfast) and action localization models (e.g., BSN, BSN++, BMN, TCANet), using \TheName{} for both problems, under various settings. These models can only achieve 48\% area under the AR-AN curve for localization and 82\% top-one accuracy for recognition since the ping-pong actions are dense with fast-moving subjects but broadcasting videos are with only 25 FPS. The results confirm that \TheName{} is still a challenging task and can be used as a special benchmark for dense action detection from videos."
2207.12886,Detection of road traffic crashes based on collision estimation,"This paper introduces a framework based on computer vision that can detect road traffic crashes (RCTs) by using the installed surveillance/CCTV camera and report them to the emergency in real-time with the exact location and time of occurrence of the accident. The framework is built of five modules. We start with the detection of vehicles by using YOLO architecture; The second module is the tracking of vehicles using MOSSE tracker, Then the third module is a new approach to detect accidents based on collision estimation. Then the fourth module for each vehicle, we detect if there is a car accident or not based on the violent flow descriptor (ViF) followed by an SVM classifier for crash prediction. Finally, in the last stage, if there is a car accident, the system will send a notification to the emergency by using a GPS module that provides us with the location, time, and date of the accident to be sent to the emergency with the help of the GSM module. The main objective is to achieve higher accuracy with fewer false alarms and to implement a simple system based on pipelining technique."
2207.13021,CTVR-EHO TDA-IPH Topological Optimized Convolutional Visual Recurrent   Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification,"In today's world of health care, brain tumor detection has become common. However, the manual brain tumor classification approach is time-consuming. So Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is used by many researchers in the medical field for making accurate diagnoses and aiding in the patient's treatment. The traditional techniques have problems such as overfitting and the inability to extract necessary features. To overcome these problems, we developed the Topological Data Analysis based Improved Persistent Homology (TDA-IPH) and Convolutional Transfer learning and Visual Recurrent learning with Elephant Herding Optimization hyper-parameter tuning (CTVR-EHO) models for brain tumor segmentation and classification. Initially, the Topological Data Analysis based Improved Persistent Homology is designed to segment the brain tumor image. Then, from the segmented image, features are extracted using TL via the AlexNet model and Bidirectional Visual Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-VLSTM). Next, elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) is used to tune the hyperparameters of both networks to get an optimal result. Finally, extracted features are concatenated and classified using the softmax activation layer. The simulation result of this proposed CTVR-EHO and TDA-IPH method is analyzed based on precision, accuracy, recall, loss, and F score metrics. When compared to other existing brain tumor segmentation and classification models, the proposed CTVR-EHO and TDA-IPH approaches show high accuracy (99.8%), high recall (99.23%), high precision (99.67%), and high F score (99.59%)."
2207.13137,Bayesian Evidential Learning for Few-Shot Classification,"Few-Shot Classification(FSC) aims to generalize from base classes to novel classes given very limited labeled samples, which is an important step on the path toward human-like machine learning. State-of-the-art solutions involve learning to find a good metric and representation space to compute the distance between samples. Despite the promising accuracy performance, how to model uncertainty for metric-based FSC methods effectively is still a challenge. To model uncertainty, We place a distribution over class probability based on the theory of evidence. As a result, uncertainty modeling and metric learning can be decoupled. To reduce the uncertainty of classification, we propose a Bayesian evidence fusion theorem. Given observed samples, the network learns to get posterior distribution parameters given the prior parameters produced by the pre-trained network. Detailed gradient analysis shows that our method provides a smooth optimization target and can capture the uncertainty. The proposed method is agnostic to metric learning strategies and can be implemented as a plug-and-play module. We integrate our method into several newest FSC methods and demonstrate the improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification on standard FSC benchmarks."
2207.13165,YOLO and Mask R-CNN for Vehicle Number Plate Identification,"License plate scanners have grown in popularity in parking lots during the past few years. In order to quickly identify license plates, traditional plate recognition devices used in parking lots employ a fixed source of light and shooting angles. For skewed angles, such as license plate images taken with ultra-wide angle or fisheye lenses, deformation of the license plate recognition plate can also be quite severe, impairing the ability of standard license plate recognition systems to identify the plate. Mask RCNN gadget that may be utilised for oblique pictures and various shooting angles. The results of the experiments show that the suggested design will be capable of classifying license plates with bevel angles larger than 0/60. Character recognition using the suggested Mask R-CNN approach has advanced significantly as well. The proposed Mask R-CNN method has also achieved significant progress in character recognition, which is tilted more than 45 degrees as compared to the strategy of employing the YOLOv2 model. Experiment results also suggest that the methodology presented in the open data plate collecting is better than other techniques (known as the AOLP dataset)."
2207.13295,Applied Computer Vision on 2-Dimensional Lung X-Ray Images for Assisted   Medical Diagnosis of Pneumonia,"This study focuses on the application of a specific subfield of artificial intelligence referred to as computer vision in the analysis of 2-dimensional lung x-ray images for the assisted medical diagnosis of ordinary pneumonia.   A convolutional neural network algorithm was implemented in a Python-coded, Flask-based web application that can analyze x-ray images for the detection of ordinary pneumonia. Since convolutional neural network algorithms rely on machine learning for the identification and detection of patterns, a technique referred to as transfer learning was implemented to train the neural network in the identification and detection of patterns within the dataset. Open-source lung x-ray images were used as training data to create a knowledge base that served as the core element of the web application and the experimental design employed a 5-Trial Confirmatory Test for the validation of the web application.   The results of the 5-Trial Confirmatory Test show the calculation of Diagnostic Precision Percentage per Trial, General Diagnostic Precision Percentage, and General Diagnostic Error Percentage while the Confusion Matrix further shows the relationship between the label and the corresponding diagnosis result of the web application on each test images.   The developed web application can be used by medical practitioners in A.I.-assisted diagnosis of ordinary pneumonia, and by researchers in the fields of computer science and bioinformatics."
2207.13316,NICEST: Noisy Label Correction and Training for Robust Scene Graph   Generation,"Nearly all existing scene graph generation (SGG) models have overlooked the ground-truth annotation qualities of mainstream SGG datasets, i.e., they assume: 1) all the manually annotated positive samples are equally correct; 2) all the un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper, we argue that neither of the assumptions applies to SGG: there are numerous noisy ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions and harm the training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we propose a novel NoIsy label CorrEction and Sample Training strategy for SGG: NICEST. Specifically, it consists of two parts: NICE and NIST, which rule out these noisy label issues by generating high-quality samples and the effective training strategy, respectively. NICE first detects noisy samples and then reassigns them more high-quality soft predicate labels. NIST is a multi-teacher knowledge distillation based training strategy, which enables the model to learn unbiased fusion knowledge. And a dynamic trade-off weighting strategy in NIST is designed to penalize the bias of different teachers. Due to the model-agnostic nature of both NICE and NIST, our NICEST can be seamlessly incorporated into any SGG architecture to boost its performance on different predicate categories. In addition, to better evaluate the generalization of SGG models, we further propose a new benchmark VG-OOD, by re-organizing the prevalent VG dataset and deliberately making the predicate distributions of the training and test sets as different as possible for each subject-object category pair. This new benchmark helps disentangle the influence of subject-object category based frequency biases. Extensive ablations and results on different backbones and tasks have attested to the effectiveness and generalization ability of each component of NICEST."
2207.13532,Contrastive Masked Autoencoders are Stronger Vision Learners,"Masked image modeling (MIM) has achieved promising results on various vision tasks. However, the limited discriminability of learned representation manifests there is still plenty to go for making a stronger vision learner. Towards this goal, we propose Contrastive Masked Autoencoders (CMAE), a new self-supervised pre-training method for learning more comprehensive and capable vision representations. By elaboratively unifying contrastive learning (CL) and masked image model (MIM) through novel designs, CMAE leverages their respective advantages and learns representations with both strong instance discriminability and local perceptibility. Specifically, CMAE consists of two branches where the online branch is an asymmetric encoder-decoder and the momentum branch is a momentum updated encoder. During training, the online encoder reconstructs original images from latent representations of masked images to learn holistic features. The momentum encoder, fed with the full images, enhances the feature discriminability via contrastive learning with its online counterpart. To make CL compatible with MIM, CMAE introduces two new components, i.e. pixel shifting for generating plausible positive views and feature decoder for complementing features of contrastive pairs. Thanks to these novel designs, CMAE effectively improves the representation quality and transfer performance over its MIM counterpart. CMAE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on highly competitive benchmarks of image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Notably, CMAE-Base achieves $85.3\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and $52.5\%$ mIoU on ADE20k, surpassing previous best results by $0.7\%$ and $1.8\%$ respectively. The source code is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/ZhichengHuang/CMAE}."
2207.13551,A Proper Orthogonal Decomposition approach for parameters reduction of   Single Shot Detector networks,"As a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence and deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved an impressive success in solving many problems in several fields including computer vision and image processing. Real-time performance, robustness of algorithms and fast training processes remain open problems in these contexts. In addition object recognition and detection are challenging tasks for resource-constrained embedded systems, commonly used in the industrial sector. To overcome these issues, we propose a dimensionality reduction framework based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, a classical model order reduction technique, in order to gain a reduction in the number of hyperparameters of the net. We have applied such framework to SSD300 architecture using PASCAL VOC dataset, demonstrating a reduction of the network dimension and a remarkable speedup in the fine-tuning of the network in a transfer learning context."
2207.13560,D3C2-Net: Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network for Compressive Sensing,"By mapping iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks (NNs), deep unfolding networks (DUNs) exhibit well-defined and interpretable structures and achieve remarkable success in the field of compressive sensing (CS). However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability. Code is available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/D3C2-Net."
2207.14042,Robust Self-Tuning Data Association for Geo-Referencing Using Lane   Markings,"Localization in aerial imagery-based maps offers many advantages, such as global consistency, geo-referenced maps, and the availability of publicly accessible data. However, the landmarks that can be observed from both aerial imagery and on-board sensors is limited. This leads to ambiguities or aliasing during the data association.   Building upon a highly informative representation (that allows efficient data association), this paper presents a complete pipeline for resolving these ambiguities. Its core is a robust self-tuning data association that adapts the search area depending on the entropy of the measurements. Additionally, to smooth the final result, we adjust the information matrix for the associated data as a function of the relative transform produced by the data association process.   We evaluate our method on real data from urban and rural scenarios around the city of Karlsruhe in Germany. We compare state-of-the-art outlier mitigation methods with our self-tuning approach, demonstrating a considerable improvement, especially for outer-urban scenarios."
2207.14425,3D Cartoon Face Generation with Controllable Expressions from a Single GAN Image,"In this paper, we investigate an open research task of generating 3D cartoon face shapes from single 2D GAN generated human faces and without 3D supervision, where we can also manipulate the facial expressions of the 3D shapes. To this end, we discover the semantic meanings of StyleGAN latent space, such that we are able to produce face images of various expressions, poses, and lighting conditions by controlling the latent codes. Specifically, we first finetune the pretrained StyleGAN face model on the cartoon datasets. By feeding the same latent codes to face and cartoon generation models, we aim to realize the translation from 2D human face images to cartoon styled avatars. We then discover semantic directions of the GAN latent space, in an attempt to change the facial expressions while preserving the original identity. As we do not have any 3D annotations for cartoon faces, we manipulate the latent codes to generate images with different poses and lighting conditions, such that we can reconstruct the 3D cartoon face shapes. We validate the efficacy of our method on three cartoon datasets qualitatively and quantitatively."
2207.14466,Towards Domain-agnostic Depth Completion,"Existing depth completion methods are often targeted at a specific sparse depth type and generalize poorly across task domains. We present a method to complete sparse/semi-dense, noisy, and potentially low-resolution depth maps obtained by various range sensors, including those in modern mobile phones, or by multi-view reconstruction algorithms. Our method leverages a data-driven prior in the form of a single image depth prediction network trained on large-scale datasets, the output of which is used as an input to our model. We propose an effective training scheme where we simulate various sparsity patterns in typical task domains. In addition, we design two new benchmarks to evaluate the generalizability and the robustness of depth completion methods. Our simple method shows superior cross-domain generalization ability against state-of-the-art depth completion methods, introducing a practical solution to high-quality depth capture on a mobile device. The code is available at: https://github.com/YvanYin/FillDepth."
2207.14491,"Conservative Generator, Progressive Discriminator: Coordination of   Adversaries in Few-shot Incremental Image Synthesis","The capacity to learn incrementally from an online stream of data is an envied trait of human learners, as deep neural networks typically suffer from catastrophic forgetting and stability-plasticity dilemma. Several works have previously explored incremental few-shot learning, a task with greater challenges due to data constraint, mostly in classification setting with mild success. In this work, we study the underrepresented task of generative incremental few-shot learning. To effectively handle the inherent challenges of incremental learning and few-shot learning, we propose a novel framework named ConPro that leverages the two-player nature of GANs. Specifically, we design a conservative generator that preserves past knowledge in parameter and compute efficient manner, and a progressive discriminator that learns to reason semantic distances between past and present task samples, minimizing overfitting with few data points and pursuing good forward transfer. We present experiments to validate the effectiveness of ConPro."
2207.14513,Uncertainty-Driven Action Quality Assessment,"Automatic action quality assessment (AQA) has attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications. However, most existing AQA methods employ deterministic models to predict the final score for each action, while overlooking the subjectivity and diversity among expert judges during the scoring process. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model, named Uncertainty-Driven AQA (UD-AQA), to utilize and capture the diversity among multiple judge scores. Specifically, we design a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE)-based module to encode the uncertainty in expert assessment, where multiple judge scores can be produced by sampling latent features from the learned latent space multiple times. To further utilize the uncertainty, we generate the estimation of uncertainty for each prediction, which is employed to re-weight AQA regression loss, effectively reducing the influence of uncertain samples during training. Moreover, we further design an uncertainty-guided training strategy to dynamically adjust the learning order of the samples from low uncertainty to high uncertainty. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves competitive results on three benchmarks including the Olympic events MTL-AQA and FineDiving, and the surgical skill JIGSAWS datasets."
2207.14624,Post-processing of coronary and myocardial spatial data,"Numerical simulations of real-world phenomena require a computational scheme and a computational domain. In the context of haemodynamics, the computational domain is the blood vessel network through which blood flows. Such networks contain millions of vessels that are joined in series and in parallel. It is computationally unfeasible to explicitly simulate blood flow throughout the network. From a single porcine left coronary arterial tree, we develop a data pipeline to obtain computational domains for haemodynamic simulations in the myocardium from a graph representing a partial coronary arterial tree. In addition, we develop a method to ascertain which subregions of the left-ventricular wall are more likely to be perfused via a given artery, using a comparison with the American Heart Association division of the left ventricle for validation."
2207.14626,Restoring Vision in Adverse Weather Conditions with Patch-Based   Denoising Diffusion Models,"Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been of significant interest for various computer vision applications. Recent successful methods rely on the current progress in deep neural network architectural designs (e.g., with vision transformers). Motivated by the recent progress achieved with state-of-the-art conditional generative models, we present a novel patch-based image restoration algorithm based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our patch-based diffusion modeling approach enables size-agnostic image restoration by using a guided denoising process with smoothed noise estimates across overlapping patches during inference. We empirically evaluate our model on benchmark datasets for image desnowing, combined deraining and dehazing, and raindrop removal. We demonstrate our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performances on both weather-specific and multi-weather image restoration, and experimentally show strong generalization to real-world test images."
2207.14650,SYNTA: A novel approach for deep learning-based image analysis in muscle   histopathology using photo-realistic synthetic data,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning (DL) methods are becoming increasingly important in the field of biomedical image analysis. However, to exploit the full potential of such methods, a representative number of experimentally acquired images containing a significant number of manually annotated objects is needed as training data. Here we introduce SYNTA (synthetic data) as a novel approach for the generation of synthetic, photo-realistic, and highly complex biomedical images as training data for DL systems. We show the versatility of our approach in the context of muscle fiber and connective tissue analysis in histological sections. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform robust and expert-level segmentation tasks on previously unseen real-world data, without the need for manual annotations using synthetic training data alone. Being a fully parametric technique, our approach poses an interpretable and controllable alternative to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and has the potential to significantly accelerate quantitative image analysis in a variety of biomedical applications in microscopy and beyond."
2207.14682,Towards Unconstrained Audio Splicing Detection and Localization with   Neural Networks,"Freely available and easy-to-use audio editing tools make it straightforward to perform audio splicing. Convincing forgeries can be created by combining various speech samples from the same person. Detection of such splices is important both in the public sector when considering misinformation, and in a legal context to verify the integrity of evidence. Unfortunately, most existing detection algorithms for audio splicing use handcrafted features and make specific assumptions. However, criminal investigators are often faced with audio samples from unconstrained sources with unknown characteristics, which raises the need for more generally applicable methods.   With this work, we aim to take a first step towards unconstrained audio splicing detection to address this need. We simulate various attack scenarios in the form of post-processing operations that may disguise splicing. We propose a Transformer sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) network for splicing detection and localization. Our extensive evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing dedicated approaches for splicing detection [3, 10] as well as the general-purpose networks EfficientNet [28] and RegNet [25]."
2207.14686,Forensic License Plate Recognition with Compression-Informed   Transformers,"Forensic license plate recognition (FLPR) remains an open challenge in legal contexts such as criminal investigations, where unreadable license plates (LPs) need to be deciphered from highly compressed and/or low resolution footage, e.g., from surveillance cameras. In this work, we propose a side-informed Transformer architecture that embeds knowledge on the input compression level to improve recognition under strong compression. We show the effectiveness of Transformers for license plate recognition (LPR) on a low-quality real-world dataset. We also provide a synthetic dataset that includes strongly degraded, illegible LP images and analyze the impact of knowledge embedding on it. The network outperforms existing FLPR methods and standard state-of-the art image recognition models while requiring less parameters. For the severest degraded images, we can improve recognition by up to 8.9 percent points."
2207.14776,Open-radiomics: A Collection of Standardized Datasets and a Technical   Protocol for Reproducible Radiomics Machine Learning Pipelines,"Background: As an important branch of machine learning pipelines in medical imaging, radiomics faces two major challenges namely reproducibility and accessibility. In this work, we introduce open-radiomics, a set of radiomics datasets along with a comprehensive radiomics pipeline based on our proposed technical protocol to improve the reproducibility of the results. Methods: We curated large-scale radiomics datasets based on three open-source datasets; BraTS 2020 for high-grade glioma (HGG) versus low-grade glioma (LGG) classification and survival analysis, BraTS 2023 for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase classification, and non-small cell lung cancer survival analysis from the Cancer Imaging Archive. Using BraTS 2020 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset, we applied our protocol to 369 brain tumor patients (76 LGG, 293 HGG). Leveraging PyRadiomics for LGG vs. HGG classification, we generated 288 datasets from 4 MRI sequences, 3 binWidths, 6 normalization methods, and 4 tumor subregions. Random Forest classifiers were trained and validated (60%,20%,20%) across 100 different data splits (28,800 test results), evaluating Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). Results: Unlike binWidth and image normalization, tumor subregion and imaging sequence significantly affected performance of the models. T1 contrast-enhanced sequence and the union of Necrotic and the non-enhancing tumor core subregions resulted in the highest AUROCs (average test AUROC 0.951, 95% confidence interval of (0.949, 0.952)). Although several settings and data splits (28 out of 28800) yielded test AUROC of 1, they were irreproducible. Conclusion: Our experiments demonstrate the sources of variability in radiomics pipelines (e.g., tumor subregion) can have a significant impact on the results, which may lead to superficial perfect performances that are irreproducible."
2208.00287,Simplex Clustering via sBeta with Applications to Online Adjustment of   Black-Box Predictions,"We explore clustering the softmax predictions of deep neural networks and introduce a novel probabilistic clustering method, referred to as k-sBetas. In the general context of clustering discrete distributions, the existing methods focused on exploring distortion measures tailored to simplex data, such as the KL divergence, as alternatives to the standard Euclidean distance. We provide a general maximum a posteriori (MAP) perspective of clustering distributions, emphasizing that the statistical models underlying the existing distortion-based methods may not be descriptive enough. Instead, we optimize a mixed-variable objective measuring data conformity within each cluster to the introduced sBeta density function, whose parameters are constrained and estimated jointly with binary assignment variables. Our versatile formulation approximates various parametric densities for modeling simplex data and enables the control of the cluster-balance bias. This yields highly competitive performances for the unsupervised adjustment of black-box model predictions in various scenarios. Our code and comparisons with the existing simplex-clustering approaches and our introduced softmax-prediction benchmarks are publicly available: https://github.com/fchiaroni/Clustering_Softmax_Predictions."
2208.00946,Motion-aware Memory Network for Fast Video Salient Object Detection,"Previous methods based on 3DCNN, convLSTM, or optical flow have achieved great success in video salient object detection (VSOD). However, they still suffer from high computational costs or poor quality of the generated saliency maps. To solve these problems, we design a space-time memory (STM)-based network, which extracts useful temporal information of the current frame from adjacent frames as the temporal branch of VSOD. Furthermore, previous methods only considered single-frame prediction without temporal association. As a result, the model may not focus on the temporal information sufficiently. Thus, we initially introduce object motion prediction between inter-frame into VSOD. Our model follows standard encoder--decoder architecture. In the encoding stage, we generate high-level temporal features by using high-level features from the current and its adjacent frames. This approach is more efficient than the optical flow-based methods. In the decoding stage, we propose an effective fusion strategy for spatial and temporal branches. The semantic information of the high-level features is used to fuse the object details in the low-level features, and then the spatiotemporal features are obtained step by step to reconstruct the saliency maps. Moreover, inspired by the boundary supervision commonly used in image salient object detection (ISOD), we design a motion-aware loss for predicting object boundary motion and simultaneously perform multitask learning for VSOD and object motion prediction, which can further facilitate the model to extract spatiotemporal features accurately and maintain the object integrity. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and can achieve state-of-the-art metrics on some datasets. The proposed model does not require optical flow or other preprocessing, and can reach a speed of nearly 100 FPS during inference."
2208.00963,FrOoDo: Framework for Out-of-Distribution Detection,"FrOoDo is an easy-to-use and flexible framework for Out-of-Distribution detection tasks in digital pathology. It can be used with PyTorch classification and segmentation models, and its modular design allows for easy extension. The goal is to automate the task of OoD Evaluation such that research can focus on the main goal of either designing new models, new methods or evaluating a new dataset. The code can be found at https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/FrOoDo."
2208.01587,Learning to Incorporate Texture Saliency Adaptive Attention to Image   Cartoonization,"Image cartoonization is recently dominated by generative adversarial networks (GANs) from the perspective of unsupervised image-to-image translation, in which an inherent challenge is to precisely capture and sufficiently transfer characteristic cartoon styles (e.g., clear edges, smooth color shading, abstract fine structures, etc.). Existing advanced models try to enhance cartoonization effect by learning to promote edges adversarially, introducing style transfer loss, or learning to align style from multiple representation space. This paper demonstrates that more distinct and vivid cartoonization effect could be easily achieved with only basic adversarial loss. Observing that cartoon style is more evident in cartoon-texture-salient local image regions, we build a region-level adversarial learning branch in parallel with the normal image-level one, which constrains adversarial learning on cartoon-texture-salient local patches for better perceiving and transferring cartoon texture features. To this end, a novel cartoon-texture-saliency-sampler (CTSS) module is proposed to dynamically sample cartoon-texture-salient patches from training data. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that texture saliency adaptive attention in adversarial learning, as a missing ingredient of related methods in image cartoonization, is of significant importance in facilitating and enhancing image cartoon stylization, especially for high-resolution input pictures."
2208.02313,Image-based Detection of Surface Defects in Concrete during Construction,"Defects increase the cost and duration of construction projects as they require significant inspection and documentation efforts. Automating defect detection could significantly reduce these efforts. This work focuses on detecting honeycombs, a substantial defect in concrete structures that may affect structural integrity. We compared honeycomb images scraped from the web with images obtained from real construction inspections. We found that web images do not capture the complete variance found in real-case scenarios and that there is still a lack of data in this domain. Our dataset is therefore freely available for further research. A Mask R-CNN and EfficientNet-B0 were trained for honeycomb detection. The Mask R-CNN model allows detecting honeycombs based on instance segmentation, whereas the EfficientNet-B0 model allows a patch-based classification. Our experiments demonstrate that both approaches are suitable for solving and automating honeycomb detection. In the future, this solution can be incorporated into defect documentation systems."
2208.02529,Metadata-enhanced contrastive learning from retinal optical coherence   tomography images,"Deep learning has potential to automate screening, monitoring and grading of disease in medical images. Pretraining with contrastive learning enables models to extract robust and generalisable features from natural image datasets, facilitating label-efficient downstream image analysis. However, the direct application of conventional contrastive methods to medical datasets introduces two domain-specific issues. Firstly, several image transformations which have been shown to be crucial for effective contrastive learning do not translate from the natural image to the medical image domain. Secondly, the assumption made by conventional methods, that any two images are dissimilar, is systematically misleading in medical datasets depicting the same anatomy and disease. This is exacerbated in longitudinal image datasets that repeatedly image the same patient cohort to monitor their disease progression over time. In this paper we tackle these issues by extending conventional contrastive frameworks with a novel metadata-enhanced strategy. Our approach employs widely available patient metadata to approximate the true set of inter-image contrastive relationships. To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position (i.e. left or right) and time series information. In experiments using two large longitudinal datasets containing 170,427 retinal OCT images of 7,912 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we evaluate the utility of using metadata to incorporate the temporal dynamics of disease progression into pretraining. Our metadata-enhanced approach outperforms both standard contrastive methods and a retinal image foundation model in five out of six image-level downstream tasks related to AMD. Due to its modularity, our method can be quickly and cost-effectively tested to establish the potential benefits of including available metadata in contrastive pretraining."
2208.02820,MOVE: Effective and Harmless Ownership Verification via Embedded   External Features,"Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely adopted in different applications. Despite its commercial values, training a well-performing DNN is resource-consuming. Accordingly, the well-trained model is valuable intellectual property for its owner. However, recent studies revealed the threats of model stealing, where the adversaries can obtain a function-similar copy of the victim model, even when they can only query the model. In this paper, we propose an effective and harmless model ownership verification (MOVE) to defend against different types of model stealing simultaneously, without introducing new security risks. In general, we conduct the ownership verification by verifying whether a suspicious model contains the knowledge of defender-specified external features. Specifically, we embed the external features by modifying a few training samples with style transfer. We then train a meta-classifier to determine whether a model is stolen from the victim. This approach is inspired by the understanding that the stolen models should contain the knowledge of features learned by the victim model. In particular, \revision{we develop our MOVE method under both white-box and black-box settings and analyze its theoretical foundation to provide comprehensive model protection.} Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. The codes for reproducing the main experiments of our method are available at https://github.com/THUYimingLi/MOVE."
2208.02881,Improving Fuzzy-Logic based Map-Matching Method with Trajectory   Stay-Point Detection,"The requirement to trace and process moving objects in the contemporary era gradually increases since numerous applications quickly demand precise moving object locations. The Map-matching method is employed as a preprocessing technique, which matches a moving object point on a corresponding road. However, most of the GPS trajectory datasets include stay-points irregularity, which makes map-matching algorithms mismatch trajectories to irrelevant streets. Therefore, determining the stay-point region in GPS trajectory datasets results in better accurate matching and more rapid approaches. In this work, we cluster stay-points in a trajectory dataset with DBSCAN and eliminate redundant data to improve the efficiency of the map-matching algorithm by lowering processing time. We reckoned our proposed method's performance and exactness with a ground truth dataset compared to a fuzzy-logic based map-matching algorithm. Fortunately, our approach yields 27.39% data size reduction and 8.9% processing time reduction with the same accurate results as the previous fuzzy-logic based map-matching approach."
2208.03486,HaloAE: An HaloNet based Local Transformer Auto-Encoder for Anomaly   Detection and Localization,"Unsupervised anomaly detection and localization is a crucial task as it is impossible to collect and label all possible anomalies. Many studies have emphasized the importance of integrating local and global information to achieve accurate segmentation of anomalies. To this end, there has been a growing interest in Transformer, which allows modeling long-range content interactions. However, global interactions through self attention are generally too expensive for most image scales. In this study, we introduce HaloAE, the first auto-encoder based on a local 2D version of Transformer with HaloNet. With HaloAE, we have created a hybrid model that combines convolution and local 2D block-wise self-attention layers and jointly performs anomaly detection and segmentation through a single model. We achieved competitive results on the MVTec dataset, suggesting that vision models incorporating Transformer could benefit from a local computation of the self-attention operation, and pave the way for other applications."
2208.03561,Study of detecting behavioral signatures within DeepFake videos,"There is strong interest in the generation of synthetic video imagery of people talking for various purposes, including entertainment, communication, training, and advertisement. With the development of deep fake generation models, synthetic video imagery will soon be visually indistinguishable to the naked eye from a naturally capture video. In addition, many methods are continuing to improve to avoid more careful, forensic visual analysis. Some deep fake videos are produced through the use of facial puppetry, which directly controls the head and face of the synthetic image through the movements of the actor, allow the actor to 'puppet' the image of another. In this paper, we address the question of whether one person's movements can be distinguished from the original speaker by controlling the visual appearance of the speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We conduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a different person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same person speaking a different utterance, and 3) originates from a different person speaking the same utterance. Our study shows that synthetic videos in all three cases are seen as less real and less engaging than the original source video. Our results indicate that there could be a behavioral signature that is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual appearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a deep fake from a properly captured video."
2208.03571,Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object   tracking,"Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot."
2208.03754,Exploring Long- and Short-Range Temporal Information for Learned Video   Compression,"Learned video compression methods have gained a variety of interest in the video coding community since they have matched or even exceeded the rate-distortion (RD) performance of traditional video codecs. However, many current learning-based methods are dedicated to utilizing short-range temporal information, thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we focus on exploiting the unique characteristics of video content and further exploring temporal information to enhance compression performance. Specifically, for long-range temporal information exploitation, we propose temporal prior that can update continuously within the group of pictures (GOP) during inference. In that case temporal prior contains valuable temporal information of all decoded images within the current GOP. As for short-range temporal information, we propose a progressive guided motion compensation to achieve robust and effective compensation. In detail, we design a hierarchical structure to achieve multi-scale compensation. More importantly, we use optical flow guidance to generate pixel offsets between feature maps at each scale, and the compensation results at each scale will be used to guide the following scale's compensation. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better RD performance than state-of-the-art video compression approaches. The code is publicly available on: https://github.com/Huairui/LSTVC."
2208.03819,Cross-Skeleton Interaction Graph Aggregation Network for Representation   Learning of Mouse Social Behaviour,"Automated social behaviour analysis of mice has become an increasingly popular research area in behavioural neuroscience. Recently, pose information (i.e., locations of keypoints or skeleton) has been used to interpret social behaviours of mice. Nevertheless, effective encoding and decoding of social interaction information underlying the keypoints of mice has been rarely investigated in the existing methods. In particular, it is challenging to model complex social interactions between mice due to highly deformable body shapes and ambiguous movement patterns. To deal with the interaction modelling problem, we here propose a Cross-Skeleton Interaction Graph Aggregation Network (CS-IGANet) to learn abundant dynamics of freely interacting mice, where a Cross-Skeleton Node-level Interaction module (CS-NLI) is used to model multi-level interactions (i.e., intra-, inter- and cross-skeleton interactions). Furthermore, we design a novel Interaction-Aware Transformer (IAT) to dynamically learn the graph-level representation of social behaviours and update the node-level representation, guided by our proposed interaction-aware self-attention mechanism. Finally, to enhance the representation ability of our model, an auxiliary self-supervised learning task is proposed for measuring the similarity between cross-skeleton nodes. Experimental results on the standard CRMI13-Skeleton and our PDMB-Skeleton datasets show that our proposed model outperforms several other state-of-the-art approaches."
2208.03923,Adversarial robustness of VAEs through the lens of local geometry,"In an unsupervised attack on variational autoencoders (VAEs), an adversary finds a small perturbation in an input sample that significantly changes its latent space encoding, thereby compromising the reconstruction for a fixed decoder. A known reason for such vulnerability is the distortions in the latent space resulting from a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a prior distribution. Consequently, a slight change in an input sample can move its encoding to a low/zero density region in the latent space resulting in an unconstrained generation. This paper demonstrates that an optimal way for an adversary to attack VAEs is to exploit a directional bias of a stochastic pullback metric tensor induced by the encoder and decoder networks. The pullback metric tensor of an encoder measures the change in infinitesimal latent volume from an input to a latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens to analyse the effect of input perturbations leading to latent space distortions. We propose robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of a pullback metric tensor. Moreover, we empirically show that the scores correlate with the robustness parameter $\beta$ of the $\beta-$VAE. Since increasing $\beta$ also degrades reconstruction quality, we demonstrate a simple alternative using \textit{mixup} training to fill the empty regions in the latent space, thus improving robustness with improved reconstruction."
2208.03974,Aerial Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Drones equipped with cameras can significantly enhance human ability to perceive the world because of their remarkable maneuverability in 3D space. Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the BEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, generated by the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real, collected by DJI Matrice 300 RTK, in both datasets, high-quality annotations for 3D object detection are provided. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset benefits real-world performance, and iii) DVDET also benefits monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we will release the dataset and related code in https://github.com/PhyllisH/DVDET."
2208.04206,Vision-Based Activity Recognition in Children with Autism-Related   Behaviors,"Advances in machine learning and contactless sensors have enabled the understanding complex human behaviors in a healthcare setting. In particular, several deep learning systems have been introduced to enable comprehensive analysis of neuro-developmental conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This condition affects children from their early developmental stages onwards, and diagnosis relies entirely on observing the child's behavior and detecting behavioral cues. However, the diagnosis process is time-consuming as it requires long-term behavior observation, and the scarce availability of specialists. We demonstrate the effect of a region-based computer vision system to help clinicians and parents analyze a child's behavior. For this purpose, we adopt and enhance a dataset for analyzing autism-related actions using videos of children captured in uncontrolled environments (e.g. videos collected with consumer-grade cameras, in varied environments). The data is pre-processed by detecting the target child in the video to reduce the impact of background noise. Motivated by the effectiveness of temporal convolutional models, we propose both light-weight and conventional models capable of extracting action features from video frames and classifying autism-related behaviors by analyzing the relationships between frames in a video. Through extensive evaluations on the feature extraction and learning strategies, we demonstrate that the best performance is achieved with an Inflated 3D Convnet and Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Networks, achieving a 0.83 Weighted F1-score for classification of the three autism-related actions, outperforming existing methods. We also propose a light-weight solution by employing the ESNet backbone within the same system, achieving competitive results of 0.71 Weighted F1-score, and enabling potential deployment on embedded systems."
2208.04378,Contrast-Phys: Unsupervised Video-based Remote Physiological Measurement   via Spatiotemporal Contrast,"Video-based remote physiological measurement utilizes face videos to measure the blood volume change signal, which is also called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). Supervised methods for rPPG measurements achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, supervised rPPG methods require face videos and ground truth physiological signals for model training. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised rPPG measurement method that does not require ground truth signals for training. We use a 3DCNN model to generate multiple rPPG signals from each video in different spatiotemporal locations and train the model with a contrastive loss where rPPG signals from the same video are pulled together while those from different videos are pushed away. We test on five public datasets, including RGB videos and NIR videos. The results show that our method outperforms the previous unsupervised baseline and achieves accuracies very close to the current best supervised rPPG methods on all five datasets. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our approach can run at a much faster speed and is more robust to noises than the previous unsupervised baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhaodongsun/contrast-phys."
2208.04448,NeuralVDB: High-resolution Sparse Volume Representation using   Hierarchical Neural Networks,"We introduce NeuralVDB, which improves on an existing industry standard for efficient storage of sparse volumetric data, denoted VDB [Museth 2013], by leveraging recent advancements in machine learning. Our novel hybrid data structure can reduce the memory footprints of VDB volumes by orders of magnitude, while maintaining its flexibility and only incurring small (user-controlled) compression errors. Specifically, NeuralVDB replaces the lower nodes of a shallow and wide VDB tree structure with multiple hierarchical neural networks that separately encode topology and value information by means of neural classifiers and regressors respectively. This approach is proven to maximize the compression ratio while maintaining the spatial adaptivity offered by the higher-level VDB data structure. For sparse signed distance fields and density volumes, we have observed compression ratios on the order of 10x to more than 100x from already compressed VDB inputs, with little to no visual artifacts. Furthermore, NeuralVDB is shown to offer more effective compression performance compared to other neural representations such as Neural Geometric Level of Detail [Takikawa et al. 2021], Variable Bitrate Neural Fields [Takikawa et al. 2022a], and Instant Neural Graphics Primitives [M\""uller et al. 2022]. Finally, we demonstrate how warm-starting from previous frames can accelerate training, i.e., compression, of animated volumes as well as improve temporal coherency of model inference, i.e., decompression."
2208.04464,In the Eye of Transformer: Global-Local Correlation for Egocentric Gaze   Estimation,"In this paper, we present the first transformer-based model to address the challenging problem of egocentric gaze estimation. We observe that the connection between the global scene context and local visual information is vital for localizing the gaze fixation from egocentric video frames. To this end, we design the transformer encoder to embed the global context as one additional visual token and further propose a novel Global-Local Correlation (GLC) module to explicitly model the correlation of the global token and each local token. We validate our model on two egocentric video datasets - EGTEA Gaze+ and Ego4D. Our detailed ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of our method. In addition, our approach exceeds previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin. We also provide additional visualizations to support our claim that global-local correlation serves a key representation for predicting gaze fixation from egocentric videos. More details can be found in our website (https://bolinlai.github.io/GLC-EgoGazeEst)."
2208.04525,Using Large Context for Kidney Multi-Structure Segmentation from CTA   Images,"Accurate and automated segmentation of multi-structure (i.e., kidneys, renal tu-mors, arteries, and veins) from 3D CTA is one of the most important tasks for surgery-based renal cancer treatment (e.g., laparoscopic partial nephrectomy). This paper briefly presents the main technique details of the multi-structure seg-mentation method in MICCAI 2022 KIPA challenge. The main contribution of this paper is that we design the 3D UNet with the large context information cap-turing capability. Our method ranked eighth on the MICCAI 2022 KIPA chal-lenge open testing dataset with a mean position of 8.2. Our code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/fengjiejiejiejie/kipa22_nnunet."
2208.05369,E Pluribus Unum Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks,"The adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in high-stake domains is hindered by their inability to meet society's demand for transparency in decision-making. So far, a growing number of methodologies have emerged for developing CNN models that are interpretable by design. However, such models are not capable of providing interpretations in accordance with human perception, while maintaining competent performance. In this paper, we tackle these challenges with a novel, general framework for instantiating inherently interpretable CNN models, named E Pluribus Unum Interpretable CNN (EPU-CNN). An EPU-CNN model consists of CNN sub-networks, each of which receives a different representation of an input image expressing a perceptual feature, such as color or texture. The output of an EPU-CNN model consists of the classification prediction and its interpretation, in terms of relative contributions of perceptual features in different regions of the input image. EPU-CNN models have been extensively evaluated on various publicly available datasets, as well as a contributed benchmark dataset. Medical datasets are used to demonstrate the applicability of EPU-CNN for risk-sensitive decisions in medicine. The experimental results indicate that EPU-CNN models can achieve a comparable or better classification performance than other CNN architectures while providing humanly perceivable interpretations."
2208.05401,Benchmarking Joint Face Spoofing and Forgery Detection with Visual and   Physiological Cues,"Face anti-spoofing (FAS) and face forgery detection play vital roles in securing face biometric systems from presentation attacks (PAs) and vicious digital manipulation (e.g., deepfakes). Despite promising performance upon large-scale data and powerful deep models, the generalization problem of existing approaches is still an open issue. Most of recent approaches focus on 1) unimodal visual appearance or physiological (i.e., remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)) cues; and 2) separated feature representation for FAS or face forgery detection. On one side, unimodal appearance and rPPG features are respectively vulnerable to high-fidelity face 3D mask and video replay attacks, inspiring us to design reliable multi-modal fusion mechanisms for generalized face attack detection. On the other side, there are rich common features across FAS and face forgery detection tasks (e.g., periodic rPPG rhythms and vanilla appearance for bonafides), providing solid evidence to design a joint FAS and face forgery detection system in a multi-task learning fashion. In this paper, we establish the first joint face spoofing and forgery detection benchmark using both visual appearance and physiological rPPG cues. To enhance the rPPG periodicity discrimination, we design a two-branch physiological network using both facial spatio-temporal rPPG signal map and its continuous wavelet transformed counterpart as inputs. To mitigate the modality bias and improve the fusion efficacy, we conduct a weighted batch and layer normalization for both appearance and rPPG features before multi-modal fusion. We find that the generalization capacities of both unimodal (appearance or rPPG) and multi-modal (appearance+rPPG) models can be obviously improved via joint training on these two tasks. We hope this new benchmark will facilitate the future research of both FAS and deepfake detection communities."
2208.05481,High-Frequency Space Diffusion Models for Accelerated MRI,"Diffusion models with continuous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have shown superior performances in image generation. It can serve as a deep generative prior to solving the inverse problem in magnetic resonance (MR) reconstruction. However, low-frequency regions of $k$-space data are typically fully sampled in fast MR imaging, while existing diffusion models are performed throughout the entire image or $k$-space, inevitably introducing uncertainty in the reconstruction of low-frequency regions. Additionally, existing diffusion models often demand substantial iterations to converge, resulting in time-consuming reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SDE tailored specifically for MR reconstruction with the diffusion process in high-frequency space (referred to as HFS-SDE). This approach ensures determinism in the fully sampled low-frequency regions and accelerates the sampling procedure of reverse diffusion. Experiments conducted on the publicly available fastMRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed HFS-SDE method outperforms traditional parallel imaging methods, supervised deep learning, and existing diffusion models in terms of reconstruction accuracy and stability. The fast convergence properties are also confirmed through theoretical and experimental validation. Our code and weights are available at https://github.com/Aboriginer/HFS-SDE."
2208.05617,Language-Guided Face Animation by Recurrent StyleGAN-based Generator,"Recent works on language-guided image manipulation have shown great power of language in providing rich semantics, especially for face images. However, the other natural information, motions, in language is less explored. In this paper, we leverage the motion information and study a novel task, language-guided face animation, that aims to animate a static face image with the help of languages. To better utilize both semantics and motions from languages, we propose a simple yet effective framework. Specifically, we propose a recurrent motion generator to extract a series of semantic and motion information from the language and feed it along with visual information to a pre-trained StyleGAN to generate high-quality frames. To optimize the proposed framework, three carefully designed loss functions are proposed including a regularization loss to keep the face identity, a path length regularization loss to ensure motion smoothness, and a contrastive loss to enable video synthesis with various language guidance in one single model. Extensive experiments with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on diverse domains (\textit{e.g.,} human face, anime face, and dog face) demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating high-quality and realistic videos from one still image with the guidance of language. Code will be available at https://github.com/TiankaiHang/language-guided-animation.git."
2208.05788,Semantic Self-adaptation: Enhancing Generalization with a Single Sample,"The lack of out-of-domain generalization is a critical weakness of deep networks for semantic segmentation. Previous studies relied on the assumption of a static model, i. e., once the training process is complete, model parameters remain fixed at test time. In this work, we challenge this premise with a self-adaptive approach for semantic segmentation that adjusts the inference process to each input sample. Self-adaptation operates on two levels. First, it fine-tunes the parameters of convolutional layers to the input image using consistency regularization. Second, in Batch Normalization layers, self-adaptation interpolates between the training and the reference distribution derived from a single test sample. Despite both techniques being well known in the literature, their combination sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic-to-real generalization benchmarks. Our empirical study suggests that self-adaptation may complement the established practice of model regularization at training time for improving deep network generalization to out-of-domain data. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/visinf/self-adaptive."
2208.05845,Analyzing Fairness in Deepfake Detection With Massively Annotated   Databases,"In recent years, image and video manipulations with Deepfake have become a severe concern for security and society. Many detection models and datasets have been proposed to detect Deepfake data reliably. However, there is an increased concern that these models and training databases might be biased and, thus, cause Deepfake detectors to fail. In this work, we investigate factors causing biased detection in public Deepfake datasets by (a) creating large-scale demographic and non-demographic attribute annotations with 47 different attributes for five popular Deepfake datasets and (b) comprehensively analysing attributes resulting in AI-bias of three state-of-the-art Deepfake detection backbone models on these datasets. The analysis shows how various attributes influence a large variety of distinctive attributes (from over 65M labels) on the detection performance which includes demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and non-demographic (hair, skin, accessories, etc.) attributes. The results examined datasets show limited diversity and, more importantly, show that the utilised Deepfake detection backbone models are strongly affected by investigated attributes making them not fair across attributes. The Deepfake detection backbone methods trained on such imbalanced/biased datasets result in incorrect detection results leading to generalisability, fairness, and security issues. Our findings and annotated datasets will guide future research to evaluate and mitigate bias in Deepfake detection techniques. The annotated datasets and the corresponding code are publicly available."
2208.05853,MultiMatch: Multi-task Learning for Semi-supervised Domain   Generalization,"Domain generalization (DG) aims at learning a model on source domains to well generalize on the unseen target domain. Although it has achieved great success, most of existing methods require the label information for all training samples in source domains, which is time-consuming and expensive in the real-world application. In this paper, we resort to solving the semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) task, where there are a few label information in each source domain. To address the task, we first analyze the theory of the multi-domain learning, which highlights that 1) mitigating the impact of domain gap and 2) exploiting all samples to train the model can effectively reduce the generalization error in each source domain so as to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. According to the analysis, we propose MultiMatch, i.e., extending FixMatch to the multi-task learning framework, producing the high-quality pseudo-label for SSDG. To be specific, we consider each training domain as a single task (i.e., local task) and combine all training domains together (i.e., global task) to train an extra task for the unseen test domain. In the multi-task framework, we utilize the independent BN and classifier for each task, which can effectively alleviate the interference from different domains during pseudo-labeling. Also, most of parameters in the framework are shared, which can be trained by all training samples sufficiently. Moreover, to further boost the pseudo-label accuracy and the model's generalization, we fuse the predictions from the global task and local task during training and testing, respectively. A series of experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and it outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods and the SSDG method on several benchmark DG datasets."
2208.06087,Domain-invariant Prototypes for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep Learning has greatly advanced the performance of semantic segmentation, however, its success relies on the availability of large amounts of annotated data for training. Hence, many efforts have been devoted to domain adaptive semantic segmentation that focuses on transferring semantic knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training methods typically require multiple rounds of training, while another popular framework based on adversarial training is known to be sensitive to hyper-parameters. In this paper, we present an easy-to-train framework that learns domain-invariant prototypes for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. In particular, we show that domain adaptation shares a common character with few-shot learning in that both aim to recognize some types of unseen data with knowledge learned from large amounts of seen data. Thus, we propose a unified framework for domain adaptation and few-shot learning. The core idea is to use the class prototypes extracted from few-shot annotated target images to classify pixels of both source images and target images. Our method involves only one-stage training and does not need to be trained on large-scale un-annotated target images. Moreover, our method can be extended to variants of both domain adaptation and few-shot learning. Experiments on adapting GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes show that our method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art."
2208.06222,Scale-free and Task-agnostic Attack: Generating Photo-realistic   Adversarial Patterns with Patch Quilting Generator,"\noindent Traditional L_p norm-restricted image attack algorithms suffer from poor transferability to black box scenarios and poor robustness to defense algorithms. Recent CNN generator-based attack approaches can synthesize unrestricted and semantically meaningful entities to the image, which is shown to be transferable and robust. However, such methods attack images by either synthesizing local adversarial entities, which are only suitable for attacking specific contents or performing global attacks, which are only applicable to a specific image scale. In this paper, we propose a novel Patch Quilting Generative Adversarial Networks (PQ-GAN) to learn the first scale-free CNN generator that can be applied to attack images with arbitrary scales for various computer vision tasks. The principal investigation on transferability of the generated adversarial examples, robustness to defense frameworks, and visual quality assessment show that the proposed PQG-based attack framework outperforms the other nine state-of-the-art adversarial attack approaches when attacking the neural networks trained on two standard evaluation datasets (i.e., ImageNet and CityScapes)."
2208.06233,Dynamic Sensor Matching based on Geomagnetic Inertial Navigation,"Optical sensors can capture dynamic environments and derive depth information in near real-time. The quality of these digital reconstructions is determined by factors like illumination, surface and texture conditions, sensing speed and other sensor characteristics as well as the sensor-object relations. Improvements can be obtained by using dynamically collected data from multiple sensors. However, matching the data from multiple sensors requires a shared world coordinate system. We present a concept for transferring multi-sensor data into a commonly referenced world coordinate system: the earth's magnetic field. The steady presence of our planetary magnetic field provides a reliable world coordinate system, which can serve as a reference for a position-defined reconstruction of dynamic environments. Our approach is evaluated using magnetic field sensors of the ZED 2 stereo camera from Stereolabs, which provides orientation relative to the North Pole similar to a compass. With the help of inertial measurement unit informations, each camera's position data can be transferred into the unified world coordinate system. Our evaluation reveals the level of quality possible using the earth magnetic field and allows a basis for dynamic and real-time-based applications of optical multi-sensors for environment detection."
2208.06449,When CNN Meet with ViT: Towards Semi-Supervised Learning for Multi-Class   Medical Image Semantic Segmentation,"Due to the lack of quality annotation in medical imaging community, semi-supervised learning methods are highly valued in image semantic segmentation tasks. In this paper, an advanced consistency-aware pseudo-label-based self-ensembling approach is presented to fully utilize the power of Vision Transformer(ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in semi-supervised learning. Our proposed framework consists of a feature-learning module which is enhanced by ViT and CNN mutually, and a guidance module which is robust for consistency-aware purposes. The pseudo labels are inferred and utilized recurrently and separately by views of CNN and ViT in the feature-learning module to expand the data set and are beneficial to each other. Meanwhile, a perturbation scheme is designed for the feature-learning module, and averaging network weight is utilized to develop the guidance module. By doing so, the framework combines the feature-learning strength of CNN and ViT, strengthens the performance via dual-view co-training, and enables consistency-aware supervision in a semi-supervised manner. A topological exploration of all alternative supervision modes with CNN and ViT are detailed validated, demonstrating the most promising performance and specific setting of our method on semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark data set with a variety of metrics. The code is publicly available."
2208.06538,Transferable Adversarial Examples with Bayes Approach,"The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to black-box adversarial attacks is one of the most heated topics in trustworthy AI. In such attacks, the attackers operate without any insider knowledge of the model, making the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples critical. Despite the potential for adversarial examples to be effective across various models, it has been observed that adversarial examples that are specifically crafted for a specific model often exhibit poor transferability. In this paper, we explore the transferability of adversarial examples via the lens of Bayesian approach. Specifically, we leverage Bayesian approach to probe the transferability and then study what constitutes a transferability-promoting prior. Following this, we design two concrete transferability-promoting priors, along with an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for instances sampled from these priors. Employing these techniques, we present BayAtk. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant effectiveness of BayAtk in crafting more transferable adversarial examples against both undefended and defended black-box models compared to existing state-of-the-art attacks."
2208.06551,Exploiting Multiple Sequence Lengths in Fast End to End Training for   Image Captioning,"We introduce a method called the Expansion mechanism that processes the input unconstrained by the number of elements in the sequence. By doing so, the model can learn more effectively compared to traditional attention-based approaches. To support this claim, we design a novel architecture ExpansionNet v2 that achieved strong results on the MS COCO 2014 Image Captioning challenge and the State of the Art in its respective category, with a score of 143.7 CIDErD in the offline test split, 140.8 CIDErD in the online evaluation server and 72.9 AllCIDEr on the nocaps validation set.

2208.06561,Drone Referring Localization: An Efficient Heterogeneous Spatial Feature   Interaction Method For UAV Self-Localization,"Image retrieval (IR) has emerged as a promising approach for self-localization in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, IR-based methods face several challenges: 1) Pre- and post-processing incur significant computational and storage overhead; 2) The lack of interaction between dual-source features impairs precise spatial perception. In this paper, we propose an efficient heterogeneous spatial feature interaction method, termed Drone Referring Localization (DRL), which aims to localize UAV-view images within satellite imagery. Unlike conventional methods that treat different data sources in isolation, followed by cosine similarity computations, DRL facilitates the learnable interaction of heterogeneous features. To implement the proposed DRL, we design two transformer-based frameworks, Post-Fusion and Mix-Fusion, enabling end-to-end training and inference. Furthermore, we introduce random scale cropping and weight balance loss techniques to augment paired data and optimize the balance between positive and negative sample weights. Additionally, we construct a new dataset, UL14, and establish a benchmark tailored to the DRL framework. Compared to traditional IR methods, DRL achieves superior localization accuracy (MA@20 +9.4\%) while significantly reducing computational time (1/7) and storage overhead (1/3). The dataset and code will be made publicly available. The dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DRL} ."
2208.07174,A Human-in-the-Middle Attack against Object Detection Systems,"Object detection systems using deep learning models have become increasingly popular in robotics thanks to the rising power of CPUs and GPUs in embedded systems. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. While some attacks are limited by strict assumptions on access to the detection system, we propose a novel hardware attack inspired by Man-in-the-Middle attacks in cryptography. This attack generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) and injects the perturbation between the USB camera and the detection system via a hardware attack. Besides, prior research is misled by an evaluation metric that measures the model accuracy rather than the attack performance. In combination with our proposed evaluation metrics, we significantly increased the strength of adversarial perturbations. These findings raise serious concerns for applications of deep learning models in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous driving."
2208.07407,SemAug: Semantically Meaningful Image Augmentations for Object Detection Through Language Grounding,"Data augmentation is an essential technique in improving the generalization of deep neural networks. The majority of existing image-domain augmentations either rely on geometric and structural transformations, or apply different kinds of photometric distortions. In this paper, we propose an effective technique for image augmentation by injecting contextually meaningful knowledge into the scenes. Our method of semantically meaningful image augmentation for object detection via language grounding, SemAug, starts by calculating semantically appropriate new objects that can be placed into relevant locations in the image (the what and where problems). Then it embeds these objects into their relevant target locations, thereby promoting diversity of object instance distribution. Our method allows for introducing new object instances and categories that may not even exist in the training set. Furthermore, it does not require the additional overhead of training a context network, so it can be easily added to existing architectures. Our comprehensive set of evaluations showed that the proposed method is very effective in improving the generalization, while the overhead is negligible. In particular, for a wide range of model architectures, our method achieved ~2-4% and ~1-2% mAP improvements for the task of object detection on the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets, respectively."
2208.07463,Conv-Adapter: Exploring Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning for   ConvNets,"While parameter efficient tuning (PET) methods have shown great potential with transformer architecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness with large-scale ConvNets is still under-studied on Computer Vision (CV) tasks. This paper proposes Conv-Adapter, a PET module designed for ConvNets. Conv-Adapter is light-weight, domain-transferable, and architecture-agnostic with generalized performance on different tasks. When transferring on downstream tasks, Conv-Adapter learns tasks-specific feature modulation to the intermediate representations of backbones while keeping the pre-trained parameters frozen. By introducing only a tiny amount of learnable parameters, e.g., only 3.5% full fine-tuning parameters of ResNet50. It can also be applied for transformer-based backbones. Conv-Adapter outperforms previous PET baseline methods and achieves comparable or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning on 23 classification tasks of various domains. It also presents superior performance on the few-shot classification with an average margin of 3.39%. Beyond classification, Conv-Adapter can generalize to detection and segmentation tasks with more than 50% reduction of parameters but comparable performance to the traditional full fine-tuning."
2208.07552,Coil2Coil: Self-supervised MR image denoising using phased-array coil images,"Denoising of magnetic resonance images is beneficial in improving the quality of low signal-to-noise ratio images. Recently, denoising using deep neural networks has demonstrated promising results. Most of these networks, however, utilize supervised learning, which requires large training images of noise-corrupted and clean image pairs. Obtaining training images, particularly clean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as Noise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been developed to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study, we propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does not require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images for training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array coils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel coil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they are processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such that they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method inputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application of the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the best performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable outcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully denoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error maps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans for clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various clinical applications."
2208.07585,Neural network fragile watermarking with no model performance   degradation,"Deep neural networks are vulnerable to malicious fine-tuning attacks such as data poisoning and backdoor attacks. Therefore, in recent research, it is proposed how to detect malicious fine-tuning of neural network models. However, it usually negatively affects the performance of the protected model. Thus, we propose a novel neural network fragile watermarking with no model performance degradation. In the process of watermarking, we train a generative model with the specific loss function and secret key to generate triggers that are sensitive to the fine-tuning of the target classifier. In the process of verifying, we adopt the watermarked classifier to get labels of each fragile trigger. Then, malicious fine-tuning can be detected by comparing secret keys and labels. Experiments on classic datasets and classifiers show that the proposed method can effectively detect model malicious fine-tuning with no model performance degradation."
2208.07655,A Hybrid Deep Feature-Based Deformable Image Registration Method for   Pathology Images,"Pathologists need to combine information from differently stained pathology slices for accurate diagnosis. Deformable image registration is a necessary technique for fusing multi-modal pathology slices. This paper proposes a hybrid deep feature-based deformable image registration framework for stained pathology samples. We first extract dense feature points via the detector-based and detector-free deep learning feature networks and perform points matching. Then, to further reduce false matches, an outlier detection method combining the isolation forest statistical model and the local affine correction model is proposed. Finally, the interpolation method generates the deformable vector field for pathology image registration based on the above matching points. We evaluate our method on the dataset of the Non-rigid Histology Image Registration (ANHIR) challenge, which is co-organized with the IEEE ISBI 2019 conference. Our technique outperforms the traditional approaches by 17% with the Average-Average registration target error (rTRE) reaching 0.0034. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance and ranked 1st in evaluating the test dataset. The proposed hybrid deep feature-based registration method can potentially become a reliable method for pathology image registration."
2208.07853,Estimating Appearance Models for Image Segmentation via Tensor   Factorization,"Image Segmentation is one of the core tasks in Computer Vision and solving it often depends on modeling the image appearance data via the color distributions of each it its constituent regions. Whereas many segmentation algorithms handle the appearance models dependence using alternation or implicit methods, we propose here a new approach to directly estimate them from the image without prior information on the underlying segmentation. Our method uses local high order color statistics from the image as an input to tensor factorization-based estimator for latent variable models. This approach is able to estimate models in multiregion images and automatically output the regions proportions without prior user interaction, overcoming the drawbacks from a prior attempt to this problem. We also demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in many challenging synthetic and real imaging scenarios and show that it leads to an efficient segmentation algorithm."
2208.08076,Significance of Skeleton-based Features in Virtual Try-On,"The idea of \textit{Virtual Try-ON} (VTON) benefits e-retailing by giving an user the convenience of trying a clothing at the comfort of their home. In general, most of the existing VTON methods produce inconsistent results when a person posing with his arms folded i.e., bent or crossed, wants to try an outfit. The problem becomes severe in the case of long-sleeved outfits. As then, for crossed arm postures, overlap among different clothing parts might happen. The existing approaches, especially the warping-based methods employing \textit{Thin Plate Spline (TPS)} transform can not tackle such cases. To this end, we attempt a solution approach where the clothing from the source person is segmented into semantically meaningful parts and each part is warped independently to the shape of the person. To address the bending issue, we employ hand-crafted geometric features consistent with human body geometry for warping the source outfit. In addition, we propose two learning-based modules: a synthesizer network and a mask prediction network. All these together attempt to produce a photo-realistic, pose-robust VTON solution without requiring any paired training data. Comparison with some of the benchmark methods clearly establishes the effectiveness of the approach."
2208.08161,KAM -- a Kernel Attention Module for Emotion Classification with EEG   Data,"In this work, a kernel attention module is presented for the task of EEG-based emotion classification with neural networks. The proposed module utilizes a self-attention mechanism by performing a kernel trick, demanding significantly fewer trainable parameters and computations than standard attention modules. The design also provides a scalar for quantitatively examining the amount of attention assigned during deep feature refinement, hence help better interpret a trained model. Using EEGNet as the backbone model, extensive experiments are conducted on the SEED dataset to assess the module's performance on within-subject classification tasks compared to other SOTA attention modules. Requiring only one extra parameter, the inserted module is shown to boost the base model's mean prediction accuracy up to more than 1\% across 15 subjects. A key component of the method is the interpretability of solutions, which is addressed using several different techniques, and is included throughout as part of the dependency analysis."
2208.08270,On the Privacy Effect of Data Enhancement via the Lens of Memorization,"Machine learning poses severe privacy concerns as it has been shown that the learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many works have investigated the effect of widely adopted data augmentation and adversarial training techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem, we deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization degrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several findings about the connections between three essential properties of machine learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are less correlated than those of the previous results. Moreover, there is not necessarily a trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy as stronger adversarial robustness does not make the model more susceptible to privacy attacks."
2208.08624,Domain Camera Adaptation and Collaborative Multiple Feature Clustering   for Unsupervised Person Re-ID,"Recently unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn much attention due to its open-world scenario settings where limited annotated data is available. Existing supervised methods often fail to generalize well on unseen domains, while the unsupervised methods, mostly lack multi-granularity information and are prone to suffer from confirmation bias. In this paper, we aim at finding better feature representations on the unseen target domain from two aspects, 1) performing unsupervised domain adaptation on the labeled source domain and 2) mining potential similarities on the unlabeled target domain. Besides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate the influence of confirmation bias. Firstly, a generative adversarial network is utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain. Moreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel collaborative multiple feature clustering framework (CMFC) to learn the internal data structure of target domain, including global feature and partial feature branches. The global feature branch (GB) employs unsupervised clustering on the global feature of person images while the Partial feature branch (PB) mines similarities within different body regions. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show the competitive performance of our method under unsupervised person re-ID settings."
2208.08672,RRWaveNet: A Compact End-to-End Multi-Scale Residual CNN for Robust PPG   Respiratory Rate Estimation,"Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect severe medical events such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders. Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four datasets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 seconds). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at optimal window size of 1.66 \pm 1.01, 1.59 \pm 1.08, 1.92 \pm 0.96 and 1.23 \pm 0.61 breaths per minute for each dataset. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI datasets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU datasets as pretraining datasets, reducing the MAE by up to 21$\%$. This shows that this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the context of telemedicine and at home."
2208.08780,GraVoS: Voxel Selection for 3D Point-Cloud Detection,"3D object detection within large 3D scenes is challenging not only due to the sparsity and irregularity of 3D point clouds, but also due to both the extreme foreground-background scene imbalance and class imbalance. A common approach is to add ground-truth objects from other scenes. Differently, we propose to modify the scenes by removing elements (voxels), rather than adding ones. Our approach selects the ""meaningful"" voxels, in a manner that addresses both types of dataset imbalance. The approach is general and can be applied to any voxel-based detector, yet the meaningfulness of a voxel is network-dependent. Our voxel selection is shown to improve the performance of several prominent 3D detection methods."
2208.09315,Self-Supervised Place Recognition by Refining Temporal and Featural   Pseudo Labels from Panoramic Data,"Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR. Our code and datasets can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/TF-VPR/"
2208.09345,IPNET:Influential Prototypical Networks for Few Shot Learning,"Prototypical network (PN) is a simple yet effective few shot learning strategy. It is a metric-based meta-learning technique where classification is performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototypical representations of each class. Conventional PN attributes equal importance to all samples and generates prototypes by simply averaging the support sample embeddings belonging to each class. In this work, we propose a novel version of PN that attributes weights to support samples corresponding to their influence on the support sample distribution. Influence weights of samples are calculated based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the mean embeddings of sample distributions including and excluding the sample. Further, the influence factor of a sample is measured using MMD based on the shift in the distribution in the absence of that sample."
2208.09424,Hierarchical Compositional Representations for Few-shot Action   Recognition,"Recently action recognition has received more and more attention for its comprehensive and practical applications in intelligent surveillance and human-computer interaction. However, few-shot action recognition has not been well explored and remains challenging because of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical compositional representations (HCR) learning approach for few-shot action recognition. Specifically, we divide a complicated action into several sub-actions by carefully designed hierarchical clustering and further decompose the sub-actions into more fine-grained spatially attentional sub-actions (SAS-actions). Although there exist large differences between base classes and novel classes, they can share similar patterns in sub-actions or SAS-actions. Furthermore, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance in the transportation problem to measure the similarity between video samples in terms of sub-action representations. It computes the optimal matching flows between sub-actions as distance metric, which is favorable for comparing fine-grained patterns. Extensive experiments show our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets."
2208.09500,Causality-Inspired Taxonomy for Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"As two sides of the same coin, causality and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) were initially proposed and developed with different goals. However, the latter can only be complete when seen through the lens of the causality framework. As such, we propose a novel causality-inspired framework for xAI that creates an environment for the development of xAI approaches. To show its applicability, biometrics was used as case study. For this, we have analysed 81 research papers on a myriad of biometric modalities and different tasks. We have categorised each of these methods according to our novel xAI Ladder and discussed the future directions of the field."
2208.09657,Is Medieval Distant Viewing Possible? : Extending and Enriching   Annotation of Legacy Image Collections using Visual Analytics,"Distant viewing approaches have typically used image datasets close to the contemporary image data used to train machine learning models. To work with images from other historical periods requires expert annotated data, and the quality of labels is crucial for the quality of results. Especially when working with cultural heritage collections that contain myriad uncertainties, annotating data, or re-annotating, legacy data is an arduous task. In this paper, we describe working with two pre-annotated sets of medieval manuscript images that exhibit conflicting and overlapping metadata. Since a manual reconciliation of the two legacy ontologies would be very expensive, we aim (1) to create a more uniform set of descriptive labels to serve as a ""bridge"" in the combined dataset, and (2) to establish a high quality hierarchical classification that can be used as a valuable input for subsequent supervised machine learning. To achieve these goals, we developed visualization and interaction mechanisms, enabling medievalists to combine, regularize and extend the vocabulary used to describe these, and other cognate, image datasets. The visual interfaces provide experts an overview of relationships in the data going beyond the sum total of the metadata. Word and image embeddings as well as co-occurrences of labels across the datasets, enable batch re-annotation of images, recommendation of label candidates and support composing a hierarchical classification of labels."
2208.10100,Lirot.ai: A Novel Platform for Crowd-Sourcing Retinal Image   Segmentations,"Introduction: For supervised deep learning (DL) tasks, researchers need a large annotated dataset. In medical data science, one of the major limitations to develop DL models is the lack of annotated examples in large quantity. This is most often due to the time and expertise required to annotate. We introduce Lirot. ai, a novel platform for facilitating and crowd-sourcing image segmentations. Methods: Lirot. ai is composed of three components; an iPadOS client application named Lirot. ai-app, a backend server named Lirot. ai-server and a python API name Lirot. ai-API. Lirot. ai-app was developed in Swift 5.6 and Lirot. ai-server is a firebase backend. Lirot. ai-API allows the management of the database. Lirot. ai-app can be installed on as many iPadOS devices as needed so that annotators may be able to perform their segmentation simultaneously and remotely. We incorporate Apple Pencil compatibility, making the segmentation faster, more accurate, and more intuitive for the expert than any other computer-based alternative. Results: We demonstrate the usage of Lirot. ai for the creation of a retinal fundus dataset with reference vasculature segmentations. Discussion and future work: We will use active learning strategies to continue enlarging our retinal fundus dataset by including a more efficient process to select the images to be annotated and distribute them to annotators."
2208.10193,Convergent autoencoder approximation of low bending and low distortion   manifold embeddings,"Autoencoders, which consist of an encoder and a decoder, are widely used in machine learning for dimension reduction of high-dimensional data. The encoder embeds the input data manifold into a lower-dimensional latent space, while the decoder represents the inverse map, providing a parametrization of the data manifold by the manifold in latent space. A good regularity and structure of the embedded manifold may substantially simplify further data processing tasks such as cluster analysis or data interpolation. We propose and analyze a novel regularization for learning the encoder component of an autoencoder: a loss functional that prefers isometric, extrinsically flat embeddings and allows to train the encoder on its own. To perform the training it is assumed that for pairs of nearby points on the input manifold their local Riemannian distance and their local Riemannian average can be evaluated. The loss functional is computed via Monte Carlo integration with different sampling strategies for pairs of points on the input manifold. Our main theorem identifies a geometric loss functional of the embedding map as the $\Gamma$-limit of the sampling-dependent loss functionals. Numerical tests, using image data that encodes different explicitly given data manifolds, show that smooth manifold embeddings into latent space are obtained. Due to the promotion of extrinsic flatness, these embeddings are regular enough such that interpolation between not too distant points on the manifold is well approximated by linear interpolation in latent space as one possible postprocessing."
2208.10373,Reversing Skin Cancer Adversarial Examples by Multiscale Diffusive and   Denoising Aggregation Mechanism,"Reliable skin cancer diagnosis models play an essential role in early screening and medical intervention. Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce the performances of skin cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a simple, effective, and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative structures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects, skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models."
2208.10607,Individual Tree Detection in Large-Scale Urban Environments using   High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery,"We introduce a novel deep learning method for detection of individual trees in urban environments using high-resolution multispectral aerial imagery. We use a convolutional neural network to regress a confidence map indicating the locations of individual trees, which are localized using a peak finding algorithm. Our method provides complete spatial coverage by detecting trees in both public and private spaces, and can scale to very large areas. We performed a thorough evaluation of our method, supported by a new dataset of over 1,500 images and almost 100,000 tree annotations, covering eight cities, six climate zones, and three image capture years. We trained our model on data from Southern California, and achieved a precision of 73.6% and recall of 73.3% using test data from this region. We generally observed similar precision and slightly lower recall when extrapolating to other California climate zones and image capture dates. We used our method to produce a map of trees in the entire urban forest of California, and estimated the total number of urban trees in California to be about 43.5 million. Our study indicates the potential for deep learning methods to support future urban forestry studies at unprecedented scales."
2208.10662,How to Track and Segment Fish without Human Annotations: A   Self-Supervised Deep Learning Approach,"Tracking fish movements and sizes of fish is crucial to understanding their ecology and behaviour. Knowing where fish migrate, how they interact with their environment, and how their size affects their behaviour can help ecologists develop more effective conservation and management strategies to protect fish populations and their habitats. Deep learning is a promising tool to analyze fish ecology from underwater videos. However, training deep neural networks (DNNs) for fish tracking and segmentation requires high-quality labels, which are expensive to obtain. We propose an alternative unsupervised approach that relies on spatial and temporal variations in video data to generate noisy pseudo-ground-truth labels. We train a multitask DNN using these pseudo-labels. Our framework consists of three stages: (1) an optical flow model generates the pseudo labels using spatial and temporal consistency between frames, (2) a self-supervised model refines the pseudo-labels incrementally, and (3) a segmentation network uses the refined labels for training. Consequently, we perform extensive experiments to validate our method on three public underwater video datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness for video annotation and segmentation. We also evaluate its robustness to different imaging conditions and discuss its limitations."
2208.10769,PIFu for the Real World: A Self-supervised Framework to Reconstruct   Dressed Human from Single-view Images,"It is very challenging to accurately reconstruct sophisticated human geometry caused by various poses and garments from a single image. Recently, works based on pixel-aligned implicit function (PIFu) have made a big step and achieved state-of-the-art fidelity on image-based 3D human digitization. However, the training of PIFu relies heavily on expensive and limited 3D ground truth data (i.e. synthetic data), thus hindering its generalization to more diverse real world images. In this work, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised network named SelfPIFu to utilize abundant and diverse in-the-wild images, resulting in largely improved reconstructions when tested on unconstrained in-the-wild images. At the core of SelfPIFu is the depth-guided volume-/surface-aware signed distance fields (SDF) learning, which enables self-supervised learning of a PIFu without access to GT mesh. The whole framework consists of a normal estimator, a depth estimator, and a SDF-based PIFu and better utilizes extra depth GT during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-supervised framework and the superiority of using depth as input. On synthetic data, our Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) achieves to 93.5%, 18% higher compared with PIFuHD. For in-the-wild images, we conduct user studies on the reconstructed results, the selection rate of our results is over 68% compared with other state-of-the-art methods."
2208.10913,"Deepfake: Definitions, Performance Metrics and Standards, Datasets and   Benchmarks, and a Meta-Review","Recent advancements in AI, especially deep learning, have contributed to a significant increase in the creation of new realistic-looking synthetic media (video, image, and audio) and manipulation of existing media, which has led to the creation of the new term ``deepfake''. Based on both the research literature and resources in English and in Chinese, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of deepfake, covering multiple important aspects of this emerging concept, including 1) different definitions, 2) commonly used performance metrics and standards, and 3) deepfake-related datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks. In addition, the paper also reports a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers published in 2020 and 2021, focusing not only on the mentioned aspects, but also on the analysis of key challenges and recommendations. We believe that this paper is the most comprehensive review of deepfake in terms of aspects covered, and the first one covering both the English and Chinese literature and sources."
2208.10922,StyleTalker: One-shot Style-based Audio-driven Talking Head Video   Generation,"We propose StyleTalker, a novel audio-driven talking head generation model that can synthesize a video of a talking person from a single reference image with accurately audio-synced lip shapes, realistic head poses, and eye blinks. Specifically, by leveraging a pretrained image generator and an image encoder, we estimate the latent codes of the talking head video that faithfully reflects the given audio. This is made possible with several newly devised components: 1) A contrastive lip-sync discriminator for accurate lip synchronization, 2) A conditional sequential variational autoencoder that learns the latent motion space disentangled from the lip movements, such that we can independently manipulate the motions and lip movements while preserving the identity. 3) An auto-regressive prior augmented with normalizing flow to learn a complex audio-to-motion multi-modal latent space. Equipped with these components, StyleTalker can generate talking head videos not only in a motion-controllable way when another motion source video is given but also in a completely audio-driven manner by inferring realistic motions from the input audio. Through extensive experiments and user studies, we show that our model is able to synthesize talking head videos with impressive perceptual quality which are accurately lip-synced with the input audios, largely outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."
2208.10973,"Robust and Large-Payload DNN Watermarking via Fixed,   Distribution-Optimized, Weights","The design of an effective multi-bit watermarking algorithm hinges upon finding a good trade-off between the three fundamental requirements forming the watermarking trade-off triangle, namely, robustness against network modifications, payload, and unobtrusiveness, ensuring minimal impact on the performance of the watermarked network. In this paper, we first revisit the nature of the watermarking trade-off triangle for the DNN case, then we exploit our findings to propose a white-box, multi-bit watermarking method achieving very large payload and strong robustness against network modification. In the proposed system, the weights hosting the watermark are set prior to training, making sure that their amplitude is large enough to bear the target payload and survive network modifications, notably retraining, and are left unchanged throughout the training process. The distribution of the weights carrying the watermark is theoretically optimised to ensure the secrecy of the watermark and make sure that the watermarked weights are indistinguishable from the non-watermarked ones. The proposed method can achieve outstanding performance, with no significant impact on network accuracy, including robustness against network modifications, retraining and transfer learning, while ensuring a payload which is out of reach of state of the art methods achieving a lower - or at most comparable - robustness."
2208.11050,Tunable Hybrid Proposal Networks for the Open World,"Current state-of-the-art object proposal networks are trained with a closed-world assumption, meaning they learn to only detect objects of the training classes. These models fail to provide high recall in open-world environments where important novel objects may be encountered. While a handful of recent works attempt to tackle this problem, they fail to consider that the optimal behavior of a proposal network can vary significantly depending on the data and application. Our goal is to provide a flexible proposal solution that can be easily tuned to suit a variety of open-world settings. To this end, we design a Tunable Hybrid Proposal Network (THPN) that leverages an adjustable hybrid architecture, a novel self-training procedure, and dynamic loss components to optimize the tradeoff between known and unknown object detection performance. To thoroughly evaluate our method, we devise several new challenges which invoke varying degrees of label bias by altering known class diversity and label count. We find that in every task, THPN easily outperforms existing baselines (e.g., RPN, OLN). Our method is also highly data efficient, surpassing baseline recall with a fraction of the labeled data."
2208.11074,DepthFake: a depth-based strategy for detecting Deepfake videos,"Fake content has grown at an incredible rate over the past few years. The spread of social media and online platforms makes their dissemination on a large scale increasingly accessible by malicious actors. In parallel, due to the growing diffusion of fake image generation methods, many Deep Learning-based detection techniques have been proposed. Most of those methods rely on extracting salient features from RGB images to detect through a binary classifier if the image is fake or real. In this paper, we proposed DepthFake, a study on how to improve classical RGB-based approaches with depth-maps. The depth information is extracted from RGB images with recent monocular depth estimation techniques. Here, we demonstrate the effective contribution of depth-maps to the deepfake detection task on robust pre-trained architectures. The proposed RGBD approach is in fact able to achieve an average improvement of 3.20% and up to 11.7% for some deepfake attacks with respect to standard RGB architectures over the FaceForensic++ dataset."
2208.11346,ICANet: A Method of Short Video Emotion Recognition Driven by Multimodal   Data,"With the fast development of artificial intelligence and short videos, emotion recognition in short videos has become one of the most important research topics in human-computer interaction. At present, most emotion recognition methods still stay in a single modality. However, in daily life, human beings will usually disguise their real emotions, which leads to the problem that the accuracy of single modal emotion recognition is relatively terrible. Moreover, it is not easy to distinguish similar emotions. Therefore, we propose a new approach denoted as ICANet to achieve multimodal short video emotion recognition by employing three different modalities of audio, video and optical flow, making up for the lack of a single modality and then improving the accuracy of emotion recognition in short videos. ICANet has a better accuracy of 80.77% on the IEMOCAP benchmark, exceeding the SOTA methods by 15.89%."
2208.11353,A New Method on Mask-Wearing Detection for Natural Population Based on   Improved YOLOv4,"Recently, the domestic COVID-19 epidemic situation is serious, but in public places, some people do not wear masks or wear masks incorrectly, which requires the relevant staff to instantly remind and supervise them to wear masks correctly. However, in the face of such an important and complicated work, it is very necessary to carry out automated mask-wearing detection in public places. This paper proposes a new mask-wearing detection method based on improved YOLOv4. Specifically, firstly, we add the Coordinate Attention Module to the backbone to coordinate feature fusion and representation. Secondly, we conduct a series of network structural improvements to enhance the model performance and robustness. Thirdly, we adaptively deploy the K-means clustering algorithm to make the nine anchor boxes more suitable for our NPMD dataset. The experiments show that the improved YOLOv4 performs better, exceeding the baseline by 4.06\% AP with a comparable speed of 64.37 FPS."
2208.11450,VISTANet: VIsual Spoken Textual Additive Net for Interpretable Multimodal Emotion Recognition,"This paper proposes a multimodal emotion recognition system, VIsual Spoken Textual Additive Net (VISTANet), to classify emotions reflected by input containing image, speech, and text into discrete classes. A new interpretability technique, K-Average Additive exPlanation (KAAP), has been developed that identifies important visual, spoken, and textual features leading to predicting a particular emotion class. The VISTANet fuses information from image, speech, and text modalities using a hybrid of intermediate and late fusion. It automatically adjusts the weights of their intermediate outputs while computing the weighted average. The KAAP technique computes the contribution of each modality and corresponding features toward predicting a particular emotion class. To mitigate the insufficiency of multimodal emotion datasets labelled with discrete emotion classes, we have constructed the IIT-R MMEmoRec dataset consisting of images, corresponding speech and text, and emotion labels ('angry,' 'happy,' 'hate,' and 'sad'). The VISTANet has resulted in an overall emotion recognition accuracy of 80.11% on the IIT-R MMEmoRec dataset using visual, spoken, and textual modalities, outperforming single or dual-modality configurations. The code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/MIntelligence-Group/MMEmoRec."
2208.11650,Lane Change Classification and Prediction with Action Recognition   Networks,"Anticipating lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles is crucial for efficient and safe driving decision making in an autonomous driving system. Previous works often adopt physical variables such as driving speed, acceleration and so forth for lane change classification. However, physical variables do not contain semantic information. Although 3D CNNs have been developing rapidly, the number of methods utilising action recognition models and appearance feature for lane change recognition is low, and they all require additional information to pre-process data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework including two action recognition methods for lane change recognition, using video data collected by cameras. Our method achieves the best lane change classification results using only the RGB video data of the PREVENTION dataset. Class activation maps demonstrate that action recognition models can efficiently extract lane change motions. A method to better extract motion clues is also proposed in this paper."
2208.12259,Pix4Point: Image Pretrained Standard Transformers for 3D Point Cloud   Understanding,"While Transformers have achieved impressive success in natural language processing and computer vision, their performance on 3D point clouds is relatively poor. This is mainly due to the limitation of Transformers: a demanding need for extensive training data. Unfortunately, in the realm of 3D point clouds, the availability of large datasets is a challenge, exacerbating the issue of training Transformers for 3D tasks. In this work, we solve the data issue of point cloud Transformers from two perspectives: (i) introducing more inductive bias to reduce the dependency of Transformers on data, and (ii) relying on cross-modality pretraining. More specifically, we first present Progressive Point Patch Embedding and present a new point cloud Transformer model namely PViT. PViT shares the same backbone as Transformer but is shown to be less hungry for data, enabling Transformer to achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art. Second, we formulate a simple yet effective pipeline dubbed ""Pix4Point"" that allows harnessing Transformers pretrained in the image domain to enhance downstream point cloud understanding. This is achieved through a modality-agnostic Transformer backbone with the help of a tokenizer and decoder specialized in the different domains. Pretrained on a large number of widely available images, significant gains of PViT are observed in the tasks of 3D point cloud classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation on ScanObjectNN, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS, respectively. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/guochengqian/Pix4Point ."
2208.12306,Multimedia Generative Script Learning for Task Planning,"Goal-oriented generative script learning aims to generate subsequent steps to reach a particular goal, which is an essential task to assist robots or humans in performing stereotypical activities. An important aspect of this process is the ability to capture historical states visually, which provides detailed information that is not covered by text and will guide subsequent steps. Therefore, we propose a new task, Multimedia Generative Script Learning, to generate subsequent steps by tracking historical states in both text and vision modalities, as well as presenting the first benchmark containing 5,652 tasks and 79,089 multimedia steps. This task is challenging in three aspects: the multimedia challenge of capturing the visual states in images, the induction challenge of performing unseen tasks, and the diversity challenge of covering different information in individual steps. We propose to encode visual state changes through a selective multimedia encoder to address the multimedia challenge, transfer knowledge from previously observed tasks using a retrieval-augmented decoder to overcome the induction challenge, and further present distinct information at each step by optimizing a diversity-oriented contrastive learning objective. We define metrics to evaluate both generation and inductive quality. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines."
2208.12527,Unsupervised Spike Depth Estimation via Cross-modality Cross-domain   Knowledge Transfer,"Neuromorphic spike data, an upcoming modality with high temporal resolution, has shown promising potential in autonomous driving by mitigating the challenges posed by high-velocity motion blur. However, training the spike depth estimation network holds significant challenges in two aspects: sparse spatial information for pixel-wise tasks and difficulties in achieving paired depth labels for temporally intensive spike streams. Therefore, we introduce open-source RGB data to support spike depth estimation, leveraging its annotations and spatial information. The inherent differences in modalities and data distribution make it challenging to directly apply transfer learning from open-source RGB to target spike data. To this end, we propose a cross-modality cross-domain (BiCross) framework to realize unsupervised spike depth estimation by introducing simulated mediate source spike data. Specifically, we design a Coarse-to-Fine Knowledge Distillation (CFKD) approach to facilitate comprehensive cross-modality knowledge transfer while preserving the unique strengths of both modalities, utilizing a spike-oriented uncertainty scheme. Then, we propose a Self-Correcting Teacher-Student (SCTS) mechanism to screen out reliable pixel-wise pseudo labels and ease the domain shift of the student model, which avoids error accumulation in target spike data. To verify the effectiveness of BiCross, we conduct extensive experiments on four scenarios, including Synthetic to Real, Extreme Weather, Scene Changing, and Real Spike. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances, compared with RGB-oriented unsupervised depth estimation methods. Code and dataset: https://github.com/Theia-4869/BiCross"
2208.12550,Training and Tuning Generative Neural Radiance Fields for   Attribute-Conditional 3D-Aware Face Generation,"Generative Neural Radiance Fields (GNeRF)-based 3D-aware GANs have showcased remarkable prowess in crafting high-fidelity images while upholding robust 3D consistency, particularly face generation. However, specific existing models prioritize view consistency over disentanglement, leading to constrained semantic or attribute control during the generation process. While many methods have explored incorporating semantic masks or leveraging 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) priors to imbue models with semantic control, these methods often demand training from scratch, entailing significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: a conditional GNeRF model that integrates specific attribute labels as input, thus amplifying the controllability and disentanglement capabilities of 3D-aware generative models. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained 3D-aware face model, and we introduce a Training as Init and Optimizing for Tuning (TRIOT) method to train a conditional normalized flow module to enable the facial attribute editing, then optimize the latent vector to improve attribute-editing precision further. Our extensive experiments substantiate the efficacy of our model, showcasing its ability to generate high-quality edits with enhanced view consistency while safeguarding non-target regions. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangqianhui/TT-GNeRF."
2208.12880,Neuromorphic Visual Scene Understanding with Resonator Networks,"Analyzing a visual scene by inferring the configuration of a generative model is widely considered the most flexible and generalizable approach to scene understanding. Yet, one major problem is the computational challenge of the inference procedure, involving a combinatorial search across object identities and poses. Here we propose a neuromorphic solution exploiting three key concepts: (1) a computational framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) with complex-valued vectors; (2) the design of Hierarchical Resonator Networks (HRN) to factorize the non-commutative transforms translation and rotation in visual scenes; (3) the design of a multi-compartment spiking phasor neuron model for implementing complex-valued resonator networks on neuromorphic hardware. The VSA framework uses vector binding operations to form a generative image model in which binding acts as the equivariant operation for geometric transformations. A scene can, therefore, be described as a sum of vector products, which can then be efficiently factorized by a resonator network to infer objects and their poses. The HRN features a partitioned architecture in which vector binding is equivariant for horizontal and vertical translation within one partition and for rotation and scaling within the other partition. The spiking neuron model allows mapping the resonator network onto efficient and low-power neuromorphic hardware. Our approach is demonstrated on synthetic scenes composed of simple 2D shapes undergoing rigid geometric transformations and color changes. A companion paper demonstrates the same approach in real-world application scenarios for machine vision and robotics."
2208.13219,Visualizing high-dimensional loss landscapes with Hessian directions,"Analyzing geometric properties of high-dimensional loss functions, such as local curvature and the existence of other optima around a certain point in loss space, can help provide a better understanding of the interplay between neural network structure, implementation attributes, and learning performance. In this work, we combine concepts from high-dimensional probability and differential geometry to study how curvature properties in lower-dimensional loss representations depend on those in the original loss space. We show that saddle points in the original space are rarely correctly identified as such in expected lower-dimensional representations if random projections are used. The principal curvature in the expected lower-dimensional representation is proportional to the mean curvature in the original loss space. Hence, the mean curvature in the original loss space determines if saddle points appear, on average, as either minima, maxima, or almost flat regions. We use the connection between expected curvature in random projections and mean curvature in the original space (i.e., the normalized Hessian trace) to compute Hutchinson-type trace estimates without calculating Hessian-vector products as in the original Hutchinson method. Because random projections are not suitable to correctly identify saddle information, we propose to study projections along dominant Hessian directions that are associated with the largest and smallest principal curvatures. We connect our findings to the ongoing debate on loss landscape flatness and generalizability. Finally, for different common image classifiers and a function approximator, we show and compare random and Hessian projections of loss landscapes with up to about $7\times 10^6$ parameters."
2208.13474,Prompt Tuning with Soft Context Sharing for Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models have recently shown great potential on many tasks in computer vision. Meanwhile, prior work demonstrates prompt tuning designed for vision-language models could acquire superior performance on few-shot image recognition compared to linear probe, a strong baseline. In practice, many few-shot tasks are inherently correlated, particularly within specialized domains. However, such information is overlooked previously. Inspired by the fact that modeling task relationship by multi-task learning can usually boost performance, we propose a novel method SoftCPT (Soft Context Sharing for Prompt Tuning) to tune pre-trained vision-language models on multiple target few-shot tasks jointly. Specifically, we design a task-shared meta network to generate prompt context for each task using task name together with a learnable task context as input. The parameters of this meta network as well as the task context are tuned on the joint training set of all tasks. As such, the prompt context of all tasks will be shared in a soft manner. Extensive experiments across four multi-task few-shot datasets covering 44 tasks and 1593 categories demonstrate that SoftCPT significantly outperforms single-task prompt tuning methods, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-task learning for vision-language prompt tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/kding1225/softcpt."
2208.13504,Large-scale unsupervised spatio-temporal semantic analysis of vast   regions from satellite images sequences,"Temporal sequences of satellite images constitute a highly valuable and abundant resource for analyzing regions of interest. However, the automatic acquisition of knowledge on a large scale is a challenging task due to different factors such as the lack of precise labeled data, the definition and variability of the terrain entities, or the inherent complexity of the images and their fusion. In this context, we present a fully unsupervised and general methodology to conduct spatio-temporal taxonomies of large regions from sequences of satellite images. Our approach relies on a combination of deep embeddings and time series clustering to capture the semantic properties of the ground and its evolution over time, providing a comprehensive understanding of the region of interest. The proposed method is enhanced by a novel procedure specifically devised to refine the embedding and exploit the underlying spatio-temporal patterns. We use this methodology to conduct an in-depth analysis of a 220 km$^2$ region in northern Spain in different settings. The results provide a broad and intuitive perspective of the land where large areas are connected in a compact and well-structured manner, mainly based on climatic, phytological, and hydrological factors."
2208.14403,Verifiable Obstacle Detection,"Perception of obstacles remains a critical safety concern for autonomous vehicles. Real-world collisions have shown that the autonomy faults leading to fatal collisions originate from obstacle existence detection. Open source autonomous driving implementations show a perception pipeline with complex interdependent Deep Neural Networks. These networks are not fully verifiable, making them unsuitable for safety-critical tasks.   In this work, we present a safety verification of an existing LiDAR based classical obstacle detection algorithm. We establish strict bounds on the capabilities of this obstacle detection algorithm. Given safety standards, such bounds allow for determining LiDAR sensor properties that would reliably satisfy the standards. Such analysis has as yet been unattainable for neural network based perception systems. We provide a rigorous analysis of the obstacle detection system with empirical results based on real-world sensor data."
2208.14649,DetailCLIP: Injecting Image Details into CLIP's Feature Space,"Although CLIP-like Visual Language Models provide a functional joint feature space for image and text, due to the limitation of the CILP-like model's image input size (e.g., 224), subtle details are lost in the feature representation if we input high-resolution images (e.g., 2240). In this work, we introduce an efficient framework that can produce a single feature representation for a high-resolution image that injects image details and shares the same semantic space as the original CLIP. In the framework, we train a feature fusing model based on CLIP features extracted from a carefully designed image patch method that can cover objects of any scale, weakly supervised by image-agnostic class prompted queries. We validate our framework by retrieving images from class prompted queries on the real world and synthetic datasets, showing significant performance improvement on these tasks. Furthermore, to fully demonstrate our framework's detail retrieval ability, we construct a CLEVR-like synthetic dataset called CLVER-DS, which is fully annotated and has a controllable object scale."
2208.14784,Practical Operator Sketching Framework for Accelerating Iterative   Data-Driven Solutions in Inverse Problems,"We propose a new operator-sketching paradigm for designing efficient iterative data-driven reconstruction (IDR) schemes, e.g. Plug-and-Play algorithms and deep unrolling networks. These IDR schemes are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, these IDR schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. In this work, we explore and propose a universal dimensionality reduction framework for accelerating IDR schemes in solving imaging inverse problems, based on leveraging the sketching techniques from stochastic optimization. Using this framework, we derive a number of accelerated IDR schemes, such as the plug-and-play multi-stage sketched gradient (PnP-MS2G) and sketching-based primal-dual (LSPD and Sk-LSPD) deep unrolling networks. Meanwhile, for fully accelerating PnP schemes when the denoisers are computationally expensive, we provide novel stochastic lazy denoising schemes (Lazy-PnP and Lazy-PnP-EQ), leveraging the ProxSkip scheme in optimization and equivariant image denoisers, which can massively accelerate the PnP algorithms with improved practicality. We provide theoretical analysis for recovery guarantees of instances of the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments on natural image processing and tomographic image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our sketched IDR schemes."
2208.14839,QuantNAS for super resolution: searching for efficient   quantization-friendly architectures against quantization noise,"There is a constant need for high-performing and computationally efficient neural network models for image super-resolution: computationally efficient models can be used via low-capacity devices and reduce carbon footprints. One way to obtain such models is to compress models, e.g. quantization. Another way is a neural architecture search that automatically discovers new, more efficient solutions. We propose a novel quantization-aware procedure, the QuantNAS that combines pros of these two approaches. To make QuantNAS work, the procedure looks for quantization-friendly super-resolution models. The approach utilizes entropy regularization, quantization noise, and Adaptive Deviation for Quantization (ADQ) module to enhance the search procedure. The entropy regularization technique prioritizes a single operation within each block of the search space. Adding quantization noise to parameters and activations approximates model degradation after quantization, resulting in a more quantization-friendly architectures. ADQ helps to alleviate problems caused by Batch Norm blocks in super-resolution models. Our experimental results show that the proposed approximations are better for search procedure than direct model quantization. QuantNAS discovers architectures with better PSNR/BitOps trade-off than uniform or mixed precision quantization of fixed architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method through its application to two search spaces inspired by the state-of-the-art SR models and RFDN. Thus, anyone can design a proper search space based on an existing architecture and apply our method to obtain better quality and efficiency.   The proposed procedure is 30\% faster than direct weight quantization and is more stable."
2209.00381,SemSegDepth: A Combined Model for Semantic Segmentation and Depth   Completion,"Holistic scene understanding is pivotal for the performance of autonomous machines. In this paper we propose a new end-to-end model for performing semantic segmentation and depth completion jointly. The vast majority of recent approaches have developed semantic segmentation and depth completion as independent tasks. Our approach relies on RGB and sparse depth as inputs to our model and produces a dense depth map and the corresponding semantic segmentation image. It consists of a feature extractor, a depth completion branch, a semantic segmentation branch and a joint branch which further processes semantic and depth information altogether. The experiments done on Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, demonstrate and provide further evidence, that combining both tasks, semantic segmentation and depth completion, in a multi-task network can effectively improve the performance of each task. Code is available at https://github.com/juanb09111/semantic depth."
2209.00796,Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods and Applications,"Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful new family of deep generative models with record-breaking performance in many applications, including image synthesis, video generation, and molecule design. In this survey, we provide an overview of the rapidly expanding body of work on diffusion models, categorizing the research into three key areas: efficient sampling, improved likelihood estimation, and handling data with special structures. We also discuss the potential for combining diffusion models with other generative models for enhanced results. We further review the wide-ranging applications of diffusion models in fields spanning from computer vision, natural language generation, temporal data modeling, to interdisciplinary applications in other scientific disciplines. This survey aims to provide a contextualized, in-depth look at the state of diffusion models, identifying the key areas of focus and pointing to potential areas for further exploration.

2209.00915,Detection of diabetic retinopathy using longitudinal self-supervised   learning,"Longitudinal imaging is able to capture both static anatomical structures and dynamic changes in disease progression towards earlier and better patient-specific pathology management. However, conventional approaches for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) rarely take advantage of longitudinal information to improve DR analysis. In this work, we investigate the benefit of exploiting self-supervised learning with a longitudinal nature for DR diagnosis purposes. We compare different longitudinal self-supervised learning (LSSL) methods to model the disease progression from longitudinal retinal color fundus photographs (CFP) to detect early DR severity changes using a pair of consecutive exams. The experiments were conducted on a longitudinal DR screening dataset with or without those trained encoders (LSSL) acting as a longitudinal pretext task. Results achieve an AUC of 0.875 for the baseline (model trained from scratch) and an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.9593-0.9655 DeLong test) with a p-value < 2.2e-16 on early fusion using a simple ResNet alike architecture with frozen LSSL weights, suggesting that the LSSL latent space enables to encode the dynamic of DR progression."
2209.00990,Self-Supervised Human Activity Recognition with Localized Time-Frequency   Contrastive Representation Learning,"In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning solution for human activity recognition with smartphone accelerometer data. We aim to develop a model that learns strong representations from accelerometer signals, in order to perform robust human activity classification, while reducing the model's reliance on class labels. Specifically, we intend to enable cross-dataset transfer learning such that our network pre-trained on a particular dataset can perform effective activity classification on other datasets (successive to a small amount of fine-tuning). To tackle this problem, we design our solution with the intention of learning as much information from the accelerometer signals as possible. As a result, we design two separate pipelines, one that learns the data in time-frequency domain, and the other in time-domain alone. In order to address the issues mentioned above in regards to cross-dataset transfer learning, we use self-supervised contrastive learning to train each of these streams. Next, each stream is fine-tuned for final classification, and eventually the two are fused to provide the final results. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution on three datasets, namely MotionSense, HAPT, and HHAR, and demonstrate that our solution outperforms prior works in this field. We further evaluate the performance of the method in learning generalized features, by using MobiAct dataset for pre-training and the remaining three datasets for the downstream classification task, and show that the proposed solution achieves better performance in comparison with other self-supervised methods in cross-dataset transfer learning."
2209.01019,On Quantizing Implicit Neural Representations,"The role of quantization within implicit/coordinate neural networks is still not fully understood. We note that using a canonical fixed quantization scheme during training produces poor performance at low-rates due to the network weight distributions changing over the course of training. In this work, we show that a non-uniform quantization of neural weights can lead to significant improvements. Specifically, we demonstrate that a clustered quantization enables improved reconstruction. Finally, by characterising a trade-off between quantization and network capacity, we demonstrate that it is possible (while memory inefficient) to reconstruct signals using binary neural networks. We demonstrate our findings experimentally on 2D image reconstruction and 3D radiance fields; and show that simple quantization methods and architecture search can achieve compression of NeRF to less than 16kb with minimal loss in performance (323x smaller than the original NeRF)."
2209.01072,Fiducial Tag Localization on a 3D LiDAR Prior Map,"The LiDAR fiducial tag, akin to the well-known AprilTag used in camera applications, serves as a convenient resource to impart artificial features to the LiDAR sensor, facilitating robotics applications. Unfortunately, the existing LiDAR fiducial tag localization methods do not apply to 3D LiDAR maps while resolving this problem is beneficial to LiDAR-based relocalization and navigation. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to directly localize fiducial tags on a 3D LiDAR prior map, returning the tag poses (labeled by ID number) and vertex locations (labeled by index) w.r.t. the global coordinate system of the map. In particular, considering that fiducial tags are thin sheet objects indistinguishable from the attached planes, we design a new pipeline that gradually analyzes the 3D point cloud of the map from the intensity and geometry perspectives, extracting potential tag-containing point clusters. Then, we introduce an intermediate-plane-based method to further check if each potential cluster has a tag and compute the vertex locations and tag pose if found. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that our approach is the first method applicable to localize tags on a 3D LiDAR map while achieving better accuracy compared to previous methods. The open-source implementation of this work is available at: https://github.com/York-SDCNLab/Marker-Detection-General."
2209.01205,Hierarchical Relational Learning for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations, and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git."
2209.01339,DSE-GAN: Dynamic Semantic Evolution Generative Adversarial Network for   Text-to-Image Generation,"Text-to-image generation aims at generating realistic images which are semantically consistent with the given text. Previous works mainly adopt the multi-stage architecture by stacking generator-discriminator pairs to engage multiple adversarial training, where the text semantics used to provide generation guidance remain static across all stages. This work argues that text features at each stage should be adaptively re-composed conditioned on the status of the historical stage (i.e., historical stage's text and image features) to provide diversified and accurate semantic guidance during the coarse-to-fine generation process. We thereby propose a novel Dynamical Semantic Evolution GAN (DSE-GAN) to re-compose each stage's text features under a novel single adversarial multi-stage architecture. Specifically, we design (1) Dynamic Semantic Evolution (DSE) module, which first aggregates historical image features to summarize the generative feedback, and then dynamically selects words required to be re-composed at each stage as well as re-composed them by dynamically enhancing or suppressing different granularity subspace's semantics. (2) Single Adversarial Multi-stage Architecture (SAMA), which extends the previous structure by eliminating complicated multiple adversarial training requirements and therefore allows more stages of text-image interactions, and finally facilitates the DSE module. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that DSE-GAN achieves 7.48\% and 37.8\% relative FID improvement on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., CUB-200 and MSCOCO, respectively."
2209.01375,A Variational Approach for Joint Image Recovery and Feature Extraction   Based on Spatially-Varying Generalised Gaussian Models,"The joint problem of reconstruction / feature extraction is a challenging task in image processing. It consists in performing, in a joint manner, the restoration of an image and the extraction of its features. In this work, we firstly propose a novel nonsmooth and non-convex variational formulation of the problem. For this purpose, we introduce a versatile generalised Gaussian prior whose parameters, including its exponent, are space-variant. Secondly, we design an alternating proximal-based optimisation algorithm that efficiently exploits the structure of the proposed non-convex objective function. We also analyse the convergence of this algorithm. As shown in numerical experiments conducted on joint deblurring/segmentation tasks, the proposed method provides high-quality results."
2209.01380,Classification of Breast Tumours Based on Histopathology Images Using   Deep Features and Ensemble of Gradient Boosting Methods,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Early-stage diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve the efficiency of treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are widely adopted in this issue due to their reliability, accuracy and affordability. There are different imaging techniques for a breast cancer diagnosis; one of the most accurate ones is histopathology which is used in this paper. Deep feature transfer learning is used as the main idea of the proposed CAD system's feature extractor. Although 16 different pre-trained networks have been tested in this study, our main focus is on the classification phase. The Inception-ResNet-v2 which has both residual and inception networks profits together has shown the best feature extraction capability in the case of breast cancer histopathology images among all tested CNNs. In the classification phase, the ensemble of CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM has provided the best average accuracy. The BreakHis dataset was used to evaluate the proposed method. BreakHis contains 7909 histopathology images (2,480 benign and 5,429 malignant) in four magnification factors. The proposed method's accuracy (IRv2-CXL) using 70% of BreakHis dataset as training data in 40x, 100x, 200x and 400x magnification is 96.82%, 95.84%, 97.01% and 96.15%, respectively. Most studies on automated breast cancer detection have focused on feature extraction, which made us attend to the classification phase. IRv2-CXL has shown better or comparable results in all magnifications due to using the soft voting ensemble method which could combine the advantages of CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM together."
2209.01760,REQA: Coarse-to-fine Assessment of Image Quality to Alleviate the Range   Effect,"Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) of user generated content (UGC) suffers from the range effect which indicates that on the overall quality range, mean opinion score (MOS) and predicted MOS (pMOS) are well correlated; focusing on a particular range, the correlation is lower. The reason for the range effect is that the predicted deviations both in a wide range and in a narrow range destroy the uniformity between MOS and pMOS. To tackle this problem, a novel method is proposed from coarse-grained metric to fine-grained prediction. Firstly, we design a rank-and-gradient loss for coarse-grained metric. The loss keeps the order and grad consistency between pMOS and MOS, thereby reducing the predicted deviation in a wide range. Secondly, we propose multi-level tolerance loss to make fine-grained prediction. The loss is constrained by a decreasing threshold to limite the predicted deviation in narrower and narrower ranges. Finally, we design a feedback network to conduct the coarse-to-fine assessment. On the one hand, the network adopts feedback blocks to process multi-scale distortion features iteratively and on the other hand, it fuses non-local context feature to the output of each iteration to acquire more quality-aware feature representation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can alleviate the range effect compared to the state-of-the-art methods effectively."
2209.01763,Uformer-ICS: A U-Shaped Transformer for Image Compressive Sensing   Service,"Many service computing applications require real-time dataset collection from multiple devices, necessitating efficient sampling techniques to reduce bandwidth and storage pressure. Compressive sensing (CS) has found wide-ranging applications in image acquisition and reconstruction. Recently, numerous deep-learning methods have been introduced for CS tasks. However, the accurate reconstruction of images from measurements remains a significant challenge, especially at low sampling rates. In this paper, we propose Uformer-ICS as a novel U-shaped transformer for image CS tasks by introducing inner characteristics of CS into transformer architecture. To utilize the uneven sparsity distribution of image blocks, we design an adaptive sampling architecture that allocates measurement resources based on the estimated block sparsity, allowing the compressed results to retain maximum information from the original image. Additionally, we introduce a multi-channel projection (MCP) module inspired by traditional CS optimization methods. By integrating the MCP module into the transformer blocks, we construct projection-based transformer blocks, and then form a symmetrical reconstruction model using these blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Therefore, our reconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and long-range dependencies of image, and the prior projection knowledge of CS theory.   Experimental results demonstrate its significantly better reconstruction performance than state-of-the-art deep learning-based CS methods."
2209.01870,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Style-Aware Self-intermediate Domain,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted considerable attention, which transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a crucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there is a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a novel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap and transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative information. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a novel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two seemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary synthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of SSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and then randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer. Moreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified labeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features. Based on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions are designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature compatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature space of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by mathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly used domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the experimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with different backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out module."
2209.02000,Visual Odometry with Neuromorphic Resonator Networks,"Visual Odometry (VO) is a method to estimate self-motion of a mobile robot using visual sensors. Unlike odometry based on integrating differential measurements that can accumulate errors, such as inertial sensors or wheel encoders, visual odometry is not compromised by drift. However, image-based VO is computationally demanding, limiting its application in use cases with low-latency, -memory, and -energy requirements. Neuromorphic hardware offers low-power solutions to many vision and AI problems, but designing such solutions is complicated and often has to be assembled from scratch. Here we propose to use Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) as an abstraction layer to design algorithms compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Building from a VSA model for scene analysis, described in our companion paper, we present a modular neuromorphic algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two-dimensional VO tasks. Specifically, the proposed algorithm stores and updates a working memory of the presented visual environment. Based on this working memory, a resonator network estimates the changing location and orientation of the camera. We experimentally validate the neuromorphic VSA-based approach to VO with two benchmarks: one based on an event camera dataset and the other in a dynamic scene with a robotic task."
2209.02200,Task-wise Sampling Convolutions for Arbitrary-Oriented Object Detection   in Aerial Images,"Arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) has been widely applied to locate and classify objects with diverse orientations in remote sensing images. However, the inconsistent features for the localization and classification tasks in AOOD models may lead to ambiguity and low-quality object predictions, which constrains the detection performance. In this article, an AOOD method called task-wise sampling convolutions (TS-Conv) is proposed. TS-Conv adaptively samples task-wise features from respective sensitive regions and maps these features together in alignment to guide a dynamic label assignment for better predictions. Specifically, sampling positions of the localization convolution in TS-Conv are supervised by the oriented bounding box (OBB) prediction associated with spatial coordinates, while sampling positions and convolutional kernel of the classification convolution are designed to be adaptively adjusted according to different orientations for improving the orientation robustness of features. Furthermore, a dynamic task-consistent-aware label assignment (DTLA) strategy is developed to select optimal candidate positions and assign labels dynamically according to ranked task-aware scores obtained from TS-Conv. Extensive experiments on several public datasets covering multiple scenes, multimodal images, and multiple categories of objects demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and superior performance of the proposed TS-Conv."
2209.02890,Data-Driven Target Localization Using Adaptive Radar Processing and   Convolutional Neural Networks,"Leveraging the advanced functionalities of modern radio frequency (RF) modeling and simulation tools, specifically designed for adaptive radar processing applications, this paper presents a data-driven approach to improve accuracy in radar target localization post adaptive radar detection. To this end, we generate a large number of radar returns by randomly placing targets of variable strengths in a predefined area, using RFView, a high-fidelity, site-specific, RF modeling & simulation tool. We produce heatmap tensors from the radar returns, in range, azimuth [and Doppler], of the normalized adaptive matched filter (NAMF) test statistic. We then train a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate target locations from these heatmap tensors, and we compare the target localization accuracy of this approach with that of peak-finding and local search methods. This empirical study shows that our regression CNN achieves a considerable improvement in target location estimation accuracy. The regression CNN offers significant gains and reasonable accuracy even at signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) regimes that are close to the breakdown threshold SCNR of the NAMF. We also study the robustness of our trained CNN to mismatches in the radar data, where the CNN is tested on heatmap tensors collected from areas that it was not trained on. We show that our CNN can be made robust to mismatches in the radar data through few-shot learning, using a relatively small number of new training samples."
2209.03132,MSSPN: Automatic First Arrival Picking using Multi-Stage Segmentation   Picking Network,"Picking the first arrival times of prestack gathers is called First Arrival Time (FAT) picking, which is an indispensable step in seismic data processing, and is mainly solved manually in the past. With the current increasing density of seismic data collection, the efficiency of manual picking has been unable to meet the actual needs. Therefore, automatic picking methods have been greatly developed in recent decades, especially those based on deep learning. However, few of the current supervised deep learning-based method can avoid the dependence on labeled samples. Besides, since the gather data is a set of signals which are greatly different from the natural images, it is difficult for the current method to solve the FAT picking problem in case of a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, for hard rock seismic gather data, we propose a Multi-Stage Segmentation Pickup Network (MSSPN), which solves the generalization problem across worksites and the picking problem in the case of low SNR. In MSSPN, there are four sub-models to simulate the manually picking processing, which is assumed to four stages from coarse to fine. Experiments on seven field datasets with different qualities show that our MSSPN outperforms benchmarks by a large margin.Particularly, our method can achieve more than 90\% accurate picking across worksites in the case of medium and high SNRs, and even fine-tuned model can achieve 88\% accurate picking of the dataset with low SNR."
2209.03440,Deep Learning-Based Automatic Diagnosis System for Developmental   Dysplasia of the Hip,"Objective: The clinical diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) typically involves manually measuring key radiological angles -- Center-Edge (CE), Tonnis, and Sharp angles -- from pelvic radiographs, a process that is time-consuming and susceptible to variability. This study aims to develop an automated system that integrates these measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency of DDH diagnosis.   Methods and procedures: We developed an end-to-end deep learning model for keypoint detection that accurately identifies eight anatomical keypoints from pelvic radiographs, enabling the automated calculation of CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles. To support the diagnostic decision, we introduced a novel data-driven scoring system that combines the information from all three angles into a comprehensive and explainable diagnostic output.   Results: The system demonstrated superior consistency in angle measurements compared to a cohort of eight moderately experienced orthopedists. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles were 0.957 (95% CI: 0.952--0.962), 0.942 (95% CI: 0.937--0.947), and 0.966 (95% CI: 0.964--0.968), respectively. The system achieved a diagnostic F1 score of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.851--0.876), significantly outperforming the orthopedist group (0.777, 95% CI: 0.737--0.817, p = 0.005), as well as using clinical diagnostic criteria for each angle individually (p<0.001).   Conclusion: The proposed system provides reliable and consistent automated measurements of radiological angles and an explainable diagnostic output for DDH, outperforming moderately experienced clinicians.   Clinical impact: This AI-powered solution reduces the variability and potential errors of manual measurements, offering clinicians a more consistent and interpretable tool for DDH diagnosis."
2209.03737,CGAN-ECT: Tomography Image Reconstruction from Electrical Capacitance   Measurements Using CGANs,"Due to the rapid growth of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) applications in several industrial fields, there is a crucial need for developing high quality, yet fast, methodologies of image reconstruction from raw capacitance measurements. Deep learning, as an effective non-linear mapping tool for complicated functions, has been going viral in many fields including electrical tomography. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for reconstructing ECT images from capacitance measurements. The initial image of the CGAN model is constructed from the capacitance measurement. To our knowledge, this is the first time to represent the capacitance measurements in an image form. We have created a new massive ECT dataset of 320K synthetic image measurements pairs for training, and testing the proposed model. The feasibility and generalization ability of the proposed CGAN-ECT model are evaluated using testing dataset, contaminated data and flow patterns that are not exposed to the model during the training phase. The evaluation results prove that the proposed CGAN-ECT model can efficiently create more accurate ECT images than traditional and other deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithms. CGAN-ECT achieved an average image correlation coefficient of more than 99.3% and an average relative image error about 0.07."
2209.03832,T2LR-Net: An unrolling network learning transformed tensor low-rank   prior for dynamic MR image reconstruction,"The tensor low-rank prior has attracted considerable attention in dynamic MR reconstruction. Tensor low-rank methods preserve the inherent high-dimensional structure of data, allowing for improved extraction and utilization of intrinsic low-rank characteristics. However, most current methods are still confined to utilizing low-rank structures either in the image domain or predefined transformed domains. Designing an optimal transformation adaptable to dynamic MRI reconstruction through manual efforts is inherently challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling network that utilizes the convolutional neural network (CNN) to adaptively learn the transformed domain for leveraging tensor low-rank priors. Under the supervised mechanism, the learning of the tensor low-rank domain is directly guided by the reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we generalize the traditional t-SVD to a transformed version based on arbitrary high-dimensional unitary transformations and introduce a novel unitary transformed tensor nuclear norm (UTNN). Subsequently, we present a dynamic MRI reconstruction model based on UTNN and devise an efficient iterative optimization algorithm using ADMM, which is finally unfolded into the proposed T2LR-Net. Experiments on two dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that T2LR-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization-based and unrolling network-based methods."
2209.03910,PixTrack: Precise 6DoF Object Pose Tracking using NeRF Templates and   Feature-metric Alignment,"We present PixTrack, a vision based object pose tracking framework using novel view synthesis and deep feature-metric alignment. We follow an SfM-based relocalization paradigm where we use a Neural Radiance Field to canonically represent the tracked object. Our evaluations demonstrate that our method produces highly accurate, robust, and jitter-free 6DoF pose estimates of objects in both monocular RGB images and RGB-D images without the need of any data annotation or trajectory smoothing. Our method is also computationally efficient making it easy to have multi-object tracking with no alteration to our algorithm through simple CPU multiprocessing. Our code is available at: https://github.com/GiantAI/pixtrack"
2209.04517,Affinity-VAE: incorporating prior knowledge in representation learning   from scientific images,"Learning compact and interpretable representations of data is a critical challenge in scientific image analysis. Here, we introduce Affinity-VAE, a generative model that enables us to impose our scientific intuition about the similarity of instances in the dataset on the learned representation during training. We demonstrate the utility of the approach in the scientific domain of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) where a significant current challenge is to identify similar molecules within a noisy and low contrast tomographic image volume. This task is distinct from classification in that, at inference time, it is unknown whether an instance is part of the training set or not. We trained affinity-VAE using prior knowledge of protein structure to inform the latent space. Our model is able to create rotationally-invariant, morphologically homogeneous clusters in the latent representation, with improved cluster separation compared to other approaches. It achieves competitive performance on protein classification with the added benefit of disentangling object pose, structural similarity and an interpretable latent representation. In the context of cryo-ET data, affinity-VAE captures the orientation of identified proteins in 3D which can be used as a prior for subsequent scientific experiments. Extracting physical principles from a trained network is of significant importance in scientific imaging where a ground truth training set is not always feasible."
2209.04648,CoreDeep: Improving Crack Detection Algorithms Using Width Stochasticity,"Automatically detecting or segmenting cracks in images can help in reducing the cost of maintenance or operations. Detecting, measuring and quantifying cracks for distress analysis in challenging background scenarios is a difficult task as there is no clear boundary that separates cracks from the background. Developed algorithms should handle the inherent challenges associated with data. Some of the perceptually noted challenges are color, intensity, depth, blur, motion-blur, orientation, different region of interest (ROI) for the defect, scale, illumination, complex and challenging background, etc. These variations occur across (crack inter class) and within images (crack intra-class variabilities). Overall, there is significant background (inter) and foreground (intra-class) variability. In this work, we have attempted to reduce the effect of these variations in challenging background scenarios. We have proposed a stochastic width (SW) approach to reduce the effect of these variations. Our proposed approach improves detectability and significantly reduces false positives and negatives. We have measured the performance of our algorithm objectively in terms of mean IoU, false positives and negatives and subjectively in terms of perceptual quality."
2209.04747,Diffusion Models in Vision: A Survey,"Denoising diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for future research."
2209.04821,Local-Aware Global Attention Network for Person Re-Identification Based   on Body and Hand Images,"Learning representative, robust and discriminative information from images is essential for effective person re-identification (Re-Id). In this paper, we propose a compound approach for end-to-end discriminative deep feature learning for person Re-Id based on both body and hand images. We carefully design the Local-Aware Global Attention Network (LAGA-Net), a multi-branch deep network architecture consisting of one branch for spatial attention, one branch for channel attention, one branch for global feature representations and another branch for local feature representations. The attention branches focus on the relevant features of the image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. The global branch intends to preserve the global context or structural information. For the the local branch, which intends to capture the fine-grained information, we perform uniform partitioning to generate stripes on the conv-layer horizontally. We retrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly partitioning the images or requiring external cues such as pose estimation. A set of ablation study shows that each component contributes to the increased performance of the LAGA-Net. Extensive evaluations on four popular body-based person Re-Id benchmarks and two publicly available hand datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
2209.04847,Deep Lossy Plus Residual Coding for Lossless and Near-lossless Image   Compression,"Lossless and near-lossless image compression is of paramount importance to professional users in many technical fields, such as medicine, remote sensing, precision engineering and scientific research. But despite rapidly growing research interests in learning-based image compression, no published method offers both lossless and near-lossless modes. In this paper, we propose a unified and powerful deep lossy plus residual (DLPR) coding framework for both lossless and near-lossless image compression. In the lossless mode, the DLPR coding system first performs lossy compression and then lossless coding of residuals. We solve the joint lossy and residual compression problem in the approach of VAEs, and add autoregressive context modeling of the residuals to enhance lossless compression performance. In the near-lossless mode, we quantize the original residuals to satisfy a given $\ell_\infty$ error bound, and propose a scalable near-lossless compression scheme that works for variable $\ell_\infty$ bounds instead of training multiple networks. To expedite the DLPR coding, we increase the degree of algorithm parallelization by a novel design of coding context, and accelerate the entropy coding with adaptive residual interval. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLPR coding system achieves both the state-of-the-art lossless and near-lossless image compression performance with competitive coding speed."
2209.04851,OpenMixup: Open Mixup Toolbox and Benchmark for Visual Representation   Learning,"Mixup augmentation has emerged as a widely used technique for improving the generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the lack of standardized implementations and benchmarks has impeded recent progress, resulting in poor reproducibility, unfair comparisons, and conflicting insights. In this paper, we introduce OpenMixup, the first mixup augmentation codebase, and benchmark for visual representation learning. Specifically, we train 18 representative mixup baselines from scratch and rigorously evaluate them across 11 image datasets of varying scales and granularity, ranging from fine-grained scenarios to complex non-iconic scenes. We also open-source our modular codebase, including a collection of popular vision backbones, optimization strategies, and analysis toolkits, which not only supports the benchmarking but enables broader mixup applications beyond classification, such as self-supervised learning and regression tasks. Through experiments and empirical analysis, we gain observations and insights on mixup performance-efficiency trade-offs, generalization, and optimization behaviors, and thereby identify preferred choices for different needs. To the best of our knowledge, OpenMixup has facilitated several recent studies. We believe this work can further advance reproducible mixup augmentation research and thereby lay a solid ground for future progress in the community. The source code and user documents are available at \url{https://github.com/Westlake-AI/openmixup}."
2209.05044,Predicting the Next Action by Modeling the Abstract Goal,"The problem of anticipating human actions is an inherently uncertain one. However, we can reduce this uncertainty if we have a sense of the goal that the actor is trying to achieve. Here, we present an action anticipation model that leverages goal information for the purpose of reducing the uncertainty in future predictions. Since we do not possess goal information or the observed actions during inference, we resort to visual representation to encapsulate information about both actions and goals. Through this, we derive a novel concept called abstract goal which is conditioned on observed sequences of visual features for action anticipation. We design the abstract goal as a distribution whose parameters are estimated using a variational recurrent network. We sample multiple candidates for the next action and introduce a goal consistency measure to determine the best candidate that follows from the abstract goal. Our method obtains impressive results on the very challenging Epic-Kitchens55 (EK55), EK100, and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. We obtain absolute improvements of +13.69, +11.24, and +5.19 for Top-1 verb, Top-1 noun, and Top-1 action anticipation accuracy respectively over prior state-of-the-art methods for seen kitchens (S1) of EK55. Similarly, we also obtain significant improvements in the unseen kitchens (S2) set for Top-1 verb (+10.75), noun (+5.84) and action (+2.87) anticipation. Similar trend is observed for EGTEA Gaze+ dataset, where absolute improvement of +9.9, +13.1 and +6.8 is obtained for noun, verb, and action anticipation. It is through the submission of this paper that our method is currently the new state-of-the-art for action anticipation in EK55 and EGTEA Gaze+ https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20071#results Code available at https://github.com/debadityaroy/Abstract_Goal"
2209.05135,Signs of Language: Embodied Sign Language Fingerspelling Acquisition   from Demonstrations for Human-Robot Interaction,"Learning fine-grained movements is a challenging topic in robotics, particularly in the context of robotic hands. One specific instance of this challenge is the acquisition of fingerspelling sign language in robots. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning dexterous motor imitation from video examples without additional information. To achieve this, we first build a URDF model of a robotic hand with a single actuator for each joint. We then leverage pre-trained deep vision models to extract the 3D pose of the hand from RGB videos. Next, using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for motion imitation (namely, proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic), we train a policy to reproduce the movement extracted from the demonstrations. We identify the optimal set of hyperparameters for imitation based on a reference motion. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by testing it on six different tasks, corresponding to fingerspelled letters. Our results show that our approach is able to successfully imitate these fine-grained movements without additional information, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in robotics."
2209.05227,DUET: A Tuning-Free Device-Cloud Collaborative Parameters Generation   Framework for Efficient Device Model Generalization,"Device Model Generalization (DMG) is a practical yet under-investigated research topic for on-device machine learning applications. It aims to improve the generalization ability of pre-trained models when deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as improving the performance of pre-trained cloud models on smart mobiles. While quite a lot of works have investigated the data distribution shift across clouds and devices, most of them focus on model fine-tuning on personalized data for individual devices to facilitate DMG. Despite their promising, these approaches require on-device re-training, which is practically infeasible due to the overfitting problem and high time delay when performing gradient calculation on real-time data. In this paper, we argue that the computational cost brought by fine-tuning can be rather unnecessary. We consequently present a novel perspective to improving DMG without increasing computational cost, i.e., device-specific parameter generation which directly maps data distribution to parameters. Specifically, we propose an efficient Device-cloUd collaborative parametErs generaTion framework DUET. DUET is deployed on a powerful cloud server that only requires the low cost of forwarding propagation and low time delay of data transmission between the device and the cloud. By doing so, DUET can rehearse the device-specific model weight realizations conditioned on the personalized real-time data for an individual device. Importantly, our DUET elegantly connects the cloud and device as a 'duet' collaboration, frees the DMG from fine-tuning, and enables a faster and more accurate DMG paradigm. We conduct an extensive experimental study of DUET on three public datasets, and the experimental results confirm our framework's effectiveness and generalisability for different DMG tasks."
2209.05321,Deep Feature Statistics Mapping for Generalized Screen Content Image   Quality Assessment,"The statistical regularities of natural images, referred to as natural scene statistics, play an important role in no-reference image quality assessment. However, it has been widely acknowledged that screen content images (SCIs), which are typically computer generated, do not hold such statistics. Here we make the first attempt to learn the statistics of SCIs, based upon which the quality of SCIs can be effectively determined. The underlying mechanism of the proposed approach is based upon the mild assumption that the SCIs, which are not physically acquired, still obey certain statistics that could be understood in a learning fashion. We empirically show that the statistics deviation could be effectively leveraged in quality assessment, and the proposed method is superior when evaluated in different settings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the Deep Feature Statistics based SCI Quality Assessment (DFSS-IQA) model delivers promising performance compared with existing NR-IQA models and shows a high generalization capability in the cross-dataset settings. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/Baoliang93/DFSS-IQA."
2209.05407,Segmenting Known Objects and Unseen Unknowns without Prior Knowledge,"Panoptic segmentation methods assign a known class to each pixel given in input. Even for state-of-the-art approaches, this inevitably enforces decisions that systematically lead to wrong predictions for objects outside the training categories. However, robustness against out-of-distribution samples and corner cases is crucial in safety-critical settings to avoid dangerous consequences. Since real-world datasets cannot contain enough data points to adequately sample the long tail of the underlying distribution, models must be able to deal with unseen and unknown scenarios as well. Previous methods targeted this by re-identifying already-seen unlabeled objects. In this work, we propose the necessary step to extend segmentation with a new setting which we term holistic segmentation. Holistic segmentation aims to identify and separate objects of unseen, unknown categories into instances without any prior knowledge about them while performing panoptic segmentation of known classes. We tackle this new problem with U3HS, which finds unknowns as highly uncertain regions and clusters their corresponding instance-aware embeddings into individual objects. By doing so, for the first time in panoptic segmentation with unknown objects, our U3HS is trained without unknown categories, reducing assumptions and leaving the settings as unconstrained as in real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments on public data from MS COCO, Cityscapes, and Lost&Found demonstrate the effectiveness of U3HS for this new, challenging, and assumptions-free setting called holistic segmentation.

2209.05557,Blurring Diffusion Models,"Recently, Rissanen et al., (2022) have presented a new type of diffusion process for generative modeling based on heat dissipation, or blurring, as an alternative to isotropic Gaussian diffusion. Here, we show that blurring can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise. In making this connection, we bridge the gap between inverse heat dissipation and denoising diffusion, and we shed light on the inductive bias that results from this modeling choice. Finally, we propose a generalized class of diffusion models that offers the best of both standard Gaussian denoising diffusion and inverse heat dissipation, which we call Blurring Diffusion Models."
2209.05653,Semantic2Graph: Graph-based Multi-modal Feature Fusion for Action   Segmentation in Videos,"Video action segmentation have been widely applied in many fields. Most previous studies employed video-based vision models for this purpose. However, they often rely on a large receptive field, LSTM or Transformer methods to capture long-term dependencies within videos, leading to significant computational resource requirements. To address this challenge, graph-based model was proposed. However, previous graph-based models are less accurate. Hence, this study introduces a graph-structured approach named Semantic2Graph, to model long-term dependencies in videos, thereby reducing computational costs and raise the accuracy. We construct a graph structure of video at the frame-level. Temporal edges are utilized to model the temporal relations and action order within videos. Additionally, we have designed positive and negative semantic edges, accompanied by corresponding edge weights, to capture both long-term and short-term semantic relationships in video actions. Node attributes encompass a rich set of multi-modal features extracted from video content, graph structures, and label text, encompassing visual, structural, and semantic cues. To synthesize this multi-modal information effectively, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) model to fuse multi-modal features for node action label classification. Experimental results demonstrate that Semantic2Graph outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance, particularly on benchmark datasets such as GTEA and 50Salads. Multiple ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of semantic features in enhancing model performance. Notably, the inclusion of semantic edges in Semantic2Graph allows for the cost-effective capture of long-term dependencies, affirming its utility in addressing the challenges posed by computational resource constraints in video-based vision models."
2209.05824,CPnP: Consistent Pose Estimator for Perspective-n-Point Problem with   Bias Elimination,"The Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem has been widely studied in both computer vision and photogrammetry societies. With the development of feature extraction techniques, a large number of feature points might be available in a single shot. It is promising to devise a consistent estimator, i.e., the estimate can converge to the true camera pose as the number of points increases. To this end, we propose a consistent PnP solver, named \emph{CPnP}, with bias elimination. Specifically, linear equations are constructed from the original projection model via measurement model modification and variable elimination, based on which a closed-form least-squares solution is obtained. We then analyze and subtract the asymptotic bias of this solution, resulting in a consistent estimate. Additionally, Gauss-Newton (GN) iterations are executed to refine the consistent solution. Our proposed estimator is efficient in terms of computations -- it has $O(n)$ computational complexity. Experimental tests on both synthetic data and real images show that our proposed estimator is superior to some well-known ones for images with dense visual features, in terms of estimation precision and computing time."
2209.05946,OmDet: Large-scale vision-language multi-dataset pre-training with   multimodal detection network,"The advancement of object detection (OD) in open-vocabulary and open-world scenarios is a critical challenge in computer vision. This work introduces OmDet, a novel language-aware object detection architecture, and an innovative training mechanism that harnesses continual learning and multi-dataset vision-language pre-training. Leveraging natural language as a universal knowledge representation, OmDet accumulates a ""visual vocabulary"" from diverse datasets, unifying the task as a language-conditioned detection framework. Our multimodal detection network (MDN) overcomes the challenges of multi-dataset joint training and generalizes to numerous training datasets without manual label taxonomy merging. We demonstrate superior performance of OmDet over strong baselines in object detection in the wild, open-vocabulary detection, and phrase grounding, achieving state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies reveal the impact of scaling the pre-training visual vocabulary, indicating a promising direction for further expansion to larger datasets. The effectiveness of our deep fusion approach is underscored by its ability to learn jointly from multiple datasets, enhancing performance through knowledge sharing."
2209.05954,Automatically Score Tissue Images Like a Pathologist by Transfer   Learning,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world. Diagnosing cancer early on can save many lives. Pathologists have to look at tissue microarray (TMA) images manually to identify tumors, which can be time-consuming, inconsistent and subjective. Existing automatic algorithms either have not achieved the accuracy level of a pathologist or require substantial human involvements. A major challenge is that TMA images with different shapes, sizes, and locations can have the same score. Learning staining patterns in TMA images requires a huge number of images, which are severely limited due to privacy and regulation concerns in medical organizations. TMA images from different cancer types may share certain common characteristics, but combining them directly harms the accuracy due to heterogeneity in their staining patterns. Transfer learning is an emerging learning paradigm that allows borrowing strength from similar problems. However, existing approaches typically require a large sample from similar learning problems, while TMA images of different cancer types are often available in small sample size and further existing algorithms are limited to transfer learning from one similar problem. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm that could learn from multiple related problems, where each problem has a small sample and can have a substantially different distribution from the original one. The proposed algorithm has made it possible to break the critical accuracy barrier (the 75% accuracy level of pathologists), with a reported accuracy of 75.9% on breast cancer TMA images from the Stanford Tissue Microarray Database. It is supported by recent developments in transfer learning theory and empirical evidence in clustering technology. This will allow pathologists to confidently adopt automatic algorithms in recognizing tumors consistently with a higher accuracy in real time."
2209.06119,"APTx: better activation function than MISH, SWISH, and ReLU's variants   used in deep learning","Activation Functions introduce non-linearity in the deep neural networks. This nonlinearity helps the neural networks learn faster and efficiently from the dataset. In deep learning, many activation functions are developed and used based on the type of problem statement. ReLU's variants, SWISH, and MISH are goto activation functions. MISH function is considered having similar or even better performance than SWISH, and much better than ReLU. In this paper, we propose an activation function named APTx which behaves similar to MISH, but requires lesser mathematical operations to compute. The lesser computational requirements of APTx does speed up the model training, and thus also reduces the hardware requirement for the deep learning model.

2209.06314,Placing Human Animations into 3D Scenes by Learning Interaction- and   Geometry-Driven Keyframes,"We present a novel method for placing a 3D human animation into a 3D scene while maintaining any human-scene interactions in the animation. We use the notion of computing the most important meshes in the animation for the interaction with the scene, which we call ""keyframes."" These keyframes allow us to better optimize the placement of the animation into the scene such that interactions in the animations (standing, laying, sitting, etc.) match the affordances of the scene (e.g., standing on the floor or laying in a bed). We compare our method, which we call PAAK, with prior approaches, including POSA, PROX ground truth, and a motion synthesis method, and highlight the benefits of our method with a perceptual study. Human raters preferred our PAAK method over the PROX ground truth data 64.6\% of the time. Additionally, in direct comparisons, the raters preferred PAAK over competing methods including 61.5\% compared to POSA."
2209.06428,Semantic Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: A Survey,"Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) has achieved great progress in the computer vision and robotics communities, and has been successfully used in many fields such as autonomous robot navigation and AR/VR. However, vSLAM cannot achieve good localization in dynamic and complex environments. Numerous publications have reported that, by combining with the semantic information with vSLAM, the semantic vSLAM systems have the capability of solving the above problems in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive survey about semantic vSLAM. To fill the gap, this paper first reviews the development of semantic vSLAM, explicitly focusing on its strengths and differences. Secondly, we explore three main issues of semantic vSLAM: the extraction and association of semantic information, the application of semantic information, and the advantages of semantic vSLAM. Then, we collect and analyze the current state-of-the-art SLAM datasets which have been widely used in semantic vSLAM systems. Finally, we discuss future directions that will provide a blueprint for the future development of semantic vSLAM."
2209.06950,Lossy Image Compression with Conditional Diffusion Models,"This paper outlines an end-to-end optimized lossy image compression framework using diffusion generative models. The approach relies on the transform coding paradigm, where an image is mapped into a latent space for entropy coding and, from there, mapped back to the data space for reconstruction. In contrast to VAE-based neural compression, where the (mean) decoder is a deterministic neural network, our decoder is a conditional diffusion model. Our approach thus introduces an additional ``content'' latent variable on which the reverse diffusion process is conditioned and uses this variable to store information about the image. The remaining ``texture'' variables characterizing the diffusion process are synthesized at decoding time. We show that the model's performance can be tuned toward perceptual metrics of interest. Our extensive experiments involving multiple datasets and image quality assessment metrics show that our approach yields stronger reported FID scores than the GAN-based model, while also yielding competitive performance with VAE-based models in several distortion metrics. Furthermore, training the diffusion with $\mathcal{X}$-parameterization enables high-quality reconstructions in only a handful of decoding steps, greatly affecting the model's practicality. Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/buggyyang/CDC_compression}"
2209.07042,"Efficient Perception, Planning, and Control Algorithm for Vision-Based   Automated Vehicles","Autonomous vehicles have limited computational resources and thus require efficient control systems. The cost and size of sensors have limited the development of self-driving cars. To overcome these restrictions, this study proposes an efficient framework for the operation of vision-based automatic vehicles; the framework requires only a monocular camera and a few inexpensive radars. The proposed algorithm comprises a multi-task UNet (MTUNet) network for extracting image features and constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (CILQR) and vision predictive control (VPC) modules for rapid motion planning and control. MTUNet is designed to simultaneously solve lane line segmentation, the ego vehicle's heading angle regression, road type classification, and traffic object detection tasks at approximately 40 FPS for 228 x 228 pixel RGB input images. The CILQR controllers then use the MTUNet outputs and radar data as inputs to produce driving commands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle guidance within only 1 ms. In particular, the VPC algorithm is included to reduce steering command latency to below actuator latency, preventing performance degradation during tight turns. The VPC algorithm uses road curvature data from MTUNet to estimate the appropriate correction for the current steering angle at a look-ahead point to adjust the turning amount. The inclusion of the VPC algorithm in a VPC-CILQR controller leads to higher performance on curvy roads than the use of CILQR alone. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autonomous driving system, which does not require high-definition maps, can be applied in current autonomous vehicles."
2209.07105,Bridging Implicit and Explicit Geometric Transformation for Single-Image   View Synthesis,"Creating novel views from a single image has achieved tremendous strides with advanced autoregressive models, as unseen regions have to be inferred from the visible scene contents. Although recent methods generate high-quality novel views, synthesizing with only one explicit or implicit 3D geometry has a trade-off between two objectives that we call the ""seesaw"" problem: 1) preserving reprojected contents and 2) completing realistic out-of-view regions. Also, autoregressive models require a considerable computational cost. In this paper, we propose a single-image view synthesis framework for mitigating the seesaw problem while utilizing an efficient non-autoregressive model. Motivated by the characteristics that explicit methods well preserve reprojected pixels and implicit methods complete realistic out-of-view regions, we introduce a loss function to complement two renderers. Our loss function promotes that explicit features improve the reprojected area of implicit features and implicit features improve the out-of-view area of explicit features. With the proposed architecture and loss function, we can alleviate the seesaw problem, outperforming autoregressive-based state-of-the-art methods and generating an image $\approx$100 times faster. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method with experiments on RealEstate10K and ACID datasets."
2209.07163,Morphology-Aware Interactive Keypoint Estimation,"Diagnosis based on medical images, such as X-ray images, often involves manual annotation of anatomical keypoints. However, this process involves significant human efforts and can thus be a bottleneck in the diagnostic process. To fully automate this procedure, deep-learning-based methods have been widely proposed and have achieved high performance in detecting keypoints in medical images. However, these methods still have clinical limitations: accuracy cannot be guaranteed for all cases, and it is necessary for doctors to double-check all predictions of models. In response, we propose a novel deep neural network that, given an X-ray image, automatically detects and refines the anatomical keypoints through a user-interactive system in which doctors can fix mispredicted keypoints with fewer clicks than needed during manual revision. Using our own collected data and the publicly available AASCE dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the annotation costs via extensive quantitative and qualitative results. A demo video of our approach is available on our project webpage."
2209.07193,Rethinking the Unpretentious U-net for Medical Ultrasound Image   Segmentation,"Breast tumor segmentation is one of the key steps that helps us characterize and localize tumor regions. However, variable tumor morphology, blurred boundary, and similar intensity distributions bring challenges for accurate segmentation of breast tumors. Recently, many U-net variants have been proposed and widely used for breast tumors segmentation. However, these architectures suffer from two limitations: (1) Ignoring the characterize ability of the benchmark networks, and (2) Introducing extra complex operations increases the difficulty of understanding and reproducing the network. To alleviate these challenges, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful nested U-net (NU-net) for accurate segmentation of breast tumors. The key idea is to utilize U-Nets with different depths and shared weights to achieve robust characterization of breast tumors. NU-net mainly has the following advantages: (1) Improving network adaptability and robustness to breast tumors with different scales, (2) This method is easy to reproduce and execute, and (3) The extra operations increase network parameters without significantly increasing computational cost. Extensive experimental results with twelve state-of-the-art segmentation methods on three public breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that NU-net has more competitive segmentation performance on breast tumors. Furthermore, the robustness of NU-net is further illustrated on the segmentation of renal ultrasound images. The source code is publicly available on https://github.com/CGPzy/NU-net."
2209.07341,Does CLIP Know My Face?,"With the rise of deep learning in various applications, privacy concerns around the protection of training data have become a critical area of research. Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws."
2209.08176,OysterNet: Enhanced Oyster Detection Using Simulation,"Oysters play a pivotal role in the bay living ecosystem and are considered the living filters for the ocean. In recent years, oyster reefs have undergone major devastation caused by commercial over-harvesting, requiring preservation to maintain ecological balance. The foundation of this preservation is to estimate the oyster density which requires accurate oyster detection. However, systems for accurate oyster detection require large datasets obtaining which is an expensive and labor-intensive task in underwater environments. To this end, we present a novel method to mathematically model oysters and render images of oysters in simulation to boost the detection performance with minimal real data. Utilizing our synthetic data along with real data for oyster detection, we obtain up to 35.1% boost in performance as compared to using only real data with our OysterNet network. We also improve the state-of-the-art by 12.7%. This shows that using underlying geometrical properties of objects can help to enhance recognition task accuracy on limited datasets successfully and we hope more researchers adopt such a strategy for hard-to-obtain datasets."
2209.08199,ScreenQA: Large-Scale Question-Answer Pairs over Mobile App Screenshots,"We introduce ScreenQA, a novel benchmarking dataset designed to advance screen content understanding through question answering. The existing screen datasets are focused either on low-level structural and component understanding, or on a much higher-level composite task such as navigation and task completion for autonomous agents. ScreenQA attempts to bridge this gap. By annotating 86k question-answer pairs over the RICO dataset, we aim to benchmark the screen reading comprehension capacity, thereby laying the foundation for vision-based automation over screenshots. Our annotations encompass full answers, short answer phrases, and corresponding UI contents with bounding boxes, enabling four subtasks to address various application scenarios. We evaluate the dataset's efficacy using both open-weight and proprietary models in zero-shot, fine-tuned, and transfer learning settings. We further demonstrate positive transfer to web applications, highlighting its potential beyond mobile applications."
2209.08417,Spatial-Temporal Deep Embedding for Vehicle Trajectory Reconstruction   from High-Angle Video,"Spatial-temporal Map (STMap)-based methods have shown great potential to process high-angle videos for vehicle trajectory reconstruction, which can meet the needs of various data-driven modeling and imitation learning applications. In this paper, we developed Spatial-Temporal Deep Embedding (STDE) model that imposes parity constraints at both pixel and instance levels to generate instance-aware embeddings for vehicle stripe segmentation on STMap. At pixel level, each pixel was encoded with its 8-neighbor pixels at different ranges, and this encoding is subsequently used to guide a neural network to learn the embedding mechanism. At the instance level, a discriminative loss function is designed to pull pixels belonging to the same instance closer and separate the mean value of different instances far apart in the embedding space. The output of the spatial-temporal affinity is then optimized by the mutex-watershed algorithm to obtain final clustering results. Based on segmentation metrics, our model outperformed five other baselines that have been used for STMap processing and shows robustness under the influence of shadows, static noises, and overlapping. The designed model is applied to process all public NGSIM US-101 videos to generate complete vehicle trajectories, indicating a good scalability and adaptability. Last but not least, the strengths of the scanline method with STDE and future directions were discussed. Code, STMap dataset and video trajectory are made publicly available in the online repository.

2209.08614,Deep Adaptation of Adult-Child Facial Expressions by Fusing Landmark   Features,"Imaging of facial affects may be used to measure psychophysiological attributes of children through their adulthood for applications in education, healthcare, and entertainment, among others. Deep convolutional neural networks show promising results in classifying facial expressions of adults. However, classifier models trained with adult benchmark data are unsuitable for learning child expressions due to discrepancies in psychophysical development. Similarly, models trained with child data perform poorly in adult expression classification. We propose domain adaptation to concurrently align distributions of adult and child expressions in a shared latent space for robust classification of either domain. Furthermore, age variations in facial images are studied in age-invariant face recognition yet remain unleveraged in adult-child expression classification. We take inspiration from multiple fields and propose deep adaptive FACial Expressions fusing BEtaMix SElected Landmark Features (FACE-BE-SELF) for adult-child expression classification. For the first time in the literature, a mixture of Beta distributions is used to decompose and select facial features based on correlations with expression, domain, and identity factors. We evaluate FACE-BE-SELF using 5-fold cross validation for two pairs of adult-child data sets. Our proposed FACE-BE-SELF approach outperforms transfer learning and other baseline domain adaptation methods in aligning latent representations of adult and child expressions."
2209.08747,On Robust Cross-View Consistency in Self-Supervised Monocular Depth   Estimation,"Remarkable progress has been made in self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) by exploring cross-view consistency, e.g., photometric consistency and 3D point cloud consistency. However, they are very vulnerable to illumination variance, occlusions, texture-less regions, as well as moving objects, making them not robust enough to deal with various scenes. To address this challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this paper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by reconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment, which is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature Alignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and its nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the point density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density Alignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both depth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the ""point-to-point"" alignment paradigm to the ""region-to-region"" one. Compared with the photometric consistency loss as well as the rigid point cloud alignment loss, the proposed DFA and VDA losses are more robust owing to the strong representation power of deep features as well as the high tolerance of voxel density to the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results on several outdoor benchmarks show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive ablation study and analysis validate the effectiveness of the proposed losses, especially in challenging scenes. The code and models are available at https://github.com/sunnyHelen/RCVC-depth."
2209.08763,Decentralized Vehicle Coordination: The Berkeley DeepDrive Drone Dataset   and Consensus-Based Models,"A significant portion of roads, particularly in densely populated developing countries, lacks explicitly defined right-of-way rules. These understructured roads pose substantial challenges for autonomous vehicle motion planning, where efficient and safe navigation relies on understanding decentralized human coordination for collision avoidance. This coordination, often termed ""social driving etiquette,"" remains underexplored due to limited open-source empirical data and suitable modeling frameworks. In this paper, we present a novel dataset and modeling framework designed to study motion planning in these understructured environments. The dataset includes 20 aerial videos of representative scenarios, an image dataset for training vehicle detection models, and a development kit for vehicle trajectory estimation. We demonstrate that a consensus-based modeling approach can effectively explain the emergence of priority orders observed in our dataset, and is therefore a viable framework for decentralized collision avoidance planning."
2209.08891,Exploiting Cultural Biases via Homoglyphs in Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Models for text-to-image synthesis, such as DALL-E~2 and Stable Diffusion, have recently drawn a lot of interest from academia and the general public. These models are capable of producing high-quality images that depict a variety of concepts and styles when conditioned on textual descriptions. However, these models adopt cultural characteristics associated with specific Unicode scripts from their vast amount of training data, which may not be immediately apparent. We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in a textual description, common models reflect cultural stereotypes and biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identify a model's text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Additionally, malicious users or service providers may try to intentionally bias the image generation to create racist stereotypes by replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we propose a novel homoglyph unlearning method to fine-tune a text encoder, making it robust against homoglyph manipulations."
2209.08996,EDO-Net: Learning Elastic Properties of Deformable Objects from Graph   Dynamics,"We study the problem of learning graph dynamics of deformable objects that generalizes to unknown physical properties. Our key insight is to leverage a latent representation of elastic physical properties of cloth-like deformable objects that can be extracted, for example, from a pulling interaction. In this paper we propose EDO-Net (Elastic Deformable Object - Net), a model of graph dynamics trained on a large variety of samples with different elastic properties that does not rely on ground-truth labels of the properties. EDO-Net jointly learns an adaptation module, and a forward-dynamics module. The former is responsible for extracting a latent representation of the physical properties of the object, while the latter leverages the latent representation to predict future states of cloth-like objects represented as graphs. We evaluate EDO-Net both in simulation and real world, assessing its capabilities of: 1) generalizing to unknown physical properties, 2) transferring the learned representation to new downstream tasks."
2209.09178,ViT-DD: Multi-Task Vision Transformer for Semi-Supervised Driver   Distraction Detection,"Ensuring traffic safety and mitigating accidents in modern driving is of paramount importance, and computer vision technologies have the potential to significantly contribute to this goal. This paper presents a multi-modal Vision Transformer for Driver Distraction Detection (termed ViT-DD), which incorporates inductive information from training signals related to both distraction detection and driver emotion recognition. Additionally, a self-learning algorithm is developed, allowing for the seamless integration of driver data without emotion labels into the multi-task training process of ViT-DD. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ViT-DD surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods for driver distraction detection by 6.5% and 0.9% on the SFDDD and AUCDD datasets, respectively."
2209.09194,Differentiable Frequency-based Disentanglement for Aerial Video Action   Recognition,"We present a learning algorithm for human activity recognition in videos. Our approach is designed for UAV videos, which are mainly acquired from obliquely placed dynamic cameras that contain a human actor along with background motion. Typically, the human actors occupy less than one-tenth of the spatial resolution. Our approach simultaneously harnesses the benefits of frequency domain representations, a classical analysis tool in signal processing, and data driven neural networks. We build a differentiable static-dynamic frequency mask prior to model the salient static and dynamic pixels in the video, crucial for the underlying task of action recognition. We use this differentiable mask prior to enable the neural network to intrinsically learn disentangled feature representations via an identity loss function. Our formulation empowers the network to inherently compute disentangled salient features within its layers. Further, we propose a cost-function encapsulating temporal relevance and spatial content to sample the most important frame within uniformly spaced video segments. We conduct extensive experiments on the UAV Human dataset and the NEC Drone dataset and demonstrate relative improvements of 5.72% - 13.00% over the state-of-the-art and 14.28% - 38.05% over the corresponding baseline model."
2209.09616,Provably Uncertainty-Guided Universal Domain Adaptation,"Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer the knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without any assumptions of the label sets, which requires distinguishing the unknown samples from the known ones in the target domain. A main challenge of UniDA is that the nonidentical label sets cause the misalignment between the two domains. Moreover, the domain discrepancy and the supervised objectives in the source domain easily lead the whole model to be biased towards the common classes and produce overconfident predictions for unknown samples. To address the above challenging problems, we propose a new uncertainty-guided UniDA framework. Firstly, we introduce an empirical estimation of the probability of a target sample belonging to the unknown class which fully exploits the distribution of the target samples in the latent space. Then, based on the estimation, we propose a novel neighbors searching scheme in a linear subspace with a $\delta$-filter to estimate the uncertainty score of a target sample and discover unknown samples. It fully utilizes the relationship between a target sample and its neighbors in the source domain to avoid the influence of domain misalignment. Secondly, this paper well balances the confidences of predictions for both known and unknown samples through an uncertainty-guided margin loss based on the confidences of discovered unknown samples, which can reduce the gap between the intra-class variances of known classes with respect to the unknown class. Finally, experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
2209.09641,Calibrating Segmentation Networks with Margin-based Label Smoothing,"Despite the undeniable progress in visual recognition tasks fueled by deep neural networks, there exists recent evidence showing that these models are poorly calibrated, resulting in over-confident predictions. The standard practices of minimizing the cross entropy loss during training promote the predicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments. Nevertheless, this yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is significantly larger than the remaining activations, which exacerbates the miscalibration problem. Recent observations from the classification literature suggest that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the entropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. Despite these findings, the impact of these losses in the relevant task of calibrating medical image segmentation networks remains unexplored. In this work, we provide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current state-of-the-art calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed as approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian term) imposing equality constraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such underlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push towards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best compromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model during gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a simple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which imposes a controllable margin on logit distances. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of public medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method sets novel state-of-the-art results on these tasks in terms of network calibration, whereas the discriminative performance is also improved."
2209.09841,Exploring Inconsistent Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection with   Data Augmentation,"Knowledge Distillation (KD) for object detection aims to train a compact detector by transferring knowledge from a teacher model. Since the teacher model perceives data in a way different from humans, existing KD methods only distill knowledge that is consistent with labels annotated by human expert while neglecting knowledge that is not consistent with human perception, which results in insufficient distillation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose inconsistent knowledge distillation (IKD), which aims to distill knowledge inherent in the teacher model's counter-intuitive perceptions. We start by considering the teacher model's counter-intuitive perceptions of frequency and non-robust features. Unlike previous works that exploit fine-grained features or introduce additional regularizations, we extract inconsistent knowledge by providing diverse input using data augmentation. Specifically, we propose a sample-specific data augmentation to transfer the teacher model's ability in capturing distinct frequency components and suggest an adversarial feature augmentation to extract the teacher model's perceptions of non-robust features in the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines on one-stage, two-stage and anchor-free object detectors (at most +1.0 mAP). Our codes will be made available at \url{https://github.com/JWLiang007/IKD.git}."
2209.09930,Deep Superpixel Generation and Clustering for Weakly Supervised   Segmentation of Brain Tumors in MR Images,"Training machine learning models to segment tumors and other anomalies in medical images is an important step for developing diagnostic tools but generally requires manually annotated ground truth segmentations, which necessitates significant time and resources. This work proposes the use of a superpixel generation model and a superpixel clustering model to enable weakly supervised brain tumor segmentations. The proposed method utilizes binary image-level classification labels, which are readily accessible, to significantly improve the initial region of interest segmentations generated by standard weakly supervised methods without requiring ground truth annotations. We used 2D slices of magnetic resonance brain scans from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020 dataset and labels indicating the presence of tumors to train the pipeline. On the test cohort, our method achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.691 and a mean 95% Hausdorff distance of 18.1, outperforming existing superpixel-based weakly supervised segmentation methods."
2209.09943,Adversarial Bi-Regressor Network for Domain Adaptive Regression,"Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer the knowledge of a well-labeled source domain to facilitate unlabeled target learning. When turning to specific tasks such as indoor (Wi-Fi) localization, it is essential to learn a cross-domain regressor to mitigate the domain shift. This paper proposes a novel method Adversarial Bi-Regressor Network (ABRNet) to seek more effective cross-domain regression model. Specifically, a discrepant bi-regressor architecture is developed to maximize the difference of bi-regressor to discover uncertain target instances far from the source distribution, and then an adversarial training mechanism is adopted between feature extractor and dual regressors to produce domain-invariant representations. To further bridge the large domain gap, a domain-specific augmentation module is designed to synthesize two source-similar and target-similar intermediate domains to gradually eliminate the original domain mismatch. The empirical studies on two cross-domain regressive benchmarks illustrate the power of our method on solving the domain adaptive regression (DAR) problem."
2209.10020,Towards 3D VR-Sketch to 3D Shape Retrieval,"Growing free online 3D shapes collections dictated research on 3D retrieval. Active debate has however been had on (i) what the best input modality is to trigger retrieval, and (ii) the ultimate usage scenario for such retrieval. In this paper, we offer a different perspective towards answering these questions -- we study the use of 3D sketches as an input modality and advocate a VR-scenario where retrieval is conducted. Thus, the ultimate vision is that users can freely retrieve a 3D model by air-doodling in a VR environment. As a first stab at this new 3D VR-sketch to 3D shape retrieval problem, we make four contributions. First, we code a VR utility to collect 3D VR-sketches and conduct retrieval. Second, we collect the first set of $167$ 3D VR-sketches on two shape categories from ModelNet. Third, we propose a novel approach to generate a synthetic dataset of human-like 3D sketches of different abstract levels to train deep networks. At last, we compare the common multi-view and volumetric approaches: We show that, in contrast to 3D shape to 3D shape retrieval, volumetric point-based approaches exhibit superior performance on 3D sketch to 3D shape retrieval due to the sparse and abstract nature of 3D VR-sketches. We believe these contributions will collectively serve as enablers for future attempts at this problem. The VR interface, code and datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/3DSketch3DV."
2209.10134,Recipe Generation from Unsegmented Cooking Videos,"This paper tackles recipe generation from unsegmented cooking videos, a task that requires agents to (1) extract key events in completing the dish and (2) generate sentences for the extracted events. Our task is similar to dense video captioning (DVC), which aims at detecting events thoroughly and generating sentences for them. However, unlike DVC, in recipe generation, recipe story awareness is crucial, and a model should extract an appropriate number of events in the correct order and generate accurate sentences based on them. We analyze the output of the DVC model and confirm that although (1) several events are adoptable as a recipe story, (2) the generated sentences for such events are not grounded in the visual content. Based on this, we set our goal to obtain correct recipes by selecting oracle events from the output events and re-generating sentences for them. To achieve this, we propose a transformer-based multimodal recurrent approach of training an event selector and sentence generator for selecting oracle events from the DVC's events and generating sentences for them. In addition, we extend the model by including ingredients to generate more accurate recipes. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DVC models. We also confirm that, by modeling the recipe in a story-aware manner, the proposed model outputs the appropriate number of events in the correct order."
2209.10192,Multi-Field De-interlacing using Deformable Convolution Residual Blocks   and Self-Attention,"Although deep learning has made significant impact on image/video restoration and super-resolution, learned deinterlacing has so far received less attention in academia or industry. This is despite deinterlacing is well-suited for supervised learning from synthetic data since the degradation model is known and fixed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-field full frame-rate deinterlacing network, which adapts the state-of-the-art superresolution approaches to the deinterlacing task. Our model aligns features from adjacent fields to a reference field (to be deinterlaced) using both deformable convolution residual blocks and self attention. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides state-of-the-art deinterlacing results in terms of both numerical and perceptual performance. At the time of writing, our model ranks first in the Full FrameRate LeaderBoard at https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/deinterlacer.html"
2209.10368,USC: Uncompromising Spatial Constraints for Safety-Oriented 3D Object   Detectors in Autonomous Driving,"In this work, we consider the safety-oriented performance of 3D object detectors in autonomous driving contexts. Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety."
2209.10837,A Spatial-channel-temporal-fused Attention for Spiking Neural Networks,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) mimic brain computational strategies, and exhibit substantial capabilities in spatiotemporal information processing. As an essential factor for human perception, visual attention refers to the dynamic process for selecting salient regions in biological vision systems. Although visual attention mechanisms have achieved great success in computer vision applications, they are rarely introduced into SNNs. Inspired by experimental observations on predictive attentional remapping, we propose a new spatial-channel-temporal-fused attention (SCTFA) module that can guide SNNs to efficiently capture underlying target regions by utilizing accumulated historical spatial-channel information in the present study. Through a systematic evaluation on three event stream datasets (DVS Gesture, SL-Animals-DVS and MNIST-DVS), we demonstrate that the SNN with the SCTFA module (SCTFA-SNN) not only significantly outperforms the baseline SNN (BL-SNN) and two other SNN models with degenerated attention modules, but also achieves competitive accuracy with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our detailed analysis shows that the proposed SCTFA-SNN model has strong robustness to noise and outstanding stability when faced with incomplete data, while maintaining acceptable complexity and efficiency. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating appropriate cognitive mechanisms of the brain may provide a promising approach to elevate the capabilities of SNNs."
2209.10907,DRKF: Distilled Rotated Kernel Fusion for Efficient Rotation Invariant   Descriptors in Local Feature Matching,"The performance of local feature descriptors degrades in the presence of large rotation variations. To address this issue, we present an efficient approach to learning rotation invariant descriptors. Specifically, we propose Rotated Kernel Fusion (RKF) which imposes rotations on the convolution kernel to improve the inherent nature of CNN. Since RKF can be processed by the subsequent re-parameterization, no extra computational costs will be introduced in the inference stage. Moreover, we present Multi-oriented Feature Aggregation (MOFA) which aggregates features extracted from multiple rotated versions of the input image and can provide auxiliary knowledge for the training of RKF by leveraging the distillation strategy. We refer to the distilled RKF model as DRKF. Besides the evaluation on a rotation-augmented version of the public dataset HPatches, we also contribute a new dataset named DiverseBEV which is collected during the drone's flight and consists of bird's eye view images with large viewpoint changes and camera rotations. Extensive experiments show that our method can outperform other state-of-the-art techniques when exposed to large rotation variations."
2209.11200,Attention is All They Need: Exploring the Media Archaeology of the   Computer Vision Research Paper,"Research papers, in addition to textual documents, are a designed interface through which researchers communicate. Recently, rapid growth has transformed that interface in many fields of computing. In this work, we examine the effects of this growth from a media archaeology perspective, through the changes to figures and tables in research papers. Specifically, we study these changes in computer vision over the past decade, as the deep learning revolution has driven unprecedented growth in the discipline. We ground our investigation through interviews with veteran researchers spanning computer vision, graphics, and visualization. Our analysis focuses on the research attention economy: how research paper elements contribute towards advertising, measuring, and disseminating an increasingly commodified ""contribution."" Through this work, we seek to motivate future discussion surrounding the design of both the research paper itself as well as the larger sociotechnical research publishing system, including tools for finding, reading, and writing research papers."
2209.11359,CUTS: A Deep Learning and Topological Framework for Multigranular   Unsupervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Segmenting medical images is critical to facilitating both patient diagnoses and quantitative research. A major limiting factor is the lack of labeled data, as obtaining expert annotations for each new set of imaging data and task can be labor intensive and inconsistent among annotators. We present CUTS, an unsupervised deep learning framework for medical image segmentation. CUTS operates in two stages. For each image, it produces an embedding map via intra-image contrastive learning and local patch reconstruction. Then, these embeddings are partitioned at dynamic granularity levels that correspond to the data topology. CUTS yields a series of coarse-to-fine-grained segmentations that highlight features at various granularities. We applied CUTS to retinal fundus images and two types of brain MRI images to delineate structures and patterns at different scales. When evaluated against predefined anatomical masks, CUTS improved the dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance by at least 10% compared to existing unsupervised methods. Finally, CUTS showed performance on par with Segment Anything Models (SAM, MedSAM, SAM-Med2D) pre-trained on gigantic labeled datasets."
2209.11436,Understanding Open-Set Recognition by Jacobian Norm and Inter-Class   Separation,"The findings on open-set recognition (OSR) show that models trained on classification datasets are capable of detecting unknown classes not encountered during the training process. Specifically, after training, the learned representations of known classes dissociate from the representations of the unknown class, facilitating OSR. In this paper, we investigate this emergent phenomenon by examining the relationship between the Jacobian norm of representations and the inter/intra-class learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that intra-class learning reduces the Jacobian norm for known class samples, while inter-class learning increases the Jacobian norm for unknown samples, even in the absence of direct exposure to any unknown sample. Overall, the discrepancy in the Jacobian norm between the known and unknown classes enables OSR. Based on this insight, which highlights the pivotal role of inter-class learning, we devise a marginal one-vs-rest (m-OvR) loss function that promotes strong inter-class separation. To further improve OSR performance, we integrate the m-OvR loss with additional strategies that maximize the Jacobian norm disparity. We present comprehensive experimental results that support our theoretical observations and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed OSR approach."
2209.11737,Visual representations in the human brain are aligned with large   language models,"The human brain extracts complex information from visual inputs, including objects, their spatial and semantic interrelations, and their interactions with the environment. However, a quantitative approach for studying this information remains elusive. Here, we test whether the contextual information encoded in large language models (LLMs) is beneficial for modelling the complex visual information extracted by the brain from natural scenes. We show that LLM embeddings of scene captions successfully characterise brain activity evoked by viewing the natural scenes. This mapping captures selectivities of different brain areas, and is sufficiently robust that accurate scene captions can be reconstructed from brain activity. Using carefully controlled model comparisons, we then proceed to show that the accuracy with which LLM representations match brain representations derives from the ability of LLMs to integrate complex information contained in scene captions beyond that conveyed by individual words. Finally, we train deep neural network models to transform image inputs into LLM representations. Remarkably, these networks learn representations that are better aligned with brain representations than a large number of state-of-the-art alternative models, despite being trained on orders-of-magnitude less data. Overall, our results suggest that LLM embeddings of scene captions provide a representational format that accounts for complex information extracted by the brain from visual inputs."
2209.11740,On the Shift Invariance of Max Pooling Feature Maps in Convolutional   Neural Networks,"This paper focuses on improving the mathematical interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification. Specifically, we tackle the instability issue arising in their first layer, which tends to learn parameters that closely resemble oriented band-pass filters when trained on datasets like ImageNet. Subsampled convolutions with such Gabor-like filters are prone to aliasing, causing sensitivity to small input shifts. In this context, we establish conditions under which the max pooling operator approximates a complex modulus, which is nearly shift invariant. We then derive a measure of shift invariance for subsampled convolutions followed by max pooling. In particular, we highlight the crucial role played by the filter's frequency and orientation in achieving stability. We experimentally validate our theory by considering a deterministic feature extractor based on the dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, a particular case of discrete Gabor-like decomposition."
2209.11750,Lightweight Transformers for Human Activity Recognition on Mobile   Devices,"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on mobile devices has shown to be achievable with lightweight neural models learned from data generated by the user's inertial measurement units (IMUs). Most approaches for instanced-based HAR have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), or a combination of the two to achieve state-of-the-art results with real-time performances. Recently, the Transformers architecture in the language processing domain and then in the vision domain has pushed further the state-of-the-art over classical architectures. However, such Transformers architecture is heavyweight in computing resources, which is not well suited for embedded applications of HAR that can be found in the pervasive computing domain. In this study, we present Human Activity Recognition Transformer (HART), a lightweight, sensor-wise transformer architecture that has been specifically adapted to the domain of the IMUs embedded on mobile devices. Our experiments on HAR tasks with several publicly available datasets show that HART uses fewer FLoating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) and parameters while outperforming current state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we present evaluations across various architectures on their performances in heterogeneous environments and show that our models can better generalize on different sensing devices or on-body positions."
2209.11795,Descriptor Distillation: a Teacher-Student-Regularized Framework for   Learning Local Descriptors,"Learning a fast and discriminative patch descriptor is a challenging topic in computer vision. Recently, many existing works focus on training various descriptor learning networks by minimizing a triplet loss (or its variants), which is expected to decrease the distance between each positive pair and increase the distance between each negative pair. However, such an expectation has to be lowered due to the non-perfect convergence of network optimizer to a local solution. Addressing this problem and the open computational speed problem, we propose a Descriptor Distillation framework for local descriptor learning, called DesDis, where a student model gains knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model, and it is further enhanced via a designed teacher-student regularizer. This teacher-student regularizer is to constrain the difference between the positive (also negative) pair similarity from the teacher model and that from the student model, and we theoretically prove that a more effective student model could be trained by minimizing a weighted combination of the triplet loss and this regularizer, than its teacher which is trained by minimizing the triplet loss singly. Under the proposed DesDis, many existing descriptor networks could be embedded as the teacher model, and accordingly, both equal-weight and light-weight student models could be derived, which outperform their teacher in either accuracy or speed. Experimental results on 3 public datasets demonstrate that the equal-weight student models, derived from the proposed DesDis framework by utilizing three typical descriptor learning networks as teacher models, could achieve significantly better performances than their teachers and several other comparative methods. In addition, the derived light-weight models could achieve 8 times or even faster speeds than the comparative methods under similar patch verification performances"
2209.11796,Composite Convolution: a Flexible Operator for Deep Learning on 3D Point   Clouds,"Deep neural networks require specific layers to process point clouds, as the scattered and irregular location of 3D points prevents the use of conventional convolutional filters. We introduce the composite layer, a flexible and general alternative to the existing convolutional operators that process 3D point clouds. We design our composite layer to extract and compress the spatial information from the 3D coordinates of points and then combine this with the feature vectors. Compared to mainstream point-convolutional layers such as ConvPoint and KPConv, our composite layer guarantees greater flexibility in network design and provides an additional form of regularization. To demonstrate the generality of our composite layers, we define both a convolutional composite layer and an aggregate version that combines spatial information and features in a nonlinear manner, and we use these layers to implement CompositeNets. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that, in both classification, segmentation, and anomaly detection, our CompositeNets outperform ConvPoint, which uses the same sequential architecture, and achieve similar results as KPConv, which has a deeper, residual architecture. Moreover, our CompositeNets achieve state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection on point clouds. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/sirolf-otrebla/CompositeNet}."
2209.11945,Towards Bridging the Space Domain Gap for Satellite Pose Estimation   using Event Sensing,"Deep models trained using synthetic data require domain adaptation to bridge the gap between the simulation and target environments. State-of-the-art domain adaptation methods often demand sufficient amounts of (unlabelled) data from the target domain. However, this need is difficult to fulfil when the target domain is an extreme environment, such as space. In this paper, our target problem is close proximity satellite pose estimation, where it is costly to obtain images of satellites from actual rendezvous missions. We demonstrate that event sensing offers a promising solution to generalise from the simulation to the target domain under stark illumination differences. Our main contribution is an event-based satellite pose estimation technique, trained purely on synthetic event data with basic data augmentation to improve robustness against practical (noisy) event sensors. Underpinning our method is a novel dataset with carefully calibrated ground truth, comprising of real event data obtained by emulating satellite rendezvous scenarios in the lab under drastic lighting conditions. Results on the dataset showed that our event-based satellite pose estimation method, trained only on synthetic data without adaptation, could generalise to the target domain effectively."
2209.11964,Strong Transferable Adversarial Attacks via Ensembled Asymptotically   Normal Distribution Learning,"Strong adversarial examples are crucial for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks. However, the performance of popular attacks is usually sensitive, for instance, to minor image transformations, stemming from limited information -- typically only one input example, a handful of white-box source models, and undefined defense strategies. Hence, the crafted adversarial examples are prone to overfit the source model, which hampers their transferability to unknown architectures. In this paper, we propose an approach named Multiple Asymptotically Normal Distribution Attacks (MultiANDA) which explicitly characterize adversarial perturbations from a learned distribution. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the perturbations by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality property of stochastic gradient ascent (SGA), then employ the deep ensemble strategy as an effective proxy for Bayesian marginalization in this process, aiming to estimate a mixture of Gaussians that facilitates a more thorough exploration of the potential optimization space. The approximated posterior essentially describes the stationary distribution of SGA iterations, which captures the geometric information around the local optimum. Thus, MultiANDA allows drawing an unlimited number of adversarial perturbations for each input and reliably maintains the transferability. Our proposed method outperforms ten state-of-the-art black-box attacks on deep learning models with or without defenses through extensive experiments on seven normally trained and seven defense models."
2209.12075,S^2-Transformer for Mask-Aware Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction,"Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) surges as a novel way of capturing hyperspectral images. It operates an optical encoder to compress the 3D data into a 2D measurement and adopts a software decoder for the signal reconstruction. Recently, a representative SCI set-up of coded aperture snapshot compressive imager (CASSI) with Transformer reconstruction backend remarks high-fidelity sensing performance. However, dominant spatial and spectral attention designs show limitations in hyperspectral modeling. The spatial attention values describe the inter-pixel correlation but overlook the across-spectra variation within each pixel. The spectral attention size is unscalable to the token spatial size and thus bottlenecks information allocation. Besides, CASSI entangles the spatial and spectral information into a 2D measurement, placing a barrier for information disentanglement and modeling. In addition, CASSI blocks the light with a physical binary mask, yielding the masked data loss. To tackle above challenges, we propose a spatial-spectral (S2-) Transformer implemented by a paralleled attention design and a mask-aware learning strategy. Firstly, we systematically explore pros and cons of different spatial (-spectral) attention designs, based on which we find performing both attentions in parallel well disentangles and models the blended information. Secondly, the masked pixels induce higher prediction difficulty and should be treated differently from unmasked ones. We adaptively prioritize the loss penalty attributing to the mask structure by referring to the mask-encoded prediction as an uncertainty estimator. We theoretically discuss the distinct convergence tendencies between masked/unmasked regions of the proposed learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on average, the results of the proposed method are superior over the state-of-the-art method."
2209.12101,3D Reconstruction using Structured Light from off-the-shelf components,"The coordinate measuring machine(CMM) has been the benchmark of accuracy in measuring solid objects from nearly past 50 years or more. However with the advent of 3D scanning technology, the accuracy and the density of point cloud generated has taken over. In this project we not only compare the different algorithms that can be used in a 3D scanning software, but also create our own 3D scanner from off-the-shelf components like camera and projector. Our objective has been : 1. To develop a prototype for 3D scanner to achieve a system that performs at optimal accuracy over a wide typology of objects. 2. To minimise the cost using off-the-shelf components. 3. To reach very close to the accuracy of CMM."
2209.12675,Assessing the Role of Datasets in the Generalization of Motion   Deblurring Methods to Real Images,"Successfully training end-to-end deep networks for real motion deblurring requires datasets of sharp/blurred image pairs that are realistic and diverse enough to achieve generalization to real blurred images. Obtaining such datasets remains a challenging task. In this paper, we first review the limitations of existing deblurring benchmark datasets and analyze the underlying causes for deblurring networks' lack of generalization to blurry images in the wild. Based on this analysis, we propose an efficient procedural methodology to generate sharp/blurred image pairs based on a simple yet effective model. This allows for generating virtually unlimited diverse training pairs mimicking realistic blur properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset by training existing deblurring architectures on the simulated pairs and performing cross-dataset evaluation on three standard datasets of real blurred images. When training with the proposed method, we observed superior generalization performance for the ultimate task of deblurring real motion-blurred photos of dynamic scenes."
2209.12715,Enhancing convolutional neural network generalizability via low-rank   weight approximation,"Noise is ubiquitous during image acquisition. Sufficient denoising is often an important first step for image processing. In recent decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used for image denoising. Most DNN-based image denoising methods require a large-scale dataset or focus on supervised settings, in which single/pairs of clean images or a set of noisy images are required. This poses a significant burden on the image acquisition process. Moreover, denoisers trained on datasets of limited scale may incur over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised framework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor approximation. With the proposed design, we are able to characterize our denoiser with fewer parameters and train it based on a single image, which considerably improves the model's generalizability and reduces the cost of data acquisition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images have been conducted. Empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing non-learning-based methods (e.g., low-pass filter, non-local mean), single-image unsupervised denoisers (e.g., DIP, NN+BM3D) evaluated on both in-sample and out-sample datasets. The proposed method even achieves comparable performances with some supervised methods (e.g., DnCNN)."
2209.12881,Performance Evaluation of 3D Keypoint Detectors and Descriptors on   Coloured Point Clouds in Subsea Environments,"The recent development of high-precision subsea optical scanners allows for 3D keypoint detectors and feature descriptors to be leveraged on point cloud scans from subsea environments. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey to identify the best combination of detectors and descriptors to be used in these challenging and novel environments. This paper aims to identify the best detector/descriptor pair using a challenging field dataset collected using a commercial underwater laser scanner. Furthermore, studies have shown that incorporating texture information to extend geometric features adds robustness to feature matching on synthetic datasets. This paper also proposes a novel method of fusing images with underwater laser scans to produce coloured point clouds, which are used to study the effectiveness of 6D point cloud descriptors."
2209.13008,"USE-Evaluator: Performance Metrics for Medical Image Segmentation Models   with Uncertain, Small or Empty Reference Annotations","Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation. Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However, there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common metrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical data sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task, and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may result in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing and optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include consideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from reference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty reference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference annotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics with clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019) with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference annotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation and optimizing procedures. The evaluation code was released to encourage further analysis of this topic. https://github.com/SophieOstmeier/UncertainSmallEmpty.git"
2209.13094,Efficient Image Denoising by Low-Rank Singular Vector Approximations of   Geodesics' Gramian Matrix,"With the advent of sophisticated cameras, the urge to capture high-quality images has grown enormous. However, the noise contamination of the images results in substandard expectations among the people; thus, image denoising is an essential pre-processing step. While the algebraic image processing frameworks are sometimes inefficient for this denoising task as they may require processing of matrices of order equivalent to some power of the order of the original image, the neural network image processing frameworks are sometimes not robust as they require a lot of similar training samples. Thus, here we present a manifold-based noise filtering method that mainly exploits a few prominent singular vectors of the geodesics' Gramian matrix. Especially, the framework partitions an image, say that of size $n \times n$, into $n^2$ overlapping patches of known size such that one patch is centered at each pixel. Then, the prominent singular vectors, of the Gramian matrix of size $n^2 \times n^2$ of the geodesic distances computed over the patch space, are utilized to denoise the image. Here, the prominent singular vectors are revealed by efficient, but diverse, approximation techniques, rather than explicitly computing them using frameworks like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which encounters $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ operations. Finally, we compare both computational time and the noise filtration performance of the proposed denoising algorithm with and without singular vector approximation techniques."
2209.13131,Hitchhiker's Guide to Super-Resolution: Introduction and Recent Advances,"With the advent of Deep Learning (DL), Super-Resolution (SR) has also become a thriving research area. However, despite promising results, the field still faces challenges that require further research e.g., allowing flexible upsampling, more effective loss functions, and better evaluation metrics. We review the domain of SR in light of recent advances, and examine state-of-the-art models such as diffusion (DDPM) and transformer-based SR models. We present a critical discussion on contemporary strategies used in SR, and identify promising yet unexplored research directions. We complement previous surveys by incorporating the latest developments in the field such as uncertainty-driven losses, wavelet networks, neural architecture search, novel normalization methods, and the latests evaluation techniques. We also include several visualizations for the models and methods throughout each chapter in order to facilitate a global understanding of the trends in the field. This review is ultimately aimed at helping researchers to push the boundaries of DL applied to SR."
2209.13177,Addressing Fairness Issues in Deep Learning-Based Medical Image   Analysis: A Systematic Review,"Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various medical image analysis (MedIA) applications. However, recent research highlights a performance disparity in these algorithms when applied to specific subgroups, such as exhibiting poorer predictive performance in elderly females. Addressing this fairness issue has become a collaborative effort involving AI scientists and clinicians seeking to understand its origins and develop solutions for mitigation within MedIA. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the current advancements in addressing fairness issues in MedIA, focusing on methodological approaches. We introduce the basics of group fairness and subsequently categorize studies on fair MedIA into fairness evaluation and unfairness mitigation. Detailed methods employed in these studies are presented too. Our survey concludes with a discussion of existing challenges and opportunities in establishing a fair MedIA and healthcare system. By offering this comprehensive review, we aim to foster a shared understanding of fairness among AI researchers and clinicians, enhance the development of unfairness mitigation methods, and contribute to the creation of an equitable MedIA society."
2209.13232,A Survey on Graph Neural Networks and Graph Transformers in Computer   Vision: A Task-Oriented Perspective,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained momentum in graph representation learning and boosted the state of the art in a variety of areas, such as data mining (\emph{e.g.,} social network analysis and recommender systems), computer vision (\emph{e.g.,} object detection and point cloud learning), and natural language processing (\emph{e.g.,} relation extraction and sequence learning), to name a few. With the emergence of Transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, graph Transformers embed a graph structure into the Transformer architecture to overcome the limitations of local neighborhood aggregation while avoiding strict structural inductive biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of GNNs and graph Transformers in computer vision from a task-oriented perspective. Specifically, we divide their applications in computer vision into five categories according to the modality of input data, \emph{i.e.,} 2D natural images, videos, 3D data, vision + language, and medical images. In each category, we further divide the applications according to a set of vision tasks. Such a task-oriented taxonomy allows us to examine how each task is tackled by different GNN-based approaches and how well these approaches perform. Based on the necessary preliminaries, we provide the definitions and challenges of the tasks, in-depth coverage of the representative approaches, as well as discussions regarding insights, limitations, and future directions."
2209.13476,Mine yOur owN Anatomy: Revisiting Medical Image Segmentation with   Extremely Limited Labels,"Recent studies on contrastive learning have achieved remarkable performance solely by leveraging few labels in the context of medical image segmentation. Existing methods mainly focus on instance discrimination and invariant mapping. However, they face three common pitfalls: (1) tailness: medical image data usually follows an implicit long-tail class distribution. Blindly leveraging all pixels in training hence can lead to the data imbalance issues, and cause deteriorated performance; (2) consistency: it remains unclear whether a segmentation model has learned meaningful and yet consistent anatomical features due to the intra-class variations between different anatomical features; and (3) diversity: the intra-slice correlations within the entire dataset have received significantly less attention. This motivates us to seek a principled approach for strategically making use of the dataset itself to discover similar yet distinct samples from different anatomical views. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised 2D medical image segmentation framework termed Mine yOur owN Anatomy (MONA), and make three contributions. First, prior work argues that every pixel equally matters to the model training; we observe empirically that this alone is unlikely to define meaningful anatomical features, mainly due to lacking the supervision signal. We show two simple solutions towards learning invariances - through the use of stronger data augmentations and nearest neighbors. Second, we construct a set of objectives that encourage the model to be capable of decomposing medical images into a collection of anatomical features in an unsupervised manner. Lastly, we both empirically and theoretically, demonstrate the efficacy of our MONA on three benchmark datasets with different labeled settings, achieving new state-of-the-art under different labeled semi-supervised settings."
2209.13590,Sauron U-Net: Simple automated redundancy elimination in medical image   segmentation via filter pruning,"We introduce Sauron, a filter pruning method that eliminates redundant feature maps of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Sauron optimizes, jointly with the loss function, a regularization term that promotes feature maps clustering at each convolutional layer by reducing the distance between feature maps. Sauron then eliminates the filters corresponding to the redundant feature maps by using automatically adjusted layer-specific thresholds. Unlike most filter pruning methods, Sauron requires minimal changes to typical neural network optimization because it prunes and optimizes CNNs jointly, which, in turn, accelerates the optimization over time. Moreover, unlike with other cluster-based approaches, the user does not need to specify the number of clusters in advance, a hyperparameter that is difficult to tune. We evaluated Sauron and five state-of-the-art filter pruning methods on four medical image segmentation tasks. This is an area where little attention has been paid to filter pruning, but where smaller CNN models are desirable for local deployment, mitigating privacy concerns associated with cloud-based solutions. Sauron was the only method that achieved a reduction in model size of over 90% without deteriorating substantially the performance. Sauron also achieved, overall, the fastest models at inference time in machines with and without GPUs. Finally, we show through experiments that the feature maps of models pruned with Sauron are highly interpretable, which is essential for medical image segmentation."
2209.13696,What Does DALL-E 2 Know About Radiology?,"Generative models such as DALL-E 2 could represent a promising future tool for image generation, augmentation, and manipulation for artificial intelligence research in radiology provided that these models have sufficient medical domain knowledge. Here we show that DALL-E 2 has learned relevant representations of X-ray images with promising capabilities in terms of zero-shot text-to-image generation of new images, continuation of an image beyond its original boundaries, or removal of elements, while pathology generation or CT, MRI, and ultrasound images are still limited. The use of generative models for augmenting and generating radiological data thus seems feasible, even if further fine-tuning and adaptation of these models to the respective domain is required beforehand."
2209.13797,PCB-RandNet: Rethinking Random Sampling for LIDAR Semantic Segmentation   in Autonomous Driving Scene,"Fast and efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale LiDAR point clouds is a fundamental problem in autonomous driving. To achieve this goal, the existing point-based methods mainly choose to adopt Random Sampling strategy to process large-scale point clouds. However, our quantative and qualitative studies have found that Random Sampling may be less suitable for the autonomous driving scenario, since the LiDAR points follow an uneven or even long-tailed distribution across the space, which prevents the model from capturing sufficient information from points in different distance ranges and reduces the model's learning capability. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new Polar Cylinder Balanced Random Sampling method that enables the downsampled point clouds to maintain a more balanced distribution and improve the segmentation performance under different spatial distributions. In addition, a sampling consistency loss is introduced to further improve the segmentation performance and reduce the model's variance under different sampling methods. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach produces excellent performance on both SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS benchmarks, achieving a 2.8% and 4.0% improvement, respectively. The source code is available at https://github.com/huixiancheng/PCB-RandNet."
2209.14003,Vision based Crop Row Navigation under Varying Field Conditions in   Arable Fields,"Accurate crop row detection is often challenged by the varying field conditions present in real-world arable fields. Traditional colour based segmentation is unable to cater for all such variations. The lack of comprehensive datasets in agricultural environments limits the researchers from developing robust segmentation models to detect crop rows. We present a dataset for crop row detection with 11 field variations from Sugar Beet and Maize crops. We also present a novel crop row detection algorithm for visual servoing in crop row fields. Our algorithm can detect crop rows against varying field conditions such as curved crop rows, weed presence, discontinuities, growth stages, tramlines, shadows and light levels. Our method only uses RGB images from a front-mounted camera on a Husky robot to predict crop rows. Our method outperformed the classic colour based crop row detection baseline. Dense weed presence within inter-row space and discontinuities in crop rows were the most challenging field conditions for our crop row detection algorithm. Our method can detect the end of the crop row and navigate the robot towards the headland area when it reaches the end of the crop row."
2209.14102,Segmentation method of U-net sheet metal engineering drawing based on CBAM attention mechanism,"In the manufacturing process of heavy industrial equipment, the specific unit in the welding diagram is first manually redrawn and then the corresponding sheet metal parts are cut, which is inefficient. To this end, this paper proposes a U-net-based method for the segmentation and extraction of specific units in welding engineering drawings. This method enables the cutting device to automatically segment specific graphic units according to visual information and automatically cut out sheet metal parts of corresponding shapes according to the segmentation results. This process is more efficient than traditional human-assisted cutting. Two weaknesses in the U-net network will lead to a decrease in segmentation performance: first, the focus on global semantic feature information is weak, and second, there is a large dimensional difference between shallow encoder features and deep decoder features. Based on the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention mechanism, this paper proposes a U-net jump structure model with an attention mechanism to improve the network's global semantic feature extraction ability. In addition, a U-net attention mechanism model with dual pooling convolution fusion is designed, the deep encoder's maximum pooling + convolution features and the shallow encoder's average pooling + convolution features are fused vertically to reduce the dimension difference between the shallow encoder and deep decoder. The dual-pool convolutional attention jump structure replaces the traditional U-net jump structure, which can effectively improve the specific unit segmentation performance of the welding engineering drawing. Using vgg16 as the backbone network, experiments have verified that the IoU, mAP, and Accu of our model in the welding engineering drawing dataset segmentation task are 84.72%, 86.84%, and 99.42%, respectively."
2209.14145,Multi-scale Attention Network for Single Image Super-Resolution,"ConvNets can compete with transformers in high-level tasks by exploiting larger receptive fields. To unleash the potential of ConvNet in super-resolution, we propose a multi-scale attention network (MAN), by coupling classical multi-scale mechanism with emerging large kernel attention. In particular, we proposed multi-scale large kernel attention (MLKA) and gated spatial attention unit (GSAU). Through our MLKA, we modify large kernel attention with multi-scale and gate schemes to obtain the abundant attention map at various granularity levels, thereby aggregating global and local information and avoiding potential blocking artifacts. In GSAU, we integrate gate mechanism and spatial attention to remove the unnecessary linear layer and aggregate informative spatial context. To confirm the effectiveness of our designs, we evaluate MAN with multiple complexities by simply stacking different numbers of MLKA and GSAU. Experimental results illustrate that our MAN can perform on par with SwinIR and achieve varied trade-offs between state-of-the-art performance and computations."
2209.14272,Towards Multimodal Prediction of Spontaneous Humour: A Novel Dataset and   First Results,"Humor is a substantial element of human social behavior, affect, and cognition. Its automatic understanding can facilitate a more naturalistic human-AI interaction. Current methods of humor detection have been exclusively based on staged data, making them inadequate for ""real-world"" applications. We contribute to addressing this deficiency by introducing the novel Passau-Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) dataset, comprising about 11 hours of recordings. The Passau-SFCH dataset is annotated for the presence of humor and its dimensions (sentiment and direction) as proposed in Martin's Humor Style Questionnaire. We conduct a series of experiments employing pretrained Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and expert-designed features. The performance of each modality (text, audio, video) for spontaneous humor recognition is analyzed and their complementarity is investigated. Our findings suggest that for the automatic analysis of humor and its sentiment, facial expressions are most promising, while humor direction can be best modeled via text-based features. Further, we experiment with different multimodal approaches to humor recognition, including decision-level fusion and MulT, a multimodal Transformer approach. In this context, we propose a novel multimodal architecture that yields the best overall results. Finally, we make our code publicly available at https://www.github.com/lc0197/passau-sfch. The Passau-SFCH dataset is available upon request."
2209.14408,RALACs: Action Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles using Interaction   Encoding and Optical Flow,"When applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) settings, action recognition can enhance an environment model's situational awareness. This is especially prevalent in scenarios where traditional geometric descriptions and heuristics in AVs are insufficient. However, action recognition has traditionally been studied for humans, and its limited adaptability to noisy, un-clipped, un-pampered, raw RGB data has limited its application in other fields. To push for the advancement and adoption of action recognition into AVs, this work proposes a novel two-stage action recognition system, termed RALACs. RALACs formulates the problem of action recognition for road scenes, and bridges the gap between it and the established field of human action recognition. This work shows how attention layers can be useful for encoding the relations across agents, and stresses how such a scheme can be class-agnostic. Furthermore, to address the dynamic nature of agents on the road, RALACs constructs a novel approach to adapting Region of Interest (ROI) Alignment to agent tracks for downstream action classification. Finally, our scheme also considers the problem of active agent detection, and utilizes a novel application of fusing optical flow maps to discern relevant agents in a road scene. We show that our proposed scheme can outperform the baseline on the ICCV2021 Road Challenge dataset and by deploying it on a real vehicle platform, we provide preliminary insight to the usefulness of action recognition in decision making."
2209.14440,GeONet: a neural operator for learning the Wasserstein geodesic,"Optimal transport (OT) offers a versatile framework to compare complex data distributions in a geometrically meaningful way. Traditional methods for computing the Wasserstein distance and geodesic between probability measures require mesh-specific domain discretization and suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. We present GeONet, a mesh-invariant deep neural operator network that learns the non-linear mapping from the input pair of initial and terminal distributions to the Wasserstein geodesic connecting the two endpoint distributions. In the offline training stage, GeONet learns the saddle point optimality conditions for the dynamic formulation of the OT problem in the primal and dual spaces that are characterized by a coupled PDE system. The subsequent inference stage is instantaneous and can be deployed for real-time predictions in the online learning setting. We demonstrate that GeONet achieves comparable testing accuracy to the standard OT solvers on simulation examples and the MNIST dataset with considerably reduced inference-stage computational cost by orders of magnitude."
2209.14447,A Diver Attention Estimation Framework for Effective Underwater   Human-Robot Interaction,"Many underwater tasks, such as cable-and-wreckage inspection and search-and-rescue, can benefit from robust Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) capabilities. With the recent advancements in vision-based underwater HRI methods, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have the capability to interact with their human partners without requiring assistance from a topside operator. However, in these methods, the AUV assumes that the diver is ready for interaction, while in reality, the diver may be distracted. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem by presenting a diver attention estimation framework for AUVs to autonomously determine the attentiveness of a diver, and developing a robot controller to allow the AUV to navigate and reorient itself with respect to the diver before initiating interaction. The core element of the framework is a deep convolutional neural network called DATT-Net. It is based on a pyramid structure that can exploit the geometric relations among 10 facial keypoints of a diver to estimate their head orientation, which we use as an indicator of attentiveness. Our on-the-bench experimental evaluations and real-world experiments during both closed- and open-water robot trials confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework."
2209.14553,Regularizing Neural Network Training via Identity-wise Discriminative   Feature Suppression,"It is well-known that a deep neural network has a strong fitting capability and can easily achieve a low training error even with randomly assigned class labels. When the number of training samples is small, or the class labels are noisy, networks tend to memorize patterns specific to individual instances to minimize the training error. This leads to the issue of overfitting and poor generalisation performance. This paper explores a remedy by suppressing the network's tendency to rely on instance-specific patterns for empirical error minimisation. The proposed method is based on an adversarial training framework. It suppresses features that can be utilized to identify individual instances among samples within each class. This leads to classifiers only using features that are both discriminative across classes and common within each class. We call our method Adversarial Suppression of Identity Features (ASIF), and demonstrate the usefulness of this technique in boosting generalisation accuracy when faced with small datasets or noisy labels. Our source code is available."
2209.14624,Is Complexity Required for Neural Network Pruning? A Case Study on   Global Magnitude Pruning,"Pruning neural networks has become popular in the last decade when it was shown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural networks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been proposed since, each claiming to be better than prior art, however, at the cost of increasingly complex pruning methodologies. These methodologies include utilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or having heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. In this work, we question whether this pattern of introducing complexity is really necessary to achieve better pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against a simple pruning baseline, namely, Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP), that ranks weights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Surprisingly, we find that vanilla Global MP performs very well against the SOTA techniques. When considering sparsity-accuracy trade-off, Global MP performs better than all SOTA techniques at all sparsity ratios. When considering FLOPs-accuracy trade-off, some SOTA techniques outperform Global MP at lower sparsity ratios, however, Global MP starts performing well at high sparsity ratios and performs very well at extremely high sparsity ratios. Moreover, we find that a common issue that many pruning algorithms run into at high sparsity rates, namely, layer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP. We explore why layer collapse occurs in networks and how it can be mitigated in Global MP by utilizing a technique called Minimum Threshold. We showcase the above findings on various models (WRN-28-8, ResNet-32, ResNet-50, MobileNet-V1 and FastGRNN) and multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet and HAR-2). Code is available at https://github.com/manasgupta-1/GlobalMP."
2209.14687,Diffusion Posterior Sampling for General Noisy Inverse Problems,"Diffusion models have been recently studied as powerful generative inverse problem solvers, owing to their high quality reconstructions and the ease of combining existing iterative solvers. However, most works focus on solving simple linear inverse problems in noiseless settings, which significantly under-represents the complexity of real-world problems. In this work, we extend diffusion solvers to efficiently handle general noisy (non)linear inverse problems via approximation of the posterior sampling. Interestingly, the resulting posterior sampling scheme is a blended version of diffusion sampling with the manifold constrained gradient without a strict measurement consistency projection step, yielding a more desirable generative path in noisy settings compared to the previous studies. Our method demonstrates that diffusion models can incorporate various measurement noise statistics such as Gaussian and Poisson, and also efficiently handle noisy nonlinear inverse problems such as Fourier phase retrieval and non-uniform deblurring. Code available at https://github.com/DPS2022/diffusion-posterior-sampling"
2209.14770,R2C-GAN: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks for Blind   X-Ray Restoration and COVID-19 Classification,"Restoration of poor quality images with a blended set of artifacts plays a vital role for a reliable diagnosis. Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN."
2209.14782,A case study of spatiotemporal forecasting techniques for weather   forecasting,"The majority of real-world processes are spatiotemporal, and the data generated by them exhibits both spatial and temporal evolution. Weather is one of the most essential processes in this domain, and weather forecasting has become a crucial part of our daily routine. Weather data analysis is considered the most complex and challenging task. Although numerical weather prediction models are currently state-of-the-art, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Numerous studies have proposed time series-based models as a viable alternative to numerical forecasts. Recent research in the area of time series analysis indicates significant advancements, particularly regarding the use of state-space-based models (white box) and, more recently, the integration of machine learning and deep neural network-based models (black box). The most famous examples of such models are RNNs and transformers. These models have demonstrated remarkable results in the field of time-series analysis and have demonstrated effectiveness in modelling temporal correlations. It is crucial to capture both temporal and spatial correlations for a spatiotemporal process, as the values at nearby locations and time affect the values of a spatiotemporal process at a specific point. This self-contained paper explores various regional data-driven weather forecasting methods, i.e., forecasting over multiple latitude-longitude points (matrix-shaped spatial grid) to capture spatiotemporal correlations. The results showed that spatiotemporal prediction models reduced computational costs while improving accuracy. In particular, the proposed tensor train dynamic mode decomposition-based forecasting model has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art models without the need for training. We provide convincing numerical experiments to show that the proposed approach is practical."
2209.14915,Spiking Neural Networks for event-based action recognition: A new task   to understand their advantage,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are characterised by their unique temporal dynamics, but the properties and advantages of such computations are still not well understood. In order to provide answers, in this work we demonstrate how Spiking neurons can enable temporal feature extraction in feed-forward neural networks without the need for recurrent synapses, and how recurrent SNNs can achieve comparable results to LSTM with a smaller number of parameters. This shows how their bio-inspired computing principles can be successfully exploited beyond energy efficiency gains and evidences their differences with respect to conventional artificial neural networks. These results are obtained through a new task, DVS-Gesture-Chain (DVS-GC), which allows, for the first time, to evaluate the perception of temporal dependencies in a real event-based action recognition dataset. Our study proves how the widely used DVS Gesture benchmark can be solved by networks without temporal feature extraction when its events are accumulated in frames, unlike the new DVS-GC which demands an understanding of the order in which events happen. Furthermore, this setup allowed us to reveal the role of the leakage rate in spiking neurons for temporal processing tasks and demonstrated the benefits of ""hard reset"" mechanisms. Additionally, we also show how time-dependent weights and normalization can lead to understanding order by means of temporal attention."
2209.14946,EiHi Net: Out-of-Distribution Generalization Paradigm,"This paper develops a new EiHi net to solve the out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization problem in deep learning. EiHi net is a model learning paradigm that can be blessed on any visual backbone. This paradigm can change the previous learning method of the deep model, namely find out correlations between inductive sample features and corresponding categories, which suffers from pseudo correlations between indecisive features and labels. We fuse SimCLR and VIC-Reg via explicitly and dynamically establishing the original - positive - negative sample pair as a minimal learning element, the deep model iteratively establishes a relationship close to the causal one between features and labels, while suppressing pseudo correlations. To further validate the proposed model, and strengthen the established causal relationships, we develop a human-in-the-loop strategy, with few guidance samples, to prune the representation space directly. Finally, it is shown that the developed EiHi net makes significant improvements in the most difficult and typical OoD dataset Nico, compared with the current SOTA results, without any domain ($e.g.$ background, irrelevant features) information."
2209.15179,Physical Adversarial Attack meets Computer Vision: A Decade Survey,"Despite the impressive achievements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in computer vision, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. Extensive research has demonstrated that incorporating sophisticated perturbations into input images can lead to a catastrophic degradation in DNNs' performance. This perplexing phenomenon not only exists in the digital space but also in the physical world. Consequently, it becomes imperative to evaluate the security of DNNs-based systems to ensure their safe deployment in real-world scenarios, particularly in security-sensitive applications. To facilitate a profound understanding of this topic, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of physical adversarial attacks. Firstly, we distill four general steps for launching physical adversarial attacks. Building upon this foundation, we uncover the pervasive role of artifacts carrying adversarial perturbations in the physical world. These artifacts influence each step. To denote them, we introduce a new term: adversarial medium. Then, we take the first step to systematically evaluate the performance of physical adversarial attacks, taking the adversarial medium as a first attempt. Our proposed evaluation metric, hiPAA, comprises six perspectives: Effectiveness, Stealthiness, Robustness, Practicability, Aesthetics, and Economics. We also provide comparative results across task categories, together with insightful observations and suggestions for future research directions."
2209.15210,Multi-Prompt Alignment for Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Most existing methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) rely on a shared network to extract domain-invariant features. However, when facing multiple source domains, optimizing such a network involves updating the parameters of the entire network, making it both computationally expensive and challenging, particularly when coupled with min-max objectives. Inspired by recent advances in prompt learning that adapts high-capacity models for downstream tasks in a computationally economic way, we introduce Multi-Prompt Alignment (MPA), a simple yet efficient framework for multi-source UDA. Given a source and target domain pair, MPA first trains an individual prompt to minimize the domain gap through a contrastive loss. Then, MPA denoises the learned prompts through an auto-encoding process and aligns them by maximizing the agreement of all the reconstructed prompts. Moreover, we show that the resulting subspace acquired from the auto-encoding process can easily generalize to a streamlined set of target domains, making our method more efficient for practical usage. Extensive experiments show that MPA achieves state-of-the-art results on three popular datasets with an impressive average accuracy of 54.1% on DomainNet."
2209.15402,Rethinking the Learning Paradigm for Facial Expression Recognition,"Due to the subjective crowdsourcing annotations and the inherent inter-class similarity of facial expressions, the real-world Facial Expression Recognition (FER) datasets usually exhibit ambiguous annotation. To simplify the learning paradigm, most previous methods convert ambiguous annotation results into precise one-hot annotations and train FER models in an end-to-end supervised manner. In this paper, we rethink the existing training paradigm and propose that it is better to use weakly supervised strategies to train FER models with original ambiguous annotation."
2209.15525,Slimmable Networks for Contrastive Self-supervised Learning,"Self-supervised learning makes significant progress in pre-training large models, but struggles with small models. Mainstream solutions to this problem rely mainly on knowledge distillation, which involves a two-stage procedure: first training a large teacher model and then distilling it to improve the generalization ability of smaller ones. In this work, we introduce another one-stage solution to obtain pre-trained small models without the need for extra teachers, namely, slimmable networks for contrastive self-supervised learning (SlimCLR). A slimmable network consists of a full network and several weight-sharing sub-networks, which can be pre-trained once to obtain various networks, including small ones with low computation costs. However, interference between weight-sharing networks leads to severe performance degradation in self-supervised cases, as evidenced by gradient magnitude imbalance and gradient direction divergence. The former indicates that a small proportion of parameters produce dominant gradients during backpropagation, while the main parameters may not be fully optimized. The latter shows that the gradient direction is disordered, and the optimization process is unstable. To address these issues, we introduce three techniques to make the main parameters produce dominant gradients and sub-networks have consistent outputs. These techniques include slow start training of sub-networks, online distillation, and loss re-weighting according to model sizes. Furthermore, theoretical results are presented to demonstrate that a single slimmable linear layer is sub-optimal during linear evaluation. Thus a switchable linear probe layer is applied during linear evaluation. We instantiate SlimCLR with typical contrastive learning frameworks and achieve better performance than previous arts with fewer parameters and FLOPs. The code is at https://github.com/mzhaoshuai/SlimCLR."
2210.00036,Differentially Private Bias-Term Fine-tuning of Foundation Models,"We study the problem of differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of large pre-trained models -- a recent privacy-preserving approach suitable for solving downstream tasks with sensitive data. Existing work has demonstrated that high accuracy is possible under strong privacy constraint, yet requires significant computational overhead or modifications to the network architecture. We propose differentially private bias-term fine-tuning (DP-BiTFiT), which matches the state-of-the-art accuracy for DP algorithms and the efficiency of the standard BiTFiT. DP-BiTFiT is model agnostic (not modifying the network architecture), parameter efficient (only training about 0.1% of the parameters), and computation efficient (almost removing the overhead caused by DP, in both the time and space complexity). On a wide range of tasks, DP-BiTFiT is 2~30X faster and uses 2~8X less memory than DP full fine-tuning, even faster than the standard full fine-tuning. This amazing efficiency enables us to conduct DP fine-tuning on language and vision tasks with long-sequence texts and high-resolution images, which were computationally difficult using existing methods. We open-source our code at FastDP (https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy)."
2210.00220,A Dual-Attention Learning Network with Word and Sentence Embedding for   Medical Visual Question Answering,"Research in medical visual question answering (MVQA) can contribute to the development of computeraided diagnosis. MVQA is a task that aims to predict accurate and convincing answers based on given medical images and associated natural language questions. This task requires extracting medical knowledge-rich feature content and making fine-grained understandings of them. Therefore, constructing an effective feature extraction and understanding scheme are keys to modeling. Existing MVQA question extraction schemes mainly focus on word information, ignoring medical information in the text. Meanwhile, some visual and textual feature understanding schemes cannot effectively capture the correlation between regions and keywords for reasonable visual reasoning. In this study, a dual-attention learning network with word and sentence embedding (WSDAN) is proposed. We design a module, transformer with sentence embedding (TSE), to extract a double embedding representation of questions containing keywords and medical information. A dualattention learning (DAL) module consisting of self-attention and guided attention is proposed to model intensive intramodal and intermodal interactions. With multiple DAL modules (DALs), learning visual and textual co-attention can increase the granularity of understanding and improve visual reasoning. Experimental results on the ImageCLEF 2019 VQA-MED (VQA-MED 2019) and VQA-RAD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. According to the ablation studies and Grad-CAM maps, WSDAN can extract rich textual information and has strong visual reasoning ability."
2210.00294,Gait-based Age Group Classification with Adaptive Graph Neural Network,"Deep learning techniques have recently been utilized for model-free age-associated gait feature extraction. However, acquiring model-free gait demands accurate pre-processing such as background subtraction, which is non-trivial in unconstrained environments. On the other hand, model-based gait can be obtained without background subtraction and is less affected by covariates. For model-based gait-based age group classification problems, present works rely solely on handcrafted features, where feature extraction is tedious and requires domain expertise. This paper proposes a deep learning approach to extract age-associated features from model-based gait for age group classification. Specifically, we first develop an unconstrained gait dataset called Multimedia University Gait Age and Gender dataset (MMU GAG). Next, the body joint coordinates are determined via pose estimation algorithms and represented as compact gait graphs via a novel part aggregation scheme. Then, a Part-AdaptIve Residual Graph Convolutional Neural Network (PairGCN) is designed for age-associated feature learning. Experiments suggest that PairGCN features are far more informative than handcrafted features, yielding up to 99% accuracy for classifying subjects as a child, adult, or senior in the MMU GAG dataset. These results suggest the feasibility of deploying Artificial Intelligence-enabled solutions for access control, surveillance, and law enforcement in unconstrained environments."
2210.00314,Learning Hierarchical Image Segmentation For Recognition and By   Recognition,"Large vision and language models learned directly through image-text associations often lack detailed visual substantiation, whereas image segmentation tasks are treated separately from recognition, supervisedly learned without interconnections. Our key observation is that, while an image can be recognized in multiple ways, each has a consistent part-and-whole visual organization. Segmentation thus should be treated not as an end task to be mastered through supervised learning, but as an internal process that evolves with and supports the ultimate goal of recognition. We propose to integrate a hierarchical segmenter into the recognition process, train and adapt the entire model solely on image-level recognition objectives. We learn hierarchical segmentation for free alongside recognition, automatically uncovering part-to-whole relationships that not only underpin but also enhance recognition. Enhancing the Vision Transformer (ViT) with adaptive segment tokens and graph pooling, our model surpasses ViT in unsupervised part-whole discovery, semantic segmentation, image classification, and efficiency. Notably, our model (trained on unlabeled 1M ImageNet images) outperforms SAM (trained on 11M images and 1 billion masks) by absolute 8% in mIoU on PartImageNet object segmentation."
2210.00823,BVI-VFI: A Video Quality Database for Video Frame Interpolation,"Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental research topic in video processing, which is currently attracting increased attention across the research community. While the development of more advanced VFI algorithms has been extensively researched, there remains little understanding of how humans perceive the quality of interpolated content and how well existing objective quality assessment methods perform when measuring the perceived quality. In order to narrow this research gap, we have developed a new video quality database named BVI-VFI, which contains 540 distorted sequences generated by applying five commonly used VFI algorithms to 36 diverse source videos with various spatial resolutions and frame rates. We collected more than 10,800 quality ratings for these videos through a large scale subjective study involving 189 human subjects. Based on the collected subjective scores, we further analysed the influence of VFI algorithms and frame rates on the perceptual quality of interpolated videos. Moreover, we benchmarked the performance of 33 classic and state-of-the-art objective image/video quality metrics on the new database, and demonstrated the urgent requirement for more accurate bespoke quality assessment methods for VFI. To facilitate further research in this area, we have made BVI-VFI publicly available at https://github.com/danier97/BVI-VFI-database."
2210.01272,A systematic review of the use of Deep Learning in Satellite Imagery for   Agriculture,"Agricultural research is essential for increasing food production to meet the requirements of an increasing population in the coming decades. Recently, satellite technology has been improving rapidly and deep learning has seen much success in generic computer vision tasks and many application areas which presents an important opportunity to improve analysis of agricultural land. Here we present a systematic review of 150 studies to find the current uses of deep learning on satellite imagery for agricultural research. Although we identify 5 categories of agricultural monitoring tasks, the majority of the research interest is in crop segmentation and yield prediction. We found that, when used, modern deep learning methods consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across most tasks; the only exception was that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks did not consistently outperform Random Forests (RF) for yield prediction. The reviewed studies have largely adopted methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission: benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed studies."
2210.01302,Nuisances via Negativa: Adjusting for Spurious Correlations via Data   Augmentation,"In prediction tasks, there exist features that are related to the label in the same way across different settings for that task; these are semantic features or semantics. Features with varying relationships to the label are nuisances. For example, in detecting cows from natural images, the shape of the head is semantic but because images of cows often have grass backgrounds but not always, the background is a nuisance. Models that exploit nuisance-label relationships face performance degradation when these relationships change. Building models robust to such changes requires additional knowledge beyond samples of the features and labels. For example, existing work uses annotations of nuisances or assumes ERM-trained models depend on nuisances. Approaches to integrate new kinds of additional knowledge enlarge the settings where robust models can be built. We develop an approach to use knowledge about the semantics by corrupting them in data, and then using the corrupted data to produce models which identify correlations between nuisances and the label. Once these correlations are identified, they can be used to adjust for where nuisances drive predictions. We study semantic corruptions in powering different spurious-correlation avoiding methods on multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks like classifying waterbirds, natural language inference (NLI), and detecting cardiomegaly in chest X-rays."
2210.01595,FreDSNet: Joint Monocular Depth and Semantic Segmentation with Fast   Fourier Convolutions,"In this work we present FreDSNet, a deep learning solution which obtains semantic 3D understanding of indoor environments from single panoramas. Omnidirectional images reveal task-specific advantages when addressing scene understanding problems due to the 360-degree contextual information about the entire environment they provide. However, the inherent characteristics of the omnidirectional images add additional problems to obtain an accurate detection and segmentation of objects or a good depth estimation. To overcome these problems, we exploit convolutions in the frequential domain obtaining a wider receptive field in each convolutional layer. These convolutions allow to leverage the whole context information from omnidirectional images. FreDSNet is the first network that jointly provides monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation from a single panoramic image exploiting fast Fourier convolutions. Our experiments show that FreDSNet has similar performance as specific state of the art methods for semantic segmentation and depth estimation. FreDSNet code is publicly available in https://github.com/Sbrunoberenguel/FreDSNet"
2210.01603,Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization,"Current learning models often struggle with human-like systematic generalization, particularly in learning compositional rules from limited data and extrapolating them to novel combinations. We introduce the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR), whose core is a Grounded Symbol System (GSS), allowing for the emergence of combinatorial syntax and semantics directly from training data. The NSR employs a modular design that integrates neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic reasoning. These components are synergistically trained through a novel deduction-abduction algorithm. Our findings demonstrate that NSR's design, imbued with the inductive biases of equivariance and compositionality, grants it the expressiveness to adeptly handle diverse sequence-to-sequence tasks and achieve unparalleled systematic generalization. We evaluate NSR's efficacy across four challenging benchmarks designed to probe systematic generalization capabilities: SCAN for semantic parsing, PCFG for string manipulation, HINT for arithmetic reasoning, and a compositional machine translation task. The results affirm NSR's superiority over contemporary neural and hybrid models in terms of generalization and transferability."
2210.01607,A Generative Shape Compositional Framework to Synthesise Populations of   Virtual Chimaeras,"Generating virtual populations of anatomy that capture sufficient variability while remaining plausible is essential for conducting in-silico trials of medical devices. However, not all anatomical shapes of interest are always available for each individual in a population. Hence, missing/partially-overlapping anatomical information is often available across individuals in a population. We introduce a generative shape model for complex anatomical structures, learnable from datasets of unpaired datasets. The proposed generative model can synthesise complete whole complex shape assemblies coined virtual chimaeras, as opposed to natural human chimaeras. We applied this framework to build virtual chimaeras from databases of whole-heart shape assemblies that each contribute samples for heart substructures. Specifically, we propose a generative shape compositional framework which comprises two components - a part-aware generative shape model which captures the variability in shape observed for each structure of interest in the training population; and a spatial composition network which assembles/composes the structures synthesised by the former into multi-part shape assemblies (viz. virtual chimaeras). We also propose a novel self supervised learning scheme that enables the spatial composition network to be trained with partially overlapping data and weak labels. We trained and validated our approach using shapes of cardiac structures derived from cardiac magnetic resonance images available in the UK Biobank. Our approach significantly outperforms a PCA-based shape model (trained with complete data) in terms of generalisability and specificity. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach as the synthesised cardiac virtual populations are more plausible and capture a greater degree of variability in shape than those generated by the PCA-based shape model."
2210.01708,Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to Enable Foundation Models in   Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling the collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown to be effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters, known as the ""Foundation Models."" In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems."
2210.01742,CADet: Fully Self-Supervised Out-Of-Distribution Detection With   Contrastive Learning,"Handling out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has become a major stake in the real-world deployment of machine learning systems. This work explores the use of self-supervised contrastive learning to the simultaneous detection of two types of OOD samples: unseen classes and adversarial perturbations. First, we pair self-supervised contrastive learning with the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) two-sample test. This approach enables us to robustly test whether two independent sets of samples originate from the same distribution, and we demonstrate its effectiveness by discriminating between CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10.1 with higher confidence than previous work. Motivated by this success, we introduce CADet (Contrastive Anomaly Detection), a novel method for OOD detection of single samples. CADet draws inspiration from MMD, but leverages the similarity between contrastive transformations of a same sample. CADet outperforms existing adversarial detection methods in identifying adversarially perturbed samples on ImageNet and achieves comparable performance to unseen label detection methods on two challenging benchmarks: ImageNet-O and iNaturalist. Significantly, CADet is fully self-supervised and requires neither labels for in-distribution samples nor access to OOD examples."
2210.02249,LDEdit: Towards Generalized Text Guided Image Manipulation via Latent   Diffusion Models,"Research in vision-language models has seen rapid developments off-late, enabling natural language-based interfaces for image generation and manipulation. Many existing text guided manipulation techniques are restricted to specific classes of images, and often require fine-tuning to transfer to a different style or domain. Nevertheless, generic image manipulation using a single model with flexible text inputs is highly desirable. Recent work addresses this task by guiding generative models trained on the generic image datasets using pretrained vision-language encoders. While promising, this approach requires expensive optimization for each input. In this work, we propose an optimization-free method for the task of generic image manipulation from text prompts. Our approach exploits recent Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) for text to image generation to achieve zero-shot text guided manipulation. We employ a deterministic forward diffusion in a lower dimensional latent space, and the desired manipulation is achieved by simply providing the target text to condition the reverse diffusion process. We refer to our approach as LDEdit. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on semantic image manipulation and artistic style transfer. Our method can accomplish image manipulation on diverse domains and enables editing multiple attributes in a straightforward fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefit of our approach over competing baselines."
2210.02757,CAP-UDF: Learning Unsigned Distance Functions Progressively from Raw   Point Clouds with Consistency-Aware Field Optimization,"Surface reconstruction for point clouds is an important task in 3D computer vision. Most of the latest methods resolve this problem by learning signed distance functions from point clouds, which are limited to reconstructing closed surfaces. Some other methods tried to represent open surfaces using unsigned distance functions (UDF) which are learned from ground truth distances. However, the learned UDF is hard to provide smooth distance fields due to the discontinuous character of point clouds. In this paper, we propose CAP-UDF, a novel method to learn consistency-aware UDF from raw point clouds. We achieve this by learning to move queries onto the surface with a field consistency constraint, where we also enable to progressively estimate a more accurate surface. Specifically, we train a neural network to gradually infer the relationship between queries and the approximated surface by searching for the moving target of queries in a dynamic way. Meanwhile, we introduce a polygonization algorithm to extract surfaces using the gradients of the learned UDF. We conduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction for point clouds, real scans or depth maps, and further explore our performance in unsupervised point normal estimation, which demonstrate non-trivial improvements of CAP-UDF over the state-of-the-art methods."
2210.02884,Vision+X: A Survey on Multimodal Learning in the Light of Data,"We are perceiving and communicating with the world in a multisensory manner, where different information sources are sophisticatedly processed and interpreted by separate parts of the human brain to constitute a complex, yet harmonious and unified sensing system. To endow the machines with true intelligence, multimodal machine learning that incorporates data from various sources has become an increasingly popular research area with emerging technical advances in recent years. In this paper, we present a survey on multimodal machine learning from a novel perspective considering not only the purely technical aspects but also the intrinsic nature of different data modalities. We analyze the commonness and uniqueness of each data format mainly ranging from vision, audio, text, and motions, and then present the methodological advancements categorized by the combination of data modalities, such as Vision+Text, with slightly inclined emphasis on the visual data. We investigate the existing literature on multimodal learning from both the representation learning and downstream application levels, and provide an additional comparison in the light of their technical connections with the data nature, e.g., the semantic consistency between image objects and textual descriptions, and the rhythm correspondence between video dance moves and musical beats. We hope that the exploitation of the alignment as well as the existing gap between the intrinsic nature of data modality and the technical designs, will benefit future research studies to better address a specific challenge related to the concrete multimodal task, prompting a unified multimodal machine learning framework closer to a real human intelligence system."
2210.02984,The Lie Derivative for Measuring Learned Equivariance,"Equivariance guarantees that a model's predictions capture key symmetries in data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we introduce the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative, we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example, transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after training."
2210.02992,"COVID-19 Detection Using Segmentation, Region Extraction and   Classification Pipeline","The main purpose of this study is to develop a pipeline for COVID-19 detection from a big and challenging database of Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed pipeline includes a segmentation part, a lung extraction part, and a classifier part. Optional slice removal techniques after UNet-based segmentation of slices were also tried. The methodologies tried in the segmentation part are traditional segmentation methods as well as UNet-based methods. In the classification part, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to take the final diagnosis decisions. In terms of the results: in the segmentation part, the proposed segmentation methods show high dice scores on a publicly available dataset. In the classification part, the results were compared at slice-level and at patient-level as well. At slice-level, methods were compared and showed high validation accuracy indicating efficiency in predicting 2D slices. At patient level, the proposed methods were also compared in terms of validation accuracy and macro F1 score on the validation set. The dataset used for classification is COV-19CT Database. The method proposed here showed improvement from our precious results on the same dataset. In Conclusion, the improved work in this paper has potential clinical usages for COVID-19 detection and diagnosis via CT images. The code is on github at https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_3rd"
2210.03299,A Learning-based Framework for Topology-Preserving Segmentation using   Quasiconformal Mappings,"We propose the Topology-Preserving Segmentation Network, a deformation-based model that can extract objects in an image while maintaining their topological properties. This network generates segmentation masks that have the same topology as the template mask, even when trained with limited data. The network consists of two components: the Deformation Estimation Network, which produces a deformation map that warps the template mask to enclose the region of interest, and the Beltrami Adjustment Module, which ensures the bijectivity of the deformation map by truncating the associated Beltrami coefficient based on Quasiconformal theories. The proposed network can also be trained in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled training data. This is achieved by incorporating an unsupervised segmentation loss. Our experimental results on various image datasets show that TPSN achieves better segmentation accuracy than state-of-the-art models with correct topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate TPSN's ability to handle multiple object segmentation."
2210.03437,PCKRF: Point Cloud Completion and Keypoint Refinement With Fusion Data   for 6D Pose Estimation,"Some robust point cloud registration approaches with controllable pose refinement magnitude, such as ICP and its variants, are commonly used to improve 6D pose estimation accuracy. However, the effectiveness of these methods gradually diminishes with the advancement of deep learning techniques and the enhancement of initial pose accuracy, primarily due to their lack of specific design for pose refinement. In this paper, we propose Point Cloud Completion and Keypoint Refinement with Fusion Data (PCKRF), a new pose refinement pipeline for 6D pose estimation. The pipeline consists of two steps. First, it completes the input point clouds via a novel pose-sensitive point completion network. The network uses both local and global features with pose information during point completion. Then, it registers the completed object point cloud with the corresponding target point cloud by our proposed Color supported Iterative KeyPoint (CIKP) method. The CIKP method introduces color information into registration and registers a point cloud around each keypoint to increase stability. The PCKRF pipeline can be integrated with existing popular 6D pose estimation methods, such as the full flow bidirectional fusion network, to further improve their pose estimation accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior stability compared to existing approaches when optimizing initial poses with relatively high precision. Notably, the results indicate that our method effectively complements most existing pose estimation techniques, leading to improved performance in most cases. Furthermore, our method achieves promising results even in challenging scenarios involving textureless and symmetrical objects. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zhanhz/KRF."
2210.03461,FastCLIPstyler: Optimisation-free Text-based Image Style Transfer Using   Style Representations,"In recent years, language-driven artistic style transfer has emerged as a new type of style transfer technique, eliminating the need for a reference style image by using natural language descriptions of the style. The first model to achieve this, called CLIPstyler, has demonstrated impressive stylisation results. However, its lengthy optimisation procedure at runtime for each query limits its suitability for many practical applications. In this work, we present FastCLIPstyler, a generalised text-based image style transfer model capable of stylising images in a single forward pass for arbitrary text inputs. Furthermore, we introduce EdgeCLIPstyler, a lightweight model designed for compatibility with resource-constrained devices. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate that our models achieve superior stylisation quality based on measurable metrics while offering significantly improved runtime efficiency, particularly on edge devices."
2210.03510,Learning to Learn and Sample BRDFs,"We propose a method to accelerate the joint process of physically acquiring and learning neural Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) models. While BRDF learning alone can be accelerated by meta-learning, acquisition remains slow as it relies on a mechanical process. We show that meta-learning can be extended to optimize the physical sampling pattern, too. After our method has been meta-trained for a set of fully-sampled BRDFs, it is able to quickly train on new BRDFs with up to five orders of magnitude fewer physical acquisition samples at similar quality. Our approach also extends to other linear and non-linear BRDF models, which we show in an extensive evaluation."
2210.03919,"CLIP-PAE: Projection-Augmentation Embedding to Extract Relevant Features   for a Disentangled, Interpretable, and Controllable Text-Guided Face   Manipulation","Recently introduced Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) bridges images and text by embedding them into a joint latent space. This opens the door to ample literature that aims to manipulate an input image by providing a textual explanation. However, due to the discrepancy between image and text embeddings in the joint space, using text embeddings as the optimization target often introduces undesired artifacts in the resulting images. Disentanglement, interpretability, and controllability are also hard to guarantee for manipulation. To alleviate these problems, we propose to define corpus subspaces spanned by relevant prompts to capture specific image characteristics. We introduce CLIP Projection-Augmentation Embedding (PAE) as an optimization target to improve the performance of text-guided image manipulation. Our method is a simple and general paradigm that can be easily computed and adapted, and smoothly incorporated into any CLIP-based image manipulation algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct several theoretical and empirical studies. As a case study, we utilize the method for text-guided semantic face editing. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that PAE facilitates a more disentangled, interpretable, and controllable image manipulation with state-of-the-art quality and accuracy.

2210.04288,CoopHash: Cooperative Learning of Multipurpose Descriptor and   Contrastive Pair Generator via Variational MCMC Teaching for Supervised Image   Hashing,"Leveraging supervised information can lead to superior retrieval performance in the image hashing domain but the performance degrades significantly without enough labeled data. One effective solution to boost performance is to employ generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to generate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However, GAN-based methods are difficult to train, which prevents the hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash functions. This limitation results in sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the generative cooperative hashing network, which is based on energy-based cooperative learning. This framework jointly learns a powerful generative representation of the data and a robust hash function via two components: a top-down contrastive pair generator that synthesizes contrastive images and a bottom-up multipurpose descriptor that simultaneously represents the images from multiple perspectives, including probability density, hash code, latent code, and category. The two components are jointly learned via a novel likelihood-based cooperative learning scheme. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing supervised methods, achieving up to 10\% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods, and exhibits a significantly better performance in out-of-distribution retrieval."
2210.04522,HORIZON: High-Resolution Semantically Controlled Panorama Synthesis,"Panorama synthesis endeavors to craft captivating 360-degree visual landscapes, immersing users in the heart of virtual worlds. Nevertheless, contemporary panoramic synthesis techniques grapple with the challenge of semantically guiding the content generation process. Although recent breakthroughs in visual synthesis have unlocked the potential for semantic control in 2D flat images, a direct application of these methods to panorama synthesis yields distorted content. In this study, we unveil an innovative framework for generating high-resolution panoramas, adeptly addressing the issues of spherical distortion and edge discontinuity through sophisticated spherical modeling. Our pioneering approach empowers users with semantic control, harnessing both image and text inputs, while concurrently streamlining the generation of high-resolution panoramas using parallel decoding. We rigorously evaluate our methodology on a diverse array of indoor and outdoor datasets, establishing its superiority over recent related work, in terms of both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Our research elevates the controllability, efficiency, and fidelity of panorama synthesis to new levels."
2210.04561,A Comprehensive Survey of Data Augmentation in Visual Reinforcement   Learning,"Visual reinforcement learning (RL), which makes decisions directly from high-dimensional visual inputs, has demonstrated significant potential in various domains. However, deploying visual RL techniques in the real world remains challenging due to their low sample efficiency and large generalization gaps. To tackle these obstacles, data augmentation (DA) has become a widely used technique in visual RL for acquiring sample-efficient and generalizable policies by diversifying the training data. This survey aims to provide a timely and essential review of DA techniques in visual RL in recognition of the thriving development in this field. In particular, we propose a unified framework for analyzing visual RL and understanding the role of DA in it. We then present a principled taxonomy of the existing augmentation techniques used in visual RL and conduct an in-depth discussion on how to better leverage augmented data in different scenarios. Moreover, we report a systematic empirical evaluation of DA-based techniques in visual RL and conclude by highlighting the directions for future research. As the first comprehensive survey of DA in visual RL, this work is expected to offer valuable guidance to this emerging field."
2210.04936,EarthNets: Empowering AI in Earth Observation,"Earth observation (EO), aiming at monitoring the state of planet Earth using remote sensing data, is critical for improving our daily lives and living environment. With a growing number of satellites in orbit, an increasing number of datasets with diverse sensors and research domains are being published to facilitate the research of the remote sensing community. This paper presents a comprehensive review of more than 500 publicly published datasets, including research domains like agriculture, land use and land cover, disaster monitoring, scene understanding, vision-language models, foundation models, climate change, and weather forecasting. We systematically analyze these EO datasets from four aspects: volume, resolution distributions, research domains, and the correlation between datasets. Based on the dataset attributes, we propose to measure, rank, and select datasets to build a new benchmark for model evaluation. Furthermore, a new platform for EO, termed EarthNets, is released to achieve a fair and consistent evaluation of deep learning methods on remote sensing data. EarthNets supports standard dataset libraries and cutting-edge deep learning models to bridge the gap between the remote sensing and machine learning communities. Based on this platform, extensive deep-learning methods are evaluated on the new benchmark. The insightful results are beneficial to future research. The platform and dataset collections are publicly available at https://earthnets.github.io."
2210.04979,Label-free segmentation from cardiac ultrasound using self-supervised   learning,"Segmentation and measurement of cardiac chambers is critical in cardiac ultrasound but is laborious and poorly reproducible. Neural networks can assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manual annotations. We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labels) segmentation combining computer vision, clinical domain knowledge, and deep learning. We trained on 450 echocardiograms (93,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; mean 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculate biometrics. We also tested against external images from an additional 10,030 patients with available manual tracings of the left ventricle. r2 between clinically measured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reported inter-clinician variation and comparable to supervised learning across several different measurements (r2 0.56-0.84). Average accuracy for detecting abnormal chamber size and function was 0.85 (range 0.71-0.97) compared to clinical measurements. A subset of test echocardiograms (n=553) had corresponding cardiac MRIs, where MRI is the gold standard. Correlation between pipeline and MRI measurements was similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and MRI. Finally, the pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with an average Dice score of 0.89 (95% CI [0.89]) in the external, manually labeled dataset. Our results demonstrate a manual-label free, clinically valid, and highly scalable method for segmentation from ultrasound, a noisy but globally important imaging modality."
2210.05119,Exploring CNN-based models for image's aesthetic score prediction with   using ensemble,"In this paper, we proposed a framework of constructing two types of the automatic image aesthetics assessment models with different CNN architectures and improving the performance of the image's aesthetic score prediction by the ensemble. Moreover, the attention regions of the models to the images are extracted to analyze the consistency with the subjects in the images. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is effective for improving the AS prediction. Moreover, it is found that the AS classification models trained on XiheAA dataset seem to learn the latent photography principles, although it can't be said that they learn the aesthetic sense."
2210.05242,Leveraging the Video-level Semantic Consistency of Event for   Audio-visual Event Localization,"Audio-visual event (AVE) localization has attracted much attention in recent years. Most existing methods are often limited to independently encoding and classifying each video segment separated from the full video (which can be regarded as the segment-level representations of events). However, they ignore the semantic consistency of the event within the same full video (which can be considered as the video-level representations of events). In contrast to existing methods, we propose a novel video-level semantic consistency guidance network for the AVE localization task. Specifically, we propose an event semantic consistency modeling (ESCM) module to explore video-level semantic information for semantic consistency modeling. It consists of two components: a cross-modal event representation extractor (CERE) and an intra-modal semantic consistency enhancer (ISCE). CERE is proposed to obtain the event semantic information at the video level. Furthermore, ISCE takes video-level event semantics as prior knowledge to guide the model to focus on the semantic continuity of an event within each modality. Moreover, we propose a new negative pair filter loss to encourage the network to filter out the irrelevant segment pairs and a new smooth loss to further increase the gap between different categories of events in the weakly-supervised setting. We perform extensive experiments on the public AVE dataset and outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both fully- and weakly-supervised settings, thus verifying the effectiveness of our method.The code is available at https://github.com/Bravo5542/VSCG."
2210.05332,Gender Stereotyping Impact in Facial Expression Recognition,"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) uses images of faces to identify the emotional state of users, allowing for a closer interaction between humans and autonomous systems. Unfortunately, as the images naturally integrate some demographic information, such as apparent age, gender, and race of the subject, these systems are prone to demographic bias issues. In recent years, machine learning-based models have become the most popular approach to FER. These models require training on large datasets of facial expression images, and their generalization capabilities are strongly related to the characteristics of the dataset. In publicly available FER datasets, apparent gender representation is usually mostly balanced, but their representation in the individual label is not, embedding social stereotypes into the datasets and generating a potential for harm. Although this type of bias has been overlooked so far, it is important to understand the impact it may have in the context of FER. To do so, we use a popular FER dataset, FER+, to generate derivative datasets with different amounts of stereotypical bias by altering the gender proportions of certain labels. We then proceed to measure the discrepancy between the performance of the models trained on these datasets for the apparent gender groups. We observe a discrepancy in the recognition of certain emotions between genders of up to $29 \%$ under the worst bias conditions. Our results also suggest a safety range for stereotypical bias in a dataset that does not appear to produce stereotypical bias in the resulting model. Our findings support the need for a thorough bias analysis of public datasets in problems like FER, where a global balance of demographic representation can still hide other types of bias that harm certain demographic groups."
2210.05438,Parallel Augmentation and Dual Enhancement for Occluded Person   Re-identification,"Occluded person re-identification (Re-ID), the task of searching for the same person's images in occluded environments, has attracted lots of attention in the past decades. Recent approaches concentrate on improving performance on occluded data by data/feature augmentation or using extra models to predict occlusions. However, they ignore the imbalance problem in this task and can not fully utilize the information from the training data. To alleviate these two issues, we propose a simple yet effective method with Parallel Augmentation and Dual Enhancement (PADE), which is robust on both occluded and non-occluded data and does not require any auxiliary clues. First, we design a parallel augmentation mechanism (PAM) to generate more suitable occluded data to mitigate the negative effects of unbalanced data. Second, we propose the global and local dual enhancement strategy (DES) to promote the context information and details. Experimental results on three widely used occluded datasets and two non-occluded datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/littleprince1121/PADE_Parallel_Augmentation_and_Dual_Enhancement_for_Occluded_Person_ReID"
2210.05663,CLIP-Fields: Weakly Supervised Semantic Fields for Robotic Memory,"We propose CLIP-Fields, an implicit scene model that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as segmentation, instance identification, semantic search over space, and view localization. CLIP-Fields learns a mapping from spatial locations to semantic embedding vectors. Importantly, we show that this mapping can be trained with supervision coming only from web-image and web-text trained models such as CLIP, Detic, and Sentence-BERT; and thus uses no direct human supervision. When compared to baselines like Mask-RCNN, our method outperforms on few-shot instance identification or semantic segmentation on the HM3D dataset with only a fraction of the examples. Finally, we show that using CLIP-Fields as a scene memory, robots can perform semantic navigation in real-world environments. Our code and demonstration videos are available here: https://mahis.life/clip-fields"
2210.05870,LACV-Net: Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Point Cloud Scene via   Local Adaptive and Comprehensive VLAD,"Large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation is an important task in 3D computer vision, which is widely applied in autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. Current large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation methods usually use down-sampling operations to improve computation efficiency and acquire point clouds with multi-resolution. However, this may cause the problem of missing local information. Meanwhile, it is difficult for networks to capture global information in large-scale distributed contexts. To capture local and global information effectively, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network called LACV-Net for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. The proposed network contains three main components: 1) a local adaptive feature augmentation module (LAFA) to adaptively learn the similarity of centroids and neighboring points to augment the local context; 2) a comprehensive VLAD module (C-VLAD) that fuses local features with multi-layer, multi-scale, and multi-resolution to represent a comprehensive global description vector; and 3) an aggregation loss function to effectively optimize the segmentation boundaries by constraining the adaptive weight from the LAFA module. Compared to state-of-the-art networks on several large-scale benchmark datasets, including S3DIS, Toronto3D, and SensatUrban, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed network."
2210.05952,3D Brain and Heart Volume Generative Models: A Survey,"Generative models such as generative adversarial networks and autoencoders have gained a great deal of attention in the medical field due to their excellent data generation capability. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of generative models for three-dimensional (3D) volumes, focusing on the brain and heart. A new and elaborate taxonomy of unconditional and conditional generative models is proposed to cover diverse medical tasks for the brain and heart: unconditional synthesis, classification, conditional synthesis, segmentation, denoising, detection, and registration.

2210.06094,Teeth3DS+: An Extended Benchmark for Intraoral 3D Scans Analysis,"Intraoral 3D scans analysis is a fundamental aspect of Computer-Aided Dentistry (CAD) systems, playing a crucial role in various dental applications, including teeth segmentation, detection, labeling, and dental landmark identification. Accurate analysis of 3D dental scans is essential for orthodontic and prosthetic treatment planning, as it enables automated processing and reduces the need for manual adjustments by dental professionals. However, developing robust automated tools for these tasks remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of high-quality public datasets and benchmarks. This article introduces Teeth3DS+, the first comprehensive public benchmark designed to advance the field of intraoral 3D scan analysis. Developed as part of the 3DTeethSeg 2022 and 3DTeethLand 2024 MICCAI challenges, Teeth3DS+ aims to drive research in teeth identification, segmentation, labeling, 3D modeling, and dental landmarks identification. The dataset includes at least 1,800 intraoral scans (containing 23,999 annotated teeth) collected from 900 patients, covering both upper and lower jaws separately. All data have been acquired and validated by experienced orthodontists and dental surgeons with over five years of expertise.

2210.06186,GOTCHA: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response,"With the rise of AI-enabled Real-Time Deepfakes (RTDFs), the integrity of online video interactions has become a growing concern. RTDFs have now made it feasible to replace an imposter's face with their victim in live video interactions. Such advancement in deepfakes also coaxes detection to rise to the same standard. However, existing deepfake detection techniques are asynchronous and hence ill-suited for RTDFs. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenge-response approach that establishes authenticity in live settings. We focus on talking-head style video interaction and present a taxonomy of challenges that specifically target inherent limitations of RTDF generation pipelines. We evaluate representative examples from the taxonomy by collecting a unique dataset comprising eight challenges, which consistently and visibly degrades the quality of state-of-the-art deepfake generators. These results are corroborated both by humans and a new automated scoring function, leading to 88.6% and 80.1% AUC, respectively. The findings underscore the promising potential of challenge-response systems for explainable and scalable real-time deepfake detection in practical scenarios. We provide access to data and code at \url{https://github.com/mittalgovind/GOTCHA-Deepfakes}."
2210.06225,On the Generalizability of ECG-based Stress Detection Models,"Stress is prevalent in many aspects of everyday life including work, healthcare, and social interactions. Many works have studied handcrafted features from various bio-signals that are indicators of stress. Recently, deep learning models have also been proposed to detect stress. Typically, stress models are trained and validated on the same dataset, often involving one stressful scenario. However, it is not practical to collect stress data for every scenario. So, it is crucial to study the generalizability of these models and determine to what extent they can be used in other scenarios. In this paper, we explore the generalization capabilities of Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based deep learning models and models based on handcrafted ECG features, i.e., Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. To this end, we train three HRV models and two deep learning models that use ECG signals as input. We use ECG signals from two popular stress datasets - WESAD and SWELL-KW - differing in terms of stressors and recording devices. First, we evaluate the models using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation using training and validation samples from the same dataset. Next, we perform a cross-dataset validation of the models, that is, LOSO models trained on the WESAD dataset are validated using SWELL-KW samples and vice versa. While deep learning models achieve the best results on the same dataset, models based on HRV features considerably outperform them on data from a different dataset. This trend is observed for all the models on both datasets. Therefore, HRV models are a better choice for stress recognition in applications that are different from the dataset scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compare the cross-dataset generalizability between ECG-based deep learning models and HRV models."
2210.06323,AISFormer: Amodal Instance Segmentation with Transformer,"Amodal Instance Segmentation (AIS) aims to segment the region of both visible and possible occluded parts of an object instance. While Mask R-CNN-based AIS approaches have shown promising results, they are unable to model high-level features coherence due to the limited receptive field. The most recent transformer-based models show impressive performance on vision tasks, even better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we present AISFormer, an AIS framework, with a Transformer-based mask head. AISFormer explicitly models the complex coherence between occluder, visible, amodal, and invisible masks within an object's regions of interest by treating them as learnable queries. Specifically, AISFormer contains four modules: (i) feature encoding: extract ROI and learn both short-range and long-range visual features. (ii) mask transformer decoding: generate the occluder, visible, and amodal mask query embeddings by a transformer decoder (iii) invisible mask embedding: model the coherence between the amodal and visible masks, and (iv) mask predicting: estimate output masks including occluder, visible, amodal and invisible. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on three challenging benchmarks i.e. KINS, D2SA, and COCOA-cls to evaluate the effectiveness of AISFormer. The code is available at: https://github.com/UARK-AICV/AISFormer"
2210.06330,CoRRECT: A Deep Unfolding Framework for Motion-Corrected Quantitative   R2* Mapping,"Quantitative MRI (qMRI) refers to a class of MRI methods for quantifying the spatial distribution of biological tissue parameters. Traditional qMRI methods usually deal separately with artifacts arising from accelerated data acquisition, involuntary physical motion, and magnetic-field inhomogeneities, leading to suboptimal end-to-end performance. This paper presents CoRRECT, a unified deep unfolding (DU) framework for qMRI consisting of a model-based end-to-end neural network, a method for motion-artifact reduction, and a self-supervised learning scheme. The network is trained to produce R2* maps whose k-space data matches the real data by also accounting for motion and field inhomogeneities. When deployed, CoRRECT only uses the k-space data without any pre-computed parameters for motion or inhomogeneity correction. Our results on experimentally collected multi-Gradient-Recalled Echo (mGRE) MRI data show that CoRRECT recovers motion and inhomogeneity artifact-free R2* maps in highly accelerated acquisition settings. This work opens the door to DU methods that can integrate physical measurement models, biophysical signal models, and learned prior models for high-quality qMRI."
2210.06433,Self-supervised video pretraining yields robust and more human-aligned   visual representations,"Humans learn powerful representations of objects and scenes by observing how they evolve over time. Yet, outside of specific tasks that require explicit temporal understanding, static image pretraining remains the dominant paradigm for learning visual foundation models. We question this mismatch, and ask whether video pretraining can yield visual representations that bear the hallmarks of human perception: generalisation across tasks, robustness to perturbations, and consistency with human judgements. To that end we propose a novel procedure for curating videos, and develop a contrastive framework which learns from the complex transformations therein. This simple paradigm for distilling knowledge from videos, called VITO, yields general representations that far outperform prior video pretraining methods on image understanding tasks, and image pretraining methods on video understanding tasks. Moreover, VITO representations are significantly more robust to natural and synthetic deformations than image-, video-, and adversarially-trained ones. Finally, VITO's predictions are strongly aligned with human judgements, surpassing models that were specifically trained for that purpose. Together, these results suggest that video pretraining could be a simple way of learning unified, robust, and human-aligned representations of the visual world."
2210.06466,Prompt Generation Networks for Input-Space Adaptation of Frozen Vision   Transformers,"With the introduction of the transformer architecture in computer vision, increasing model scale has been demonstrated as a clear path to achieving performance and robustness gains. However, with model parameter counts reaching the billions, classical finetuning approaches are becoming increasingly limiting and even unfeasible when models become hosted as inference APIs, as in NLP. Visual input-prompt learning, an adaptation technique in which additional inputs in visual (RGB) space are learned, has emerged as a potential solution for adapting frozen and cloud-hosted models, requiring neither access to the forward pass, nor post-processing. Yet so far, these constraints have deteriorated adaptation performances significantly. To this end, we propose the Prompt Generation Network (PGN) that generates a different prompt for every data point, which is then used to adapt a frozen pretrained vision model to a target task. We show that the PGN effectively adapts pretrained models to various new datasets: It surpasses previous methods by a large margin on 12/12 datasets and even outperforms full-finetuning on 5/12, while requiring 100x fewer parameters. Lastly, we introduce the ""prompt inversion"" trick, with which PGNs can be efficiently trained in a latent space but deployed in RGB input space for inference."
2210.06786,Evaluating the Label Efficiency of Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning   for Multi-Resolution Satellite Imagery,"The application of deep neural networks to remote sensing imagery is often constrained by the lack of ground-truth annotations. Adressing this issue requires models that generalize efficiently from limited amounts of labeled data, allowing us to tackle a wider range of Earth observation tasks. Another challenge in this domain is developing algorithms that operate at variable spatial resolutions, e.g., for the problem of classifying land use at different scales. Recently, self-supervised learning has been applied in the remote sensing domain to exploit readily-available unlabeled data, and was shown to reduce or even close the gap with supervised learning. In this paper, we study self-supervised visual representation learning through the lens of label efficiency, for the task of land use classification on multi-resolution/multi-scale satellite images. We benchmark two contrastive self-supervised methods adapted from Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and provide evidence that these methods can be perform effectively given little downstream supervision, where randomly initialized networks fail to generalize. Moreover, they outperform out-of-domain pretraining alternatives. We use the large-scale fMoW dataset to pretrain and evaluate the networks, and validate our observations with transfer to the RESISC45 dataset."
2210.07072,ConvTransSeg: A Multi-resolution Convolution-Transformer Network for   Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved the state-of-the-art performance in medical image segmentation due to their ability to extract highly complex feature representations. However, it is argued in recent studies that traditional CNNs lack the intelligence to capture long-term dependencies of different image regions. Following the success of applying Transformer models on natural language processing tasks, the medical image segmentation field has also witnessed growing interest in utilizing Transformers, due to their ability to capture long-range contextual information. However, unlike CNNs, Transformers lack the ability to learn local feature representations. Thus, to fully utilize the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder segmentation model (ConvTransSeg). It consists of a multi-layer CNN as the encoder for feature learning and the corresponding multi-level Transformer as the decoder for segmentation prediction. The encoder and decoder are interconnected in a multi-resolution manner. We compared our method with many other state-of-the-art hybrid CNN and Transformer segmentation models on binary and multiple class image segmentation tasks using several public medical image datasets, including skin lesion, polyp, cell and brain tissue. The experimental results show that our method achieves overall the best performance in terms of Dice coefficient and average symmetric surface distance measures with low model complexity and memory consumption. In contrast to most Transformer-based methods that we compared, our method does not require the use of pre-trained models to achieve similar or better performance. The code is freely available for research purposes on Github: (the link will be added upon acceptance)."
2210.07182,PDEBENCH: An Extensive Benchmark for Scientific Machine Learning,"Machine learning-based modeling of physical systems has experienced increased interest in recent years. Despite some impressive progress, there is still a lack of benchmarks for Scientific ML that are easy to use but still challenging and representative of a wide range of problems. We introduce PDEBench, a benchmark suite of time-dependent simulation tasks based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PDEBench comprises both code and data to benchmark the performance of novel machine learning models against both classical numerical simulations and machine learning baselines. Our proposed set of benchmark problems contribute the following unique features: (1) A much wider range of PDEs compared to existing benchmarks, ranging from relatively common examples to more realistic and difficult problems; (2) much larger ready-to-use datasets compared to prior work, comprising multiple simulation runs across a larger number of initial and boundary conditions and PDE parameters; (3) more extensible source codes with user-friendly APIs for data generation and baseline results with popular machine learning models (FNO, U-Net, PINN, Gradient-Based Inverse Method). PDEBench allows researchers to extend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and to compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods. We also propose new evaluation metrics with the aim to provide a more holistic understanding of learning methods in the context of Scientific ML. With those metrics we identify tasks which are challenging for recent ML methods and propose these tasks as future challenges for the community. The code is available at https://github.com/pdebench/PDEBench."
2210.07481,InFIP: An Explainable DNN Intellectual Property Protection Method based   on Intrinsic Features,"Intellectual property (IP) protection for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has raised serious concerns in recent years. Most existing works embed watermarks in the DNN model for IP protection, which need to modify the model and lack of interpretability. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an interpretable intellectual property protection method for DNN based on explainable artificial intelligence. Compared with existing works, the proposed method does not modify the DNN model, and the decision of the ownership verification is interpretable. We extract the intrinsic features of the DNN model by using Deep Taylor Decomposition. Since the intrinsic feature is composed of unique interpretation of the model's decision, the intrinsic feature can be regarded as fingerprint of the model. If the fingerprint of a suspected model is the same as the original model, the suspected model is considered as a pirated model. Experimental results demonstrate that the fingerprints can be successfully used to verify the ownership of the model and the test accuracy of the model is not affected. Furthermore, the proposed method is robust to fine-tuning attack, pruning attack, watermark overwriting attack, and adaptive attack."
2210.07539,Superpixel perception graph neural network for intelligent defect   detection of aero-engine blade,"Aero-engine is the core component of aircraft and other spacecraft. The high-speed rotating blades provide power by sucking in air and fully combusting, and various defects will inevitably occur, threatening the operation safety of aero-engine. Therefore, regular inspections are essential for such a complex system. However, existing traditional technology which is borescope inspection is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and experience-dependent. To endow this technology with intelligence, a novel superpixel perception graph neural network (SPGNN) is proposed by utilizing a multi-stage graph convolutional network (MSGCN) for feature extraction and superpixel perception region proposal network (SPRPN) for region proposal. First, to capture complex and irregular textures, the images are transformed into a series of patches, to obtain their graph representations. Then, MSGCN composed of several GCN blocks extracts graph structure features and performs graph information processing at graph level. Last but not least, the SPRPN is proposed to generate perceptual bounding boxes by fusing graph representation features and superpixel perception features. Therefore, the proposed SPGNN always implements feature extraction and information transmission at the graph level in the whole SPGNN pipeline, to alleviate the reduction of receptive field and information loss. To verify the effectiveness of SPGNN, we construct a simulated blade dataset with 3000 images. A public aluminum dataset is also used to validate the performances of different methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGNN has superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
2210.07675,Learning image representations for anomaly detection: application to   discovery of histological alterations in drug development,"We present a system for anomaly detection in histopathological images. In histology, normal samples are usually abundant, whereas anomalous (pathological) cases are scarce or not available. Under such settings, one-class classifiers trained on healthy data can detect out-of-distribution anomalous samples. Such approaches combined with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) representations of images were previously employed for anomaly detection (AD). However, pre-trained off-the-shelf CNN representations may not be sensitive to abnormal conditions in tissues, while natural variations of healthy tissue may result in distant representations. To adapt representations to relevant details in healthy tissue we propose training a CNN on an auxiliary task that discriminates healthy tissue of different species, organs, and staining reagents. Almost no additional labeling workload is required, since healthy samples come automatically with aforementioned labels. During training we enforce compact image representations with a center-loss term, which further improves representations for AD. The proposed system outperforms established AD methods on a published dataset of liver anomalies. Moreover, it provided comparable results to conventional methods specifically tailored for quantification of liver anomalies. We show that our approach can be used for toxicity assessment of candidate drugs at early development stages and thereby may reduce expensive late-stage drug attrition."
2210.08117,An Improved Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Visual-Inertial   Odometry,"Fast pose estimation (PE) is of vital importance for successful mission performance of agile autonomous robots. Global Positioning Systems such as GPS and GNSS have been typically used in fusion with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for PE. However, the low update rate and lack of proper signals make their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed. To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about six times faster and at least 20% more accurate in final position estimation than the standard MSCKF algorithm."
2210.08159,Dynamics-aware Adversarial Attack of Adaptive Neural Networks,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamics-aware adversarial attack problem of adaptive neural networks. Most existing adversarial attack algorithms are designed under a basic assumption -- the network architecture is fixed throughout the attack process. However, this assumption does not hold for many recently proposed adaptive neural networks, which adaptively deactivate unnecessary execution units based on inputs to improve computational efficiency. It results in a serious issue of lagged gradient, making the learned attack at the current step ineffective due to the architecture change afterward. To address this issue, we propose a Leaded Gradient Method (LGM) and show the significant effects of the lagged gradient. More specifically, we reformulate the gradients to be aware of the potential dynamic changes of network architectures, so that the learned attack better ""leads"" the next step than the dynamics-unaware methods when network architecture changes dynamically. Extensive experiments on representative types of adaptive neural networks for both 2D images and 3D point clouds show that our LGM achieves impressive adversarial attack performance compared with the dynamic-unaware attack methods. Code is available at https://github.com/antao97/LGM."
2210.08457,Scratching Visual Transformer's Back with Uniform Attention,"The favorable performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is often attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA). The MSA enables global interactions at each layer of a ViT model, which is a contrasting feature against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that gradually increase the range of interaction across multiple layers. We study the role of the density of the attention. Our preliminary analyses suggest that the spatial interactions of attention maps are close to dense interactions rather than sparse ones. This is a curious phenomenon, as dense attention maps are harder for the model to learn due to steeper softmax gradients around them. We interpret this as a strong preference for ViT models to include dense interaction. We thus manually insert the uniform attention to each layer of ViT models to supply the much needed dense interactions. We call this method Context Broadcasting, CB. We observe that the inclusion of CB reduces the degree of density in the original attention maps and increases both the capacity and generalizability of the ViT models. CB incurs negligible costs: 1 line in your model code, no additional parameters, and minimal extra operations."
2210.08518,OST: Efficient One-stream Network for 3D Single Object Tracking in Point   Clouds,"Although recent Siamese network-based trackers have achieved impressive perceptual accuracy for single object tracking in LiDAR point clouds, they usually utilized heavy correlation operations to capture category-level characteristics only, and overlook the inherent merit of arbitrariness in contrast to multiple object tracking. In this work, we propose a radically novel one-stream network with the strength of the instance-level encoding, which avoids the correlation operations occurring in previous Siamese network, thus considerably reducing the computational effort. In particular, the proposed method mainly consists of a Template-aware Transformer Module (TTM) and a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation (MFA) module capable of fusing spatial and semantic information. The TTM stitches the specified template and the search region together and leverages an attention mechanism to establish the information flow, breaking the previous pattern of independent \textit{extraction-and-correlation}. As a result, this module makes it possible to directly generate template-aware features that are suitable for the arbitrary and continuously changing nature of the target, enabling the model to deal with unseen categories. In addition, the MFA is proposed to make spatial and semantic information complementary to each other, which is characterized by reverse directional feature propagation that aggregates information from shallow to deep layers. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our method has achieved considerable performance not only for class-specific tracking but also for class-agnostic tracking with less computation and higher efficiency."
2210.08714,Selective Query-guided Debiasing for Video Corpus Moment Retrieval,"Video moment retrieval (VMR) aims to localize target moments in untrimmed videos pertinent to a given textual query. Existing retrieval systems tend to rely on retrieval bias as a shortcut and thus, fail to sufficiently learn multi-modal interactions between query and video. This retrieval bias stems from learning frequent co-occurrence patterns between query and moments, which spuriously correlate objects (e.g., a pencil) referred in the query with moments (e.g., scene of writing with a pencil) where the objects frequently appear in the video, such that they converge into biased moment predictions. Although recent debiasing methods have focused on removing this retrieval bias, we argue that these biased predictions sometimes should be preserved because there are many queries where biased predictions are rather helpful. To conjugate this retrieval bias, we propose a Selective Query-guided Debiasing network (SQuiDNet), which incorporates the following two main properties: (1) Biased Moment Retrieval that intentionally uncovers the biased moments inherent in objects of the query and (2) Selective Query-guided Debiasing that performs selective debiasing guided by the meaning of the query. Our experimental results on three moment retrieval benchmarks (i.e., TVR, ActivityNet, DiDeMo) show the effectiveness of SQuiDNet and qualitative analysis shows improved interpretability."
2210.08868,Cerebrovascular Segmentation via Vessel Oriented Filtering Network,"Accurate cerebrovascular segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is of great significance in diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular pathology. Due to the complexity and topology variability of blood vessels, complete and accurate segmentation of vascular network is still a challenge. In this paper, we proposed a Vessel Oriented Filtering Network (VOF-Net) which embeds domain knowledge into the convolutional neural network. We design oriented filters for blood vessels according to vessel orientation field, which is obtained by orientation estimation network. Features extracted by oriented filtering are injected into segmentation network, so as to make use of the prior information that the blood vessels are slender and curved tubular structure. Experimental results on datasets of CTA and MRA show that the proposed method is effective for vessel segmentation, and embedding the specific vascular filter improves the segmentation performance."
2210.09138,An Open-source Benchmark of Deep Learning Models for Audio-visual   Apparent and Self-reported Personality Recognition,"Personality determines a wide variety of human daily and working behaviours, and is crucial for understanding human internal and external states. In recent years, a large number of automatic personality computing approaches have been developed to predict either the apparent personality or self-reported personality of the subject based on non-verbal audio-visual behaviours. However, the majority of them suffer from complex and dataset-specific pre-processing steps and model training tricks. In the absence of a standardized benchmark with consistent experimental settings, it is not only impossible to fairly compare the real performances of these personality computing models but also makes them difficult to be reproduced. In this paper, we present the first reproducible audio-visual benchmarking framework to provide a fair and consistent evaluation of eight existing personality computing models (e.g., audio, visual and audio-visual) and seven standard deep learning models on both self-reported and apparent personality recognition tasks. Building upon a set of benchmarked models, we also investigate the impact of two previously-used long-term modelling strategies for summarising short-term/frame-level predictions on personality computing results. The results conclude: (i) apparent personality traits, inferred from facial behaviours by most benchmarked deep learning models, show more reliability than self-reported ones; (ii) visual models frequently achieved superior performances than audio models on personality recognition; (iii) non-verbal behaviours contribute differently in predicting different personality traits; and (iv) our reproduced personality computing models generally achieved worse performances than their original reported results. Our benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/liaorongfan/DeepPersonality}."
2210.09248,Provable Phase Retrieval with Mirror Descent,"In this paper, we consider the problem of phase retrieval, which consists of recovering an $n$-dimensional real vector from the magnitude of its $m$ linear measurements. We propose a mirror descent (or Bregman gradient descent) algorithm based on a wisely chosen Bregman divergence, hence allowing to remove the classical global Lipschitz continuity requirement on the gradient of the non-convex phase retrieval objective to be minimized. We apply the mirror descent for two random measurements: the \iid standard Gaussian and those obtained by multiple structured illuminations through Coded Diffraction Patterns (CDP). For the Gaussian case, we show that when the number of measurements $m$ is large enough, then with high probability, for almost all initializers, the algorithm recovers the original vector up to a global sign change. For both measurements, the mirror descent exhibits a local linear convergence behaviour with a dimension-independent convergence rate. Our theoretical results are finally illustrated with various numerical experiments, including an application to the reconstruction of images in precision optics."
2210.09292,Efficient Diffusion Models for Vision: A Survey,"Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in content generation without requiring adversarial training. These models are trained using a two-step process. First, a forward - diffusion - process gradually adds noise to a datum (usually an image). Then, a backward - reverse diffusion - process gradually removes the noise to turn it into a sample of the target distribution being modelled. DMs are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and have inherent high computational complexity. Due to the frequent function evaluations and gradient calculations in high-dimensional spaces, these models incur considerable computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This can not only preclude the democratization of diffusion-based modelling, but also hinder the adaption of diffusion models in real-life applications. Not to mention, the efficiency of computational models is fast becoming a significant concern due to excessive energy consumption and environmental scares. These factors have led to multiple contributions in the literature that focus on devising computationally efficient DMs. In this review, we present the most recent advances in diffusion models for vision, specifically focusing on the important design aspects that affect the computational efficiency of DMs. In particular, we emphasize the recently proposed design choices that have led to more efficient DMs. Unlike the other recent reviews, which discuss diffusion models from a broad perspective, this survey is aimed at pushing this research direction forward by highlighting the design strategies in the literature that are resulting in practicable models for the broader research community. We also provide a future outlook of diffusion models in vision from their computational efficiency viewpoint."
2210.09573,ViTCoD: Vision Transformer Acceleration via Dedicated Algorithm and   Accelerator Co-Design,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks. However, ViTs' self-attention module is still arguably a major bottleneck, limiting their achievable hardware efficiency. Meanwhile, existing accelerators dedicated to NLP Transformers are not optimal for ViTs. This is because there is a large difference between ViTs and NLP Transformers: ViTs have a relatively fixed number of input tokens, whose attention maps can be pruned by up to 90% even with fixed sparse patterns; while NLP Transformers need to handle input sequences of varying numbers of tokens and rely on on-the-fly predictions of dynamic sparse attention patterns for each input to achieve a decent sparsity (e.g., >=50%). To this end, we propose a dedicated algorithm and accelerator co-design framework dubbed ViTCoD for accelerating ViTs. Specifically, on the algorithm level, ViTCoD prunes and polarizes the attention maps to have either denser or sparser fixed patterns for regularizing two levels of workloads without hurting the accuracy, largely reducing the attention computations while leaving room for alleviating the remaining dominant data movements; on top of that, we further integrate a lightweight and learnable auto-encoder module to enable trading the dominant high-cost data movements for lower-cost computations. On the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to simultaneously coordinate the enforced denser/sparser workloads and encoder/decoder engines for boosted hardware utilization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTCoD largely reduces the dominant data movement costs, achieving speedups of up to 235.3x, 142.9x, 86.0x, 10.1x, and 6.8x over general computing platforms CPUs, EdgeGPUs, GPUs, and prior-art Transformer accelerators SpAtten and Sanger under an attention sparsity of 90%, respectively."
2210.09604,Perceptual Multi-Exposure Fusion,"As an ever-increasing demand for high dynamic range (HDR) scene shooting, multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) technology has abounded. In recent years, multi-scale exposure fusion approaches based on detail-enhancement have led the way for improvement in highlight and shadow details. Most of such methods, however, are too computationally expensive to be deployed on mobile devices. This paper presents a perceptual multi-exposure fusion method that not just ensures fine shadow/highlight details but with lower complexity than detailenhanced methods. We analyze the potential defects of three classical exposure measures in lieu of using detail-enhancement component and improve two of them, namely adaptive Wellexposedness (AWE) and the gradient of color images (3-D gradient). AWE designed in YCbCr color space considers the difference between varying exposure images. 3-D gradient is employed to extract fine details. We build a large-scale multiexposure benchmark dataset suitable for static scenes, which contains 167 image sequences all told. Experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method exceeds existing eight state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visually and MEF-SSIM value. Moreover, our approach can achieve a better improvement for current image enhancement techniques, ensuring fine detail in bright light."
2210.09655,WINE: Wavelet-Guided GAN Inversion and Editing for High-Fidelity   Refinement,"Recent advanced GAN inversion models aim to convey high-fidelity information from original images to generators through methods using generator tuning or high-dimensional feature learning. Despite these efforts, accurately reconstructing image-specific details remains as a challenge due to the inherent limitations both in terms of training and structural aspects, leading to a bias towards low-frequency information. In this paper, we look into the widely used pixel loss in GAN inversion, revealing its predominant focus on the reconstruction of low-frequency features. We then propose WINE, a Wavelet-guided GAN Inversion aNd Editing model, which transfers the high-frequency information through wavelet coefficients via newly proposed wavelet loss and wavelet fusion scheme. Notably, WINE is the first attempt to interpret GAN inversion in the frequency domain. Our experimental results showcase the precision of WINE in preserving high-frequency details and enhancing image quality. Even in editing scenarios, WINE outperforms existing state-of-the-art GAN inversion models with a fine balance between editability and reconstruction quality."
2210.09846,G-PECNet: Towards a Generalizable Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction   System,"Navigating dynamic physical environments without obstructing or damaging human assets is of quintessential importance for social robots. In this work, we solve autonomous drone navigation's sub-problem of predicting out-of-domain human and agent trajectories using a deep generative model. Our method: General-PECNet or G-PECNet observes an improvement of 9.5\% on the Final Displacement Error (FDE) on 2020's benchmark: PECNet through a combination of architectural improvements inspired by periodic activation functions and synthetic trajectory (data) augmentations using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Additionally, we propose a simple geometry-inspired metric for trajectory non-linearity and outlier detection, helpful for the task. Code available at https://github.com/Aryan-Garg/PECNet-Pedestrian-Trajectory-Prediction.git"
2210.09879,Unsupervised visualization of image datasets using contrastive learning,"Visualization methods based on the nearest neighbor graph, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. Yet, these approaches only produce meaningful results if the nearest neighbors themselves are meaningful. For images represented in pixel space this is not the case, as distances in pixel space are often not capturing our sense of similarity and therefore neighbors are not semantically close. This problem can be circumvented by self-supervised approaches based on contrastive learning, such as SimCLR, relying on data augmentation to generate implicit neighbors, but these methods do not produce two-dimensional embeddings suitable for visualization. Here, we present a new method, called t-SimCNE, for unsupervised visualization of image data. T-SimCNE combines ideas from contrastive learning and neighbor embeddings, and trains a parametric mapping from the high-dimensional pixel space into two dimensions. We show that the resulting 2D embeddings achieve classification accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art high-dimensional SimCLR representations, thus faithfully capturing semantic relationships. Using t-SimCNE, we obtain informative visualizations of the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, showing rich cluster structure and highlighting artifacts and outliers."
2210.09969,Transfer-learning for video classification: Video Swin Transformer on   multiple domains,"The computer vision community has seen a shift from convolutional-based to pure transformer architectures for both image and video tasks. Training a transformer from zero for these tasks usually requires a lot of data and computational resources. Video Swin Transformer (VST) is a pure-transformer model developed for video classification which achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and efficiency on several datasets. In this paper, we aim to understand if VST generalizes well enough to be used in an out-of-domain setting. We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely FCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from Kinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch. We then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in which scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable. Our experiments show an 85\% top-1 accuracy on FCVID without retraining the whole model which is equal to the state-of-the-art for the dataset and a 21\% accuracy on Something-Something. The experiments also suggest that the performance of the VST decreases on average when the video duration increases which seems to be a consequence of a design choice of the model. From the results, we conclude that VST generalizes well enough to classify out-of-domain videos without retraining when the target classes are from the same type as the classes used to train the model. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400 to FCVID, where most datasets target mostly objects. On the other hand, if the classes are not from the same type, then the accuracy after the transfer-learning approach is expected to be poor. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400, where the classes represent mostly objects, to Something-Something, where the classes represent mostly actions."
2210.10233,Vision-Based Robust Lane Detection and Tracking under Different   Challenging Environmental Conditions,"Lane marking detection is fundamental for both advanced driving assistance systems. However, detecting lane is highly challenging when the visibility of a road lane marking is low due to real-life challenging environment and adverse weather. Most of the lane detection methods suffer from four types of challenges: (i) light effects i.e., shadow, glare of light, reflection etc.; (ii) Obscured visibility of eroded, blurred, colored and cracked lane caused by natural disasters and adverse weather; (iii) lane marking occlusion by different objects from surroundings (wiper, vehicles etc.); and (iv) presence of confusing lane like lines inside the lane view e.g., guardrails, pavement marking, road divider etc. Here, we propose a robust lane detection and tracking method with three key technologies. First, we introduce a comprehensive intensity threshold range (CITR) to improve the performance of the canny operator in detecting low intensity lane edges. Second, we propose a two-step lane verification technique, the angle based geometric constraint (AGC) and length-based geometric constraint (LGC) followed by Hough Transform, to verify the characteristics of lane marking and to prevent incorrect lane detection. Finally, we propose a novel lane tracking technique, by defining a range of horizontal lane position (RHLP) along the x axis which will be updating with respect to the lane position of previous frame. It can keep track of the lane position when either left or right or both lane markings are partially and fully invisible. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we used the DSDLDE [1] and SLD [2] dataset with 1080x1920 and 480x720 resolutions at 24 and 25 frames/sec respectively. Experimental results show that the average detection rate is 97.55%, and the average processing time is 22.33 msec/frame, which outperform the state of-the-art method."
2210.10418,Physics-informed Variational Autoencoders for Improved Robustness to   Environmental Factors of Variation,"The combination of machine learning models with physical models is a recent research path to learn robust data representations. In this paper, we introduce p$^3$VAE, a variational autoencoder that integrates prior physical knowledge about the latent factors of variation that are related to the data acquisition conditions. p$^3$VAE combines standard neural network layers with non-trainable physics layers in order to partially ground the latent space to physical variables. We introduce a semi-supervised learning algorithm that strikes a balance between the machine learning part and the physics part. Experiments on simulated and real data sets demonstrate the benefits of our framework against competing physics-informed and conventional machine learning models, in terms of extrapolation capabilities and interpretability. In particular, we show that p$^3$VAE naturally has interesting disentanglement capabilities. Our code and data have been made publicly available at https://github.com/Romain3Ch216/p3VAE."
2210.10537,Online LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Parameters Self-checking,"With the development of neural networks and the increasing popularity of automatic driving, the calibration of the LiDAR and the camera has attracted more and more attention. This calibration task is multi-modal, where the rich color and texture information captured by the camera and the accurate three-dimensional spatial information from the LiDAR is incredibly significant for downstream tasks. Current research interests mainly focus on obtaining accurate calibration results through information fusion. However, they seldom analyze whether the calibrated results are correct or not, which could be of significant importance in real-world applications. For example, in large-scale production, the LiDARs and the cameras of each smart car have to get well-calibrated as the car leaves the production line, while in the rest of the car life period, the poses of the LiDARs and cameras should also get continually supervised to ensure the security. To this end, this paper proposes a self-checking algorithm to judge whether the extrinsic parameters are well-calibrated by introducing a binary classification network based on the fused information from the camera and the LiDAR. Moreover, since there is no such dataset for the task in this work, we further generate a new dataset branch from the KITTI dataset tailored for the task. Our experiments on the proposed dataset branch demonstrate the performance of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the significance of continually checking the calibrated extrinsic parameters for autonomous driving. The code is open-sourced on the Github website at https://github.com/OpenCalib/LiDAR2camera_self-check."
2210.10605,"Provably Convergent Plug & Play Linearized ADMM, applied to Deblurring   Spatially Varying Kernels","Plug & Play methods combine proximal algorithms with denoiser priors to solve inverse problems. These methods rely on the computability of the proximal operator of the data fidelity term. In this paper, we propose a Plug & Play framework based on linearized ADMM that allows us to bypass the computation of intractable proximal operators. We demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm and provide results on restoration tasks such as super-resolution and deblurring with non-uniform blur."
2210.10969,SSiT: Saliency-guided Self-supervised Image Transformer for Diabetic   Retinopathy Grading,"Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has been widely applied to learn image representations through exploiting unlabeled images. However, it has not been fully explored in the medical image analysis field. In this work, Saliency-guided Self-Supervised image Transformer (SSiT) is proposed for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading from fundus images. We novelly introduce saliency maps into SSL, with a goal of guiding self-supervised pre-training with domain-specific prior knowledge. Specifically, two saliency-guided learning tasks are employed in SSiT: (1) Saliency-guided contrastive learning is conducted based on the momentum contrast, wherein fundus images' saliency maps are utilized to remove trivial patches from the input sequences of the momentum-updated key encoder. Thus, the key encoder is constrained to provide target representations focusing on salient regions, guiding the query encoder to capture salient features. (2) The query encoder is trained to predict the saliency segmentation, encouraging the preservation of fine-grained information in the learned representations. To assess our proposed method, four publicly-accessible fundus image datasets are adopted. One dataset is employed for pre-training, while the three others are used to evaluate the pre-trained models' performance on downstream DR grading. The proposed SSiT significantly outperforms other representative state-of-the-art SSL methods on all downstream datasets and under various evaluation settings. For example, SSiT achieves a Kappa score of 81.88% on the DDR dataset under fine-tuning evaluation, outperforming all other ViT-based SSL methods by at least 9.48%."
2210.10981,MGTUNet: An new UNet for colon nuclei instance segmentation and   quantification,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three malignant tumor types in terms of morbidity and mortality. Histopathological images are the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. Cellular nuclei instance segmentation and classification, and nuclear component regression tasks can aid in the analysis of the tumor microenvironment in colon tissue. Traditional methods are still unable to handle both types of tasks end-to-end at the same time, and have poor prediction accuracy and high application costs. This paper proposes a new UNet model for handling nuclei based on the UNet framework, called MGTUNet, which uses Mish, Group normalization and transposed convolution layer to improve the segmentation model, and a ranger optimizer to adjust the SmoothL1Loss values. Secondly, it uses different channels to segment and classify different types of nucleus, ultimately completing the nuclei instance segmentation and classification task, and the nuclei component regression task simultaneously. Finally, we did extensive comparison experiments using eight segmentation models. By comparing the three evaluation metrics and the parameter sizes of the models, MGTUNet obtained 0.6254 on PQ, 0.6359 on mPQ, and 0.8695 on R2. Thus, the experiments demonstrated that MGTUNet is now a state-of-the-art method for quantifying histopathological images of colon cancer."
2210.11388,Physics-informed Deep Diffusion MRI Reconstruction with Synthetic Data:   Break Training Data Bottleneck in Artificial Intelligence,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only imaging modality for non-invasive movement detection of in vivo water molecules, with significant clinical and research applications. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) MRI acquired by multi-shot techniques can achieve higher resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, and lower geometric distortion than single-shot, but suffers from inter-shot motion-induced artifacts. These artifacts cannot be removed prospectively, leading to the absence of artifact-free training labels. Thus, the potential of deep learning in multi-shot DWI reconstruction remains largely untapped. To break the training data bottleneck, here, we propose a Physics-Informed Deep DWI reconstruction method (PIDD) to synthesize high-quality paired training data by leveraging the physical diffusion model (magnitude synthesis) and inter-shot motion-induced phase model (motion phase synthesis). The network is trained only once with 100,000 synthetic samples, achieving encouraging results on multiple realistic in vivo data reconstructions. Advantages over conventional methods include: (a) Better motion artifact suppression and reconstruction stability; (b) Outstanding generalization to multi-scenario reconstructions, including multi-resolution, multi-b-value, multi-under-sampling, multi-vendor, and multi-center; (c) Excellent clinical adaptability to patients with verifications by seven experienced doctors (p<0.001). In conclusion, PIDD presents a novel deep learning framework by exploiting the power of MRI physics, providing a cost-effective and explainable way to break the data bottleneck in deep learning medical imaging."
2210.11407,Similarity of Neural Architectures using Adversarial Attack   Transferability,"In recent years, many deep neural architectures have been developed for image classification. Whether they are similar or dissimilar and what factors contribute to their (dis)similarities remains curious. To address this question, we aim to design a quantitative and scalable similarity measure between neural architectures. We propose Similarity by Attack Transferability (SAT) from the observation that adversarial attack transferability contains information related to input gradients and decision boundaries widely used to understand model behaviors. We conduct a large-scale analysis on 69 state-of-the-art ImageNet classifiers using our proposed similarity function to answer the question. Moreover, we observe neural architecture-related phenomena using model similarity that model diversity can lead to better performance on model ensembles and knowledge distillation under specific conditions. Our results provide insights into why developing diverse neural architectures with distinct components is necessary."
2210.11456,MixMask: Revisiting Masking Strategy for Siamese ConvNets,"The recent progress in self-supervised learning has successfully combined Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Siamese Networks, harnessing the strengths of both methodologies. Nonetheless, certain challenges persist when integrating conventional erase-based masking within Siamese ConvNets. Two primary concerns are: (1) The continuous data processing nature of ConvNets, which doesn't allow for the exclusion of non-informative masked regions, leading to reduced training efficiency compared to ViT architecture; (2) The misalignment between erase-based masking and the contrastive-based objective, distinguishing it from the MIM technique. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel filling-based masking approach, termed \textbf{MixMask}. The proposed method replaces erased areas with content from a different image, effectively countering the information depletion seen in traditional masking methods. Additionally, we unveil an adaptive loss function that captures the semantics of the newly patched views, ensuring seamless integration within the architectural framework. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments across various datasets and application scenarios. The findings underscore our framework's enhanced performance in areas such as linear probing, semi-supervised and supervised finetuning, object detection and segmentation. Notably, our method surpasses the MSCN, establishing MixMask as a more advantageous masking solution for Siamese ConvNets. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/kirill-vish/MixMask."
2210.11470,i-MAE: Are Latent Representations in Masked Autoencoders Linearly   Separable?,"Masked image modeling (MIM) has been recognized as a strong self-supervised pre-training approach in the vision domain. However, the mechanism and properties of the learned representations by such a scheme, as well as how to further enhance the representations are so far not well-explored. In this paper, we aim to explore an interactive Masked Autoencoders (i-MAE) framework to enhance the representation capability from two aspects: (1) employing a two-way image reconstruction and a latent feature reconstruction with distillation loss to learn better features; (2) proposing a semantics-enhanced sampling strategy to boost the learned semantics in MAE. Upon the proposed i-MAE architecture, we can address two critical questions to explore the behaviors of the learned representations in MAE: (1) Whether the separability of latent representations in Masked Autoencoders is helpful for model performance? We study it by forcing the input as a mixture of two images instead of one. (2) Whether we can enhance the representations in the latent feature space by controlling the degree of semantics during sampling on Masked Autoencoders? To this end, we propose a sampling strategy within a mini-batch based on the semantics of training samples to examine this aspect. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K to verify the observations we discovered. Furthermore, in addition to qualitatively analyzing the characteristics of the latent representations, we examine the existence of linear separability and the degree of semantics in the latent space by proposing two evaluation schemes. The surprising and consistent results demonstrate that i-MAE is a superior framework design for understanding MAE frameworks, as well as achieving better representational ability. Code is available at https://github.com/vision-learning-acceleration-lab/i-mae."
2210.11663,InfraRed Investigation in Singapore (IRIS) Observatory: Urban heat   island contributors and mitigators analysis using neighborhood-scale thermal   imaging,"This paper studies heat fluxes from contributors and mitigators of urban heat islands using thermal images and weather data. Thermal images were collected from an observatory operating on the rooftop of a building between November 2021 and April 2022. Over the same period, an automatic weather station network was used to measure weather conditions at several locations on a university campus in Singapore. From data collected by the observatory and the automatic weather station network, a method was developed to estimate the heat emitted by building facades, vegetation, and traffic. Before performing the analysis of urban heat fluxes, it was observed that the surface temperature collected from the observatory is sensitive to some variables. After the sensitivity analysis, thermal images were calibrated against measurements of the surface temperature in an outdoor environment. Finally, several contributors and mitigators of urban heat islands were analyzed from heat fluxes assessed with thermal images and weather data. According to thermal images collected by the rooftop observatory, concrete walls are an important contributor to urban heat islands due to the longwave radiation they emit at night. Vegetation, on the other hand, seems to be an effective mitigator because of latent heat fluxes generated by evapotranspiration. Traffic looks to be a negligible source of heat if considered over a small portion of a road. In the future, more efforts can be made to estimate the magnitude of the heat released by an air-conditioning system from thermal images."
2210.11795,PoseScript: Linking 3D Human Poses and Natural Language,"Natural language plays a critical role in many computer vision applications, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval, to provide fine-grained semantic information. Unfortunately, while human pose is key to human understanding, current 3D human pose datasets lack detailed language descriptions. To address this issue, we have introduced the PoseScript dataset. This dataset pairs more than six thousand 3D human poses from AMASS with rich human-annotated descriptions of the body parts and their spatial relationships. Additionally, to increase the size of the dataset to a scale that is compatible with data-hungry learning algorithms, we have proposed an elaborate captioning process that generates automatic synthetic descriptions in natural language from given 3D keypoints. This process extracts low-level pose information, known as ""posecodes"", using a set of simple but generic rules on the 3D keypoints. These posecodes are then combined into higher level textual descriptions using syntactic rules. With automatic annotations, the amount of available data significantly scales up (100k), making it possible to effectively pretrain deep models for finetuning on human captions. To showcase the potential of annotated poses, we present three multi-modal learning tasks that utilize the PoseScript dataset. Firstly, we develop a pipeline that maps 3D poses and textual descriptions into a joint embedding space, allowing for cross-modal retrieval of relevant poses from large-scale datasets. Secondly, we establish a baseline for a text-conditioned model generating 3D poses. Thirdly, we present a learned process for generating pose descriptions. These applications demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of annotated poses in various tasks and pave the way for future research in the field."
2210.11815,Self-Supervised Pretraining on Satellite Imagery: a Case Study on   Label-Efficient Vehicle Detection,"In defense-related remote sensing applications, such as vehicle detection on satellite imagery, supervised learning requires a huge number of labeled examples to reach operational performances. Such data are challenging to obtain as it requires military experts, and some observables are intrinsically rare. This limited labeling capability, as well as the large number of unlabeled images available due to the growing number of sensors, make object detection on remote sensing imagery highly relevant for self-supervised learning. We study in-domain self-supervised representation learning for object detection on very high resolution optical satellite imagery, that is yet poorly explored. For the first time to our knowledge, we study the problem of label efficiency on this task. We use the large land use classification dataset Functional Map of the World to pretrain representations with an extension of the Momentum Contrast framework. We then investigate this model's transferability on a real-world task of fine-grained vehicle detection and classification on Preligens proprietary data, which is designed to be representative of an operational use case of strategic site surveillance. We show that our in-domain self-supervised learning model is competitive with ImageNet pretraining, and outperforms it in the low-label regime."
2210.12100,Boomerang: Local sampling on image manifolds using diffusion models,"The inference stage of diffusion models can be seen as running a reverse-time diffusion stochastic differential equation, where samples from a Gaussian latent distribution are transformed into samples from a target distribution that usually reside on a low-dimensional manifold, e.g., an image manifold. The intermediate values between the initial latent space and the image manifold can be interpreted as noisy images, with the amount of noise determined by the forward diffusion process noise schedule. We utilize this interpretation to present Boomerang, an approach for local sampling of image manifolds. As implied by its name, Boomerang local sampling involves adding noise to an input image, moving it closer to the latent space, and then mapping it back to the image manifold through a partial reverse diffusion process. Thus, Boomerang generates images on the manifold that are ``similar,'' but nonidentical, to the original input image. We can control the proximity of the generated images to the original by adjusting the amount of noise added. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of the reverse diffusion process in Boomerang, the generated images display a certain degree of stochasticity, allowing us to obtain local samples from the manifold without encountering any duplicates. Boomerang offers the flexibility to work seamlessly with any pretrained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, without necessitating any adjustments to the reverse diffusion process. We present three applications for Boomerang. First, we provide a framework for constructing privacy-preserving datasets having controllable degrees of anonymity. Second, we show that using Boomerang for data augmentation increases generalization performance and outperforms state-of-the-art synthetic data augmentation. Lastly, we introduce a perceptual image enhancement framework, which enables resolution enhancement."
2210.12241,FIND: An Unsupervised Implicit 3D Model of Articulated Human Feet,"In this paper we present a high fidelity and articulated 3D human foot model. The model is parameterised by a disentangled latent code in terms of shape, texture and articulated pose. While high fidelity models are typically created with strong supervision such as 3D keypoint correspondences or pre-registration, we focus on the difficult case of little to no annotation. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) we develop a Foot Implicit Neural Deformation field model, named FIND, capable of tailoring explicit meshes at any resolution i.e. for low or high powered devices; (ii) an approach for training our model in various modes of weak supervision with progressively better disentanglement as more labels, such as pose categories, are provided; (iii) a novel unsupervised part-based loss for fitting our model to 2D images which is better than traditional photometric or silhouette losses; (iv) finally, we release a new dataset of high resolution 3D human foot scans, Foot3D. On this dataset, we show our model outperforms a strong PCA implementation trained on the same data in terms of shape quality and part correspondences, and that our novel unsupervised part-based loss improves inference on images."
2210.12596,DMODE: Differential Monocular Object Distance Estimation Module without   Class Specific Information,"Utilizing a single camera for measuring object distances is a cost-effective alternative to stereo-vision and LiDAR. Although monocular distance estimation has been explored in the literature, most existing techniques rely on object class knowledge to achieve high performance. Without this contextual data, monocular distance estimation becomes more challenging, lacking reference points and object-specific cues. However, these cues can be misleading for objects with wide-range variation or adversarial situations, which is a challenging aspect of object-agnostic distance estimation. In this paper, we propose DMODE, a class-agnostic method for monocular distance estimation that does not require object class knowledge. DMODE estimates an object's distance by fusing its fluctuation in size over time with the camera's motion, making it adaptable to various object detectors and unknown objects, thus addressing these challenges. We evaluate our model on the KITTI MOTS dataset using ground-truth bounding box annotations and outputs from TrackRCNN and EagerMOT. The object's location is determined using the change in bounding box sizes and camera position without measuring the object's detection source or class attributes. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-class object distance detection scenarios compared to conventional methods."
2210.13004,Efficient Representation of Natural Image Patches,"Utilizing an abstract information processing model based on minimal yet realistic assumptions inspired by biological systems, we study how to achieve the early visual system's two ultimate objectives: efficient information transmission and accurate sensor probability distribution modeling. We prove that optimizing for information transmission does not guarantee optimal probability distribution modeling in general. We illustrate, using a two-pixel (2D) system and image patches, that an efficient representation can be realized through a nonlinear population code driven by two types of biologically plausible loss functions that depend solely on output. After unsupervised learning, our abstract information processing model bears remarkable resemblances to biological systems, despite not mimicking many features of real neurons, such as spiking activity. A preliminary comparison with a contemporary deep learning model suggests that our model offers a significant efficiency advantage. Our model provides novel insights into the computational theory of early visual systems as well as a potential new approach to enhance the efficiency of deep learning models."
2210.13012,CMU-Net: A Strong ConvMixer-based Medical Ultrasound Image Segmentation   Network,"U-Net and its extensions have achieved great success in medical image segmentation. However, due to the inherent local characteristics of ordinary convolution operations, U-Net encoder cannot effectively extract global context information. In addition, simple skip connections cannot capture salient features. In this work, we propose a fully convolutional segmentation network (CMU-Net) which incorporates hybrid convolutions and multi-scale attention gate. The ConvMixer module extracts global context information by mixing features at distant spatial locations. Moreover, the multi-scale attention gate emphasizes valuable features and achieves efficient skip connections. We evaluate the proposed method using both breast ultrasound datasets and a thyroid ultrasound image dataset; and CMU-Net achieves average Intersection over Union (IoU) values of 73.27% and 84.75%, and F1 scores of 84.81% and 91.71%. The code is available at https://github.com/FengheTan9/CMU-Net."
2210.13167,Exploring Self-Attention for Crop-type Classification Explainability,"Transformer models have become a promising approach for crop-type classification. Although their attention weights can be used to understand the relevant time points for crop disambiguation, the validity of these insights depends on how closely the attention weights approximate the actual workings of these black-box models, which is not always clear. In this paper, we introduce a novel explainability framework that systematically evaluates the explanatory power of the attention weights of a standard transformer encoder for crop-type classification. Our results show that attention patterns strongly relate to key dates, which are often associated with critical phenological events for crop-type classification. Further, the sensitivity analysis reveals the limited capability of the attention weights to characterize crop phenology as the identified phenological events depend on the other crops considered during training. This limitation highlights the relevance of future work towards the development of deep learning approaches capable of automatically learning the temporal vegetation dynamics for accurate crop disambiguation"
2210.13452,MetaFormer Baselines for Vision,"MetaFormer, the abstracted architecture of Transformer, has been found to play a significant role in achieving competitive performance. In this paper, we further explore the capacity of MetaFormer, again, without focusing on token mixer design: we introduce several baseline models under MetaFormer using the most basic or common mixers, and summarize our observations as follows: (1) MetaFormer ensures solid lower bound of performance. By merely adopting identity mapping as the token mixer, the MetaFormer model, termed IdentityFormer, achieves >80% accuracy on ImageNet-1K. (2) MetaFormer works well with arbitrary token mixers. When specifying the token mixer as even a random matrix to mix tokens, the resulting model RandFormer yields an accuracy of >81%, outperforming IdentityFormer. Rest assured of MetaFormer's results when new token mixers are adopted. (3) MetaFormer effortlessly offers state-of-the-art results. With just conventional token mixers dated back five years ago, the models instantiated from MetaFormer already beat state of the art. (a) ConvFormer outperforms ConvNeXt. Taking the common depthwise separable convolutions as the token mixer, the model termed ConvFormer, which can be regarded as pure CNNs, outperforms the strong CNN model ConvNeXt. (b) CAFormer sets new record on ImageNet-1K. By simply applying depthwise separable convolutions as token mixer in the bottom stages and vanilla self-attention in the top stages, the resulting model CAFormer sets a new record on ImageNet-1K: it achieves an accuracy of 85.5% at 224x224 resolution, under normal supervised training without external data or distillation. In our expedition to probe MetaFormer, we also find that a new activation, StarReLU, reduces 71% FLOPs of activation compared with GELU yet achieves better performance. We expect StarReLU to find great potential in MetaFormer-like models alongside other neural networks."
2210.13512,Provably Learning Diverse Features in Multi-View Data with Midpoint   Mixup,"Mixup is a data augmentation technique that relies on training using random convex combinations of data points and their labels. In recent years, Mixup has become a standard primitive used in the training of state-of-the-art image classification models due to its demonstrated benefits over empirical risk minimization with regards to generalization and robustness. In this work, we try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have multiple associated features (or views) that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings of image benchmarks modified to have multiple features."
2210.13570,Strong-TransCenter: Improved Multi-Object Tracking based on Transformers   with Dense Representations,"Transformer networks have been a focus of research in many fields in recent years, being able to surpass the state-of-the-art performance in different computer vision tasks. However, in the task of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), leveraging the power of Transformers remains relatively unexplored. Among the pioneering efforts in this domain, TransCenter, a Transformer-based MOT architecture with dense object queries, demonstrated exceptional tracking capabilities while maintaining reasonable runtime. Nonetheless, one critical aspect in MOT, track displacement estimation, presents room for enhancement to further reduce association errors. In response to this challenge, our paper introduces a novel improvement to TransCenter. We propose a post-processing mechanism grounded in the Track-by-Detection paradigm, aiming to refine the track displacement estimation. Our approach involves the integration of a carefully designed Kalman filter, which incorporates Transformer outputs into measurement error estimation, and the use of an embedding network for target re-identification. This combined strategy yields substantial improvement in the accuracy and robustness of the tracking process. We validate our contributions through comprehensive experiments on the MOTChallenge datasets MOT17 and MOT20, where our proposed approach outperforms other Transformer-based trackers. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/amitgalor18/STC_Tracker"
2210.13654,Boosting Kidney Stone Identification in Endoscopic Images Using Two-Step   Transfer Learning,"Knowing the cause of kidney stone formation is crucial to establish treatments that prevent recurrence. There are currently different approaches for determining the kidney stone type. However, the reference ex-vivo identification procedure can take up to several weeks, while an in-vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. Machine learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an automated classification of kidney stones during an ureteroscopy; however, there is a general lack in terms of quality of the training data and methods. In this work, a two-step transfer learning approach is used to train the kidney stone classifier. The proposed approach transfers knowledge learned on a set of images of kidney stones acquired with a CCD camera (ex-vivo dataset) to a final model that classifies images from endoscopic images (ex-vivo dataset). The results show that learning features from different domains with similar information helps to improve the performance of a model that performs classification in real conditions (for instance, uncontrolled lighting conditions and blur). Finally, in comparison to models that are trained from scratch or by initializing ImageNet weights, the obtained results suggest that the two-step approach extracts features improving the identification of kidney stones in endoscopic images."
2210.13664,Mitigating Gender Bias in Face Recognition Using the von Mises-Fisher   Mixture Model,"In spite of the high performance and reliability of deep learning algorithms in a wide range of everyday applications, many investigations tend to show that a lot of models exhibit biases, discriminating against specific subgroups of the population (e.g. gender, ethnicity). This urges the practitioner to develop fair systems with a uniform/comparable performance across sensitive groups. In this work, we investigate the gender bias of deep Face Recognition networks. In order to measure this bias, we introduce two new metrics, $\mathrm{BFAR}$ and $\mathrm{BFRR}$, that better reflect the inherent deployment needs of Face Recognition systems. Motivated by geometric considerations, we mitigate gender bias through a new post-processing methodology which transforms the deep embeddings of a pre-trained model to give more representation power to discriminated subgroups. It consists in training a shallow neural network by minimizing a Fair von Mises-Fisher loss whose hyperparameters account for the intra-class variance of each gender. Interestingly, we empirically observe that these hyperparameters are correlated with our fairness metrics. In fact, extensive numerical experiments on a variety of datasets show that a careful selection significantly reduces gender bias. The code used for the experiments can be found at https://github.com/JRConti/EthicalModule_vMF."
2210.13723,S3E: A Multi-Robot Multimodal Dataset for Collaborative SLAM,"The burgeoning demand for collaborative robotic systems to execute complex tasks collectively has intensified the research community's focus on advancing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in a cooperative context. Despite this interest, the scalability and diversity of existing datasets for collaborative trajectories remain limited, especially in scenarios with constrained perspectives where the generalization capabilities of Collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM) are critical for the feasibility of multi-agent missions. Addressing this gap, we introduce S3E, an expansive multimodal dataset. Captured by a fleet of unmanned ground vehicles traversing four distinct collaborative trajectory paradigms, S3E encompasses 13 outdoor and 5 indoor sequences. These sequences feature meticulously synchronized and spatially calibrated data streams, including 360-degree LiDAR point cloud, high-resolution stereo imagery, high-frequency inertial measurement units (IMU), and Ultra-wideband (UWB) relative observations. Our dataset not only surpasses previous efforts in scale, scene diversity, and data intricacy but also provides a thorough analysis and benchmarks for both collaborative and individual SLAM methodologies.

2210.13984,Inferring Past Human Actions in Homes with Abductive Reasoning,"Abductive reasoning aims to make the most likely inference for a given set of incomplete observations. In this paper, we introduce ""Abductive Past Action Inference"", a novel research task aimed at identifying the past actions performed by individuals within homes to reach specific states captured in a single image, using abductive inference. The research explores three key abductive inference problems: past action set prediction, past action sequence prediction, and abductive past action verification. We introduce several models tailored for abductive past action inference, including a relational graph neural network, a relational bilinear pooling model, and a relational transformer model. Notably, the newly proposed object-relational bilinear graph encoder-decoder (BiGED) model emerges as the most effective among all methods evaluated, demonstrating good proficiency in handling the intricacies of the Action Genome dataset. The contributions of this research significantly advance the ability of deep learning models to reason about current scene evidence and make highly plausible inferences about past human actions. This advancement enables a deeper understanding of events and behaviors, which can enhance decision-making and improve system capabilities across various real-world applications such as Human-Robot Interaction and Elderly Care and Health Monitoring.

2210.14164,Understanding Key Point Cloud Features for Development Three-dimensional   Adversarial Attacks,"Adversarial attacks pose serious challenges for deep neural network (DNN)-based analysis of various input signals. In the case of three-dimensional point clouds, methods have been developed to identify points that play a key role in network decision, and these become crucial in generating existing adversarial attacks. For example, a saliency map approach is a popular method for identifying adversarial drop points, whose removal would significantly impact the network decision. This paper seeks to enhance the understanding of three-dimensional adversarial attacks by exploring which point cloud features are most important for predicting adversarial points. Specifically, Fourteen key point cloud features such as edge intensity and distance from the centroid are defined, and multiple linear regression is employed to assess their predictive power for adversarial points. Based on critical feature selection insights, a new attack method has been developed to evaluate whether the selected features can generate an attack successfully. Unlike traditional attack methods that rely on model-specific vulnerabilities, this approach focuses on the intrinsic characteristics of the point clouds themselves. It is demonstrated that these features can predict adversarial points across four different DNN architectures, Point Network (PointNet), PointNet++, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN), and Point Convolutional Network (PointConv) outperforming random guessing and achieving results comparable to saliency map-based attacks. This study has important engineering applications, such as enhancing the security and robustness of three-dimensional point cloud-based systems in fields like robotics and autonomous driving."
2210.14219,Redistributor: Transforming Empirical Data Distributions,"We present an algorithm and package, Redistributor, which forces a collection of scalar samples to follow a desired distribution. When given independent and identically distributed samples of some random variable $S$ and the continuous cumulative distribution function of some desired target $T$, it provably produces a consistent estimator of the transformation $R$ which satisfies $R(S)=T$ in distribution. As the distribution of $S$ or $T$ may be unknown, we also include algorithms for efficiently estimating these distributions from samples. This allows for various interesting use cases in image processing, where Redistributor serves as a remarkably simple and easy-to-use tool that is capable of producing visually appealing results. For color correction it outperforms other model-based methods and excels in achieving photorealistic style transfer, surpassing deep learning methods in content preservation. The package is implemented in Python and is optimized to efficiently handle large datasets, making it also suitable as a preprocessing step in machine learning. The source code is available at https://github.com/paloha/redistributor."
2210.14416,Residual Back Projection With Untrained Neural Networks,"Background and Objective: The success of neural networks in a number of image processing tasks has motivated their application in image reconstruction problems in computed tomography (CT). While progress has been made in this area, the lack of stability and theoretical guarantees for accuracy, together with the scarcity of high-quality training data for specific imaging domains pose challenges for many CT applications. In this paper, we present a framework for iterative reconstruction (IR) in CT that leverages the hierarchical structure of neural networks, without the need for training. Our framework incorporates this structural information as a deep image prior (DIP), and uses a novel residual back projection (RBP) connection that forms the basis for our iterations.   Methods: We propose using an untrained U-net in conjunction with a novel residual back projection to minimize an objective function and achieve high-accuracy reconstruction. In each iteration, the weights of the untrained U-net are optimized, and the output of the U-net in the current iteration is used to update the input of the U-net in the next iteration through the aforementioned RBP connection.   Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the RBP-DIP framework offers improvements over other state-of-the-art conventional IR methods, as well as pre-trained and untrained models with similar network structures under multiple conditions. These improvements are particularly significant in the few-view, limited-angle, and low-dose imaging configurations.   Conclusions: Applying to both parallel and fan beam X-ray imaging, our framework shows significant improvement under multiple conditions. Furthermore, the proposed framework requires no training data and can be adjusted on-demand to adapt to different conditions (e.g. noise level, geometry, and imaged object)."
2210.14485,Reconstruction from edge image combined with color and gradient   difference for industrial surface anomaly detection,"Reconstruction-based methods are widely explored in industrial visual anomaly detection. Such methods commonly require the model to well reconstruct the normal patterns but fail in the anomalies, and thus the anomalies can be detected by evaluating the reconstruction errors. However, in practice, it's usually difficult to control the generalization boundary of the model. The model with an overly strong generalization capability can even well reconstruct the abnormal regions, making them less distinguishable, while the model with a poor generalization capability can not reconstruct those changeable high-frequency components in the normal regions, which ultimately leads to false positives. To tackle the above issue, we propose a new reconstruction network where we reconstruct the original RGB image from its gray value edges (EdgRec). Specifically, this is achieved by an UNet-type denoising autoencoder with skip connections. The input edge and skip connections can well preserve the high-frequency information in the original image. Meanwhile, the proposed restoration task can force the network to memorize the normal low-frequency and color information. Besides, the denoising design can prevent the model from directly copying the original high-frequent components. To evaluate the anomalies, we further propose a new interpretable hand-crafted evaluation function that considers both the color and gradient differences. Our method achieves competitive results on the challenging benchmark MVTec AD (97.8\% for detection and 97.7\% for localization, AUROC). In addition, we conduct experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and show convincing results using RGB images only. Our code will be available at https://github.com/liutongkun/EdgRec."
2210.14562,FairCLIP: Social Bias Elimination based on Attribute Prototype Learning   and Representation Neutralization,"The Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models like CLIP have gained popularity in recent years. However, many works found that the social biases hidden in CLIP easily manifest in downstream tasks, especially in image retrieval, which can have harmful effects on human society. In this work, we propose FairCLIP to eliminate the social bias in CLIP-based image retrieval without damaging the retrieval performance achieving the compatibility between the debiasing effect and the retrieval performance. FairCLIP is divided into two steps: Attribute Prototype Learning (APL) and Representation Neutralization (RN). In the first step, we extract the concepts needed for debiasing in CLIP. We use the query with learnable word vector prefixes as the extraction structure. In the second step, we first divide the attributes into target and bias attributes. By analysis, we find that both attributes have an impact on the bias. Therefore, we try to eliminate the bias by using Re-Representation Matrix (RRM) to achieve the neutralization of the representation. We compare the debiasing effect and retrieval performance with other methods, and experiments demonstrate that FairCLIP can achieve the best compatibility. Although FairCLIP is used to eliminate bias in image retrieval, it achieves the neutralization of the representation which is common to all CLIP downstream tasks. This means that FairCLIP can be applied as a general debiasing method for other fairness issues related to CLIP."
2210.14571,Towards the Detection of Diffusion Model Deepfakes,"In the course of the past few years, diffusion models (DMs) have reached an unprecedented level of visual quality. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the detection of DM-generated images, which is critical to prevent adverse impacts on our society. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been extensively studied from a forensic perspective. In this work, we therefore take the natural next step to evaluate whether previous methods can be used to detect images generated by DMs. Our experiments yield two key findings: (1) state-of-the-art GAN detectors are unable to reliably distinguish real from DM-generated images, but (2) re-training them on DM-generated images allows for almost perfect detection, which remarkably even generalizes to GANs. Together with a feature space analysis, our results lead to the hypothesis that DMs produce fewer detectable artifacts and are thus more difficult to detect compared to GANs. One possible reason for this is the absence of grid-like frequency artifacts in DM-generated images, which are a known weakness of GANs. However, we make the interesting observation that diffusion models tend to underestimate high frequencies, which we attribute to the learning objective."
2210.15033,Multi-Scale Structural-aware Exposure Correction for Endoscopic Imaging,"Endoscopy is the most widely used imaging technique for the diagnosis of cancerous lesions in hollow organs. However, endoscopic images are often affected by illumination artefacts: image parts may be over- or underexposed according to the light source pose and the tissue orientation. These artifacts have a strong negative impact on the performance of computer vision or AI-based diagnosis tools. Although endoscopic image enhancement methods are greatly required, little effort has been devoted to over- and under-exposition enhancement in real-time. This contribution presents an extension to the objective function of LMSPEC, a method originally introduced to enhance images from natural scenes. It is used here for the exposure correction in endoscopic imaging and the preservation of structural information. To the best of our knowledge, this contribution is the first one that addresses the enhancement of endoscopic images using deep learning (DL) methods. Tested on the Endo4IE dataset, the proposed implementation has yielded a significant improvement over LMSPEC reaching a SSIM increase of 4.40% and 4.21% for over- and underexposed images, respectively."
2210.15182,Text2Model: Text-based Model Induction for Zero-shot Image   Classification,"We address the challenge of building task-agnostic classifiers using only text descriptions, demonstrating a unified approach to image classification, 3D point cloud classification, and action recognition from scenes. Unlike approaches that learn a fixed representation of the output classes, we generate at inference time a model tailored to a query classification task. To generate task-based zero-shot classifiers, we train a hypernetwork that receives class descriptions and outputs a multi-class model. The hypernetwork is designed to be equivariant with respect to the set of descriptions and the classification layer, thus obeying the symmetries of the problem and improving generalization. Our approach generates non-linear classifiers, handles rich textual descriptions, and may be adapted to produce lightweight models efficient enough for on-device applications. We evaluate this approach in a series of zero-shot classification tasks, for image, point-cloud, and action recognition, using a range of text descriptions: From single words to rich descriptions. Our results demonstrate strong improvements over previous approaches, showing that zero-shot learning can be applied with little training data. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis with foundational vision and language models, demonstrating that they struggle to generalize when describing what attributes the class lacks."
2210.15194,Few-shot Image Generation via Masked Discrimination,"Few-shot image generation aims to generate images of high quality and great diversity with limited data. However, it is difficult for modern GANs to avoid overfitting when trained on only a few images. The discriminator can easily remember all the training samples and guide the generator to replicate them, leading to severe diversity degradation. Several methods have been proposed to relieve overfitting by adapting GANs pre-trained on large source domains to target domains using limited real samples. This work presents a novel approach to realize few-shot GAN adaptation via masked discrimination. Random masks are applied to features extracted by the discriminator from input images. We aim to encourage the discriminator to judge various images which share partially common features with training samples as realistic. Correspondingly, the generator is guided to generate diverse images instead of replicating training samples. In addition, we employ a cross-domain consistency loss for the discriminator to keep relative distances between generated samples in its feature space. It strengthens global image discrimination and guides adapted GANs to preserve more information learned from source domains for higher image quality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively with higher quality and greater diversity on a series of few-shot image generation tasks than prior methods."
2210.15457,One-Class Risk Estimation for One-Class Hyperspectral Image   Classification,"Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) one-class classification is aimed at identifying a single target class from the HSI by using only knowing positive data, which can significantly reduce the requirements for annotation. However, when one-class classification meets HSI, it is difficult for classifiers to find a balance between the overfitting and underfitting of positive data due to the problems of distribution overlap and distribution imbalance. Although deep learning-based methods are currently the mainstream to overcome distribution overlap in HSI multiclassification, few studies focus on deep learning-based HSI one-class classification. In this article, a weakly supervised deep HSI one-class classifier, namely, HOneCls, is proposed, where a risk estimator,the one-class risk estimator, is particularly introduced to make the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with the ability of one class classification in the case of distribution imbalance. Extensive experiments (20 tasks in total) were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed classifier."
2210.15563,Multimodal Transformer Distillation for Audio-Visual Synchronization,"Audio-visual synchronization aims to determine whether the mouth movements and speech in the video are synchronized. VocaLiST reaches state-of-the-art performance by incorporating multimodal Transformers to model audio-visual interact information. However, it requires high computing resources, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper proposed an MTDVocaLiST model, which is trained by our proposed multimodal Transformer distillation (MTD) loss. MTD loss enables MTDVocaLiST model to deeply mimic the cross-attention distribution and value-relation in the Transformer of VocaLiST. Additionally, we harness uncertainty weighting to fully exploit the interaction information across all layers. Our proposed method is effective in two aspects: From the distillation method perspective, MTD loss outperforms other strong distillation baselines. From the distilled model's performance perspective: 1) MTDVocaLiST outperforms similar-size SOTA models, SyncNet, and Perfect Match models by 15.65% and 3.35%; 2) MTDVocaLiST reduces the model size of VocaLiST by 83.52%, yet still maintaining similar performance."
2210.15701,Do Pre-trained Models Benefit Equally in Continual Learning?,"Existing work on continual learning (CL) is primarily devoted to developing algorithms for models trained from scratch. Despite their encouraging performance on contrived benchmarks, these algorithms show dramatic performance drops in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper advocates the systematic introduction of pre-training to CL, which is a general recipe for transferring knowledge to downstream tasks but is substantially missing in the CL community. Our investigation reveals the multifaceted complexity of exploiting pre-trained models for CL, along three different axes, pre-trained models, CL algorithms, and CL scenarios. Perhaps most intriguingly, improvements in CL algorithms from pre-training are very inconsistent an underperforming algorithm could become competitive and even state-of-the-art when all algorithms start from a pre-trained model. This indicates that the current paradigm, where all CL methods are compared in from-scratch training, is not well reflective of the true CL objective and desired progress. In addition, we make several other important observations, including that CL algorithms that exert less regularization benefit more from a pre-trained model; and that a stronger pre-trained model such as CLIP does not guarantee a better improvement. Based on these findings, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline that employs minimum regularization and leverages the more beneficial pre-trained model, coupled with a two-stage training pipeline. We recommend including this strong baseline in the future development of CL algorithms, due to its demonstrated state-of-the-art performance."
2210.15889,Towards Data-and Knowledge-Driven Artificial Intelligence: A Survey on   Neuro-Symbolic Computing,"Neural-symbolic computing (NeSy), which pursues the integration of the symbolic and statistical paradigms of cognition, has been an active research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for many years. As NeSy shows promise of reconciling the advantages of reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation and robust learning in neural networks, it may serve as a catalyst for the next generation of AI. In the present paper, we provide a systematic overview of the recent developments and important contributions of NeSy research. Firstly, we introduce study history of this area, covering early work and foundations. We further discuss background concepts and identify key driving factors behind the development of NeSy. Afterward, we categorize recent landmark approaches along several main characteristics that underline this research paradigm, including neural-symbolic integration, knowledge representation, knowledge embedding, and functionality. Next, we briefly discuss the successful application of modern NeSy approaches in several domains. Then, we benchmark several NeSy methods on three representative application tasks. Finally, we identify the open problems together with potential future research directions. This survey is expected to help new researchers enter this rapidly evolving field and accelerate the progress towards data-and knowledge-driven AI."
2210.15996,Towards Generalized Few-Shot Open-Set Object Detection,"Open-set object detection (OSOD) aims to detect the known categories and reject unknown objects in a dynamic world, which has achieved significant attention. However, previous approaches only consider this problem in data-abundant conditions, while neglecting the few-shot scenes. In this paper, we seek a solution for the generalized few-shot open-set object detection (G-FOOD), which aims to avoid detecting unknown classes as known classes with a high confidence score while maintaining the performance of few-shot detection. The main challenge for this task is that few training samples induce the model to overfit on the known classes, resulting in a poor open-set performance. We propose a new G-FOOD algorithm to tackle this issue, named \underline{F}ew-sh\underline{O}t \underline{O}pen-set \underline{D}etector (FOOD), which contains a novel class weight sparsification classifier (CWSC) and a novel unknown decoupling learner (UDL). To prevent over-fitting, CWSC randomly sparses parts of the normalized weights for the logit prediction of all classes, and then decreases the co-adaptability between the class and its neighbors. Alongside, UDL decouples training the unknown class and enables the model to form a compact unknown decision boundary. Thus, the unknown objects can be identified with a confidence probability without any threshold, prototype, or generation. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art OSOD methods in few-shot scenes and observe that our method improves the F-score of unknown classes by 4.80\%-9.08\% across all shots in VOC-COCO dataset settings \footnote[1]{The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/binyisu/food}}."
2210.16083,ROMA: Run-Time Object Detection To Maximize Real-Time Accuracy,"This paper analyzes the effects of dynamically varying video contents and detection latency on the real-time detection accuracy of a detector and proposes a new run-time accuracy variation model, ROMA, based on the findings from the analysis. ROMA is designed to select an optimal detector out of a set of detectors in real time without label information to maximize real-time object detection accuracy. ROMA utilizing four YOLOv4 detectors on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano shows real-time accuracy improvements by 4 to 37% for a scenario of dynamically varying video contents and detection latency consisting of MOT17Det and MOT20Det datasets, compared to individual YOLOv4 detectors and two state-of-the-art runtime techniques."
2210.16101,A Generic Shared Attention Mechanism for Various Backbone Neural   Networks,"The self-attention mechanism has emerged as a critical component for improving the performance of various backbone neural networks. However, current mainstream approaches individually incorporate newly designed self-attention modules (SAMs) into each layer of the network for granted without fully exploiting their parameters' potential. This leads to suboptimal performance and increased parameter consumption as the network depth increases. To improve this paradigm, in this paper, we first present a counterintuitive but inherent phenomenon: SAMs tend to produce strongly correlated attention maps across different layers, with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of up to 0.85. Inspired by this inherent observation, we propose Dense-and-Implicit Attention (DIA), which directly shares SAMs across layers and employs a long short-term memory module to calibrate and bridge the highly correlated attention maps of different layers, thus improving the parameter utilization efficiency of SAMs. This design of DIA is also consistent with the neural network's dynamical system perspective. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our simple yet effective DIA can consistently enhance various network backbones, including ResNet, Transformer, and UNet, across tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image generation using diffusion models."
2210.16107,SeaDroneSim: Simulation of Aerial Images for Detection of Objects Above   Water,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are known for their fast and versatile applicability. With UAVs' growth in availability and applications, they are now of vital importance in serving as technological support in search-and-rescue(SAR) operations in marine environments. High-resolution cameras and GPUs can be equipped on the UAVs to provide effective and efficient aid to emergency rescue operations. With modern computer vision algorithms, we can detect objects for aiming such rescue missions. However, these modern computer vision algorithms are dependent on numerous amounts of training data from UAVs, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive for maritime environments. To this end, we present a new benchmark suite, SeaDroneSim, that can be used to create photo-realistic aerial image datasets with the ground truth for segmentation masks of any given object. Utilizing only the synthetic data generated from SeaDroneSim, we obtain 71 mAP on real aerial images for detecting BlueROV as a feasibility study. This result from the new simulation suit also serves as a baseline for the detection of BlueROV."
2210.16140,Localized Randomized Smoothing for Collective Robustness Certification,"Models for image segmentation, node classification and many other tasks map a single input to multiple labels. By perturbing this single shared input (e.g. the image) an adversary can manipulate several predictions (e.g. misclassify several pixels). Collective robustness certification is the task of provably bounding the number of robust predictions under this threat model. The only dedicated method that goes beyond certifying each output independently is limited to strictly local models, where each prediction is associated with a small receptive field. We propose a more general collective robustness certificate for all types of models. We further show that this approach is beneficial for the larger class of softly local models, where each output is dependent on the entire input but assigns different levels of importance to different input regions (e.g. based on their proximity in the image). The certificate is based on our novel localized randomized smoothing approach, where the random perturbation strength for different input regions is proportional to their importance for the outputs. Localized smoothing Pareto-dominates existing certificates on both image segmentation and node classification tasks, simultaneously offering higher accuracy and stronger certificates."
2210.16380,Incorporating Crowdsourced Annotator Distributions into Ensemble   Modeling to Improve Classification Trustworthiness for Ancient Greek Papyri,"Performing classification on noisy, crowdsourced image datasets can prove challenging even for the best neural networks. Two issues which complicate the problem on such datasets are class imbalance and ground-truth uncertainty in labeling. The AL-ALL and AL-PUB datasets - consisting of tightly cropped, individual characters from images of ancient Greek papyri - are strongly affected by both issues. The application of ensemble modeling to such datasets can help identify images where the ground-truth is questionable and quantify the trustworthiness of those samples. As such, we apply stacked generalization consisting of nearly identical ResNets with different loss functions: one utilizing sparse cross-entropy (CXE) and the other Kullback-Liebler Divergence (KLD). Both networks use labels drawn from a crowd-sourced consensus. This consensus is derived from a Normalized Distribution of Annotations (NDA) based on all annotations for a given character in the dataset. For the second network, the KLD is calculated with respect to the NDA. For our ensemble model, we apply a k-nearest neighbors model to the outputs of the CXE and KLD networks. Individually, the ResNet models have approximately 93% accuracy, while the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of > 95%, increasing the classification trustworthiness. We also perform an analysis of the Shannon entropy of the various models' output distributions to measure classification uncertainty. Our results suggest that entropy is useful for predicting model misclassifications."
2210.16467,ImplantFormer: Vision Transformer based Implant Position Regression   Using Dental CBCT Data,"Implant prosthesis is the most appropriate treatment for dentition defect or dentition loss, which usually involves a surgical guide design process to decide the implant position. However, such design heavily relies on the subjective experiences of dentists. In this paper, a transformer-based Implant Position Regression Network, ImplantFormer, is proposed to automatically predict the implant position based on the oral CBCT data. We creatively propose to predict the implant position using the 2D axial view of the tooth crown area and fit a centerline of the implant to obtain the actual implant position at the tooth root. Convolutional stem and decoder are designed to coarsely extract image features before the operation of patch embedding and integrate multi-level feature maps for robust prediction, respectively. As both long-range relationship and local features are involved, our approach can better represent global information and achieves better location performance. Extensive experiments on a dental implant dataset through five-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the proposed ImplantFormer achieves superior performance than existing methods."
2210.16584,Interpretable CNN-Multilevel Attention Transformer for Rapid Recognition   of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images,"Chest imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing and predicting patients with COVID-19 with evidence of worsening respiratory status. Many deep learning-based approaches for pneumonia recognition have been developed to enable computer-aided diagnosis. However, the long training and inference time makes them inflexible, and the lack of interpretability reduces their credibility in clinical medical practice. This paper aims to develop a pneumonia recognition framework with interpretability, which can understand the complex relationship between lung features and related diseases in chest X-ray (CXR) images to provide high-speed analytics support for medical practice. To reduce the computational complexity to accelerate the recognition process, a novel multi-level self-attention mechanism within Transformer has been proposed to accelerate convergence and emphasize the task-related feature regions. Moreover, a practical CXR image data augmentation has been adopted to address the scarcity of medical image data problems to boost the model's performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated on the classic COVID-19 recognition task using the widespread pneumonia CXR image dataset. In addition, abundant ablation experiments validate the effectiveness and necessity of all of the components of the proposed method."
2210.16900,High Resolution Multi-Scale RAFT (Robust Vision Challenge 2022),"In this report, we present our optical flow approach, MS-RAFT+, that won the Robust Vision Challenge 2022. It is based on the MS-RAFT method, which successfully integrates several multi-scale concepts into single-scale RAFT. Our approach extends this method by exploiting an additional finer scale for estimating the flow, which is made feasible by on-demand cost computation. This way, it can not only operate at half the original resolution, but also use MS-RAFT's shared convex upsampler to obtain full resolution flow. Moreover, our approach relies on an adjusted fine-tuning scheme during training. This in turn aims at improving the generalization across benchmarks. Among all participating methods in the Robust Vision Challenge, our approach ranks first on VIPER and second on KITTI, Sintel, and Middlebury, resulting in the first place of the overall ranking."
2210.17180,Automated Dominative Subspace Mining for Efficient Neural Architecture   Search,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automatically find effective architectures within a predefined search space. However, the search space is often extremely large. As a result, directly searching in such a large search space is non-trivial and also very time-consuming. To address the above issues, in each search step, we seek to limit the search space to a small but effective subspace to boost both the search performance and search efficiency. To this end, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search method via Dominative Subspace Mining (DSM-NAS) that finds promising architectures in automatically mined subspaces. Specifically, we first perform a global search, i.e ., dominative subspace mining, to find a good subspace from a set of candidates. Then, we perform a local search within the mined subspace to find effective architectures. More critically, we further boost search performance by taking well-designed/ searched architectures to initialize candidate subspaces. Experimental results demonstrate that DSM-NAS not only reduces the search cost but also discovers better architectures than state-of-the-art methods in various benchmark search spaces."
2211.00218,Pixel-Wise Contrastive Distillation,"We present a simple but effective pixel-level self-supervised distillation framework friendly to dense prediction tasks. Our method, called Pixel-Wise Contrastive Distillation (PCD), distills knowledge by attracting the corresponding pixels from student's and teacher's output feature maps. PCD includes a novel design called SpatialAdaptor which ``reshapes'' a part of the teacher network while preserving the distribution of its output features. Our ablation experiments suggest that this reshaping behavior enables more informative pixel-to-pixel distillation. Moreover, we utilize a plug-in multi-head self-attention module that explicitly relates the pixels of student's feature maps to enhance the effective receptive field, leading to a more competitive student. PCD \textbf{outperforms} previous self-supervised distillation methods on various dense prediction tasks. A backbone of \mbox{ResNet-18-FPN} distilled by PCD achieves $37.4$ AP$^\text{bbox}$ and $34.0$ AP$^\text{mask}$ on COCO dataset using the detector of \mbox{Mask R-CNN}. We hope our study will inspire future research on how to pre-train a small model friendly to dense prediction tasks in a self-supervised fashion."
2211.00313,RGMIM: Region-Guided Masked Image Modeling for Learning Meaningful   Representations from X-Ray Images,"In this study, we propose a novel method called region-guided masked image modeling (RGMIM) for learning meaningful representations from X-ray images. Our method adopts a new masking strategy that utilizes organ mask information to identify valid regions for learning more meaningful representations. We conduct quantitative evaluations on an open lung X-ray image dataset as well as masking ratio hyperparameter studies. When using the entire training set, RGMIM outperformed other comparable methods, achieving a 0.962 lung disease detection accuracy. Specifically, RGMIM significantly improved performance in small data volumes, such as 5% and 10% of the training set compared to other methods. RGMIM can mask more valid regions, facilitating the learning of discriminative representations and the subsequent high-accuracy lung disease detection. RGMIM outperforms other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in experiments, particularly when limited training data is used."
2211.00577,Fine-tuned Generative Adversarial Network-based Model for Medical Image   Super-Resolution,"In the field of medical image analysis, there is a substantial need for high-resolution (HR) images to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, it is a challenging task to obtain HR medical images, as it requires advanced instruments and significant time. Deep learning-based super-resolution methods can help to improve the resolution and perceptual quality of low-resolution (LR) medical images. Recently, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based methods have shown remarkable performance among deep learning-based super-resolution methods. Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is a practical model for recovering HR images from real-world LR images. In our proposed approach, we use transfer learning technique and fine-tune the pre-trained Real-ESRGAN model using medical image datasets. This technique helps in improving the performance of the model. We employ the high-order degradation model of the Real-ESRGAN which better simulates real-world image degradations. This adaptation allows for generating more realistic degraded medical images, resulting in improved performance. The focus of this paper is on enhancing the resolution and perceptual quality of chest X-ray and retinal images. We use the Tuberculosis chest X-ray (Shenzhen) dataset and the STARE dataset of retinal images for fine-tuning the model. The proposed model achieves superior perceptual quality compared to the Real-ESRGAN model, effectively preserving fine details and generating images with more realistic textures."
2211.00646,Learning Melanocytic Cell Masks from Adjacent Stained Tissue,"Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, causing a large proportion of skin cancer deaths. However, melanoma diagnoses by pathologists shows low interrater reliability. As melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte, there is a clear need to develop a melanocytic cell segmentation tool that is agnostic to pathologist variability and automates pixel-level annotation. Gigapixel-level pathologist labeling, however, is impractical. Herein, we propose a means to train deep neural networks for melanocytic cell segmentation from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections and paired immunohistochemistry (IHC) of adjacent tissue sections, achieving a mean IOU of 0.64 despite imperfect ground-truth labels."
2211.00868,tSF: Transformer-based Semantic Filter for Few-Shot Learning,"Few-Shot Learning (FSL) alleviates the data shortage challenge via embedding discriminative target-aware features among plenty seen (base) and few unseen (novel) labeled samples. Most feature embedding modules in recent FSL methods are specially designed for corresponding learning tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, and object detection), which limits the utility of embedding features. To this end, we propose a light and universal module named transformer-based Semantic Filter (tSF), which can be applied for different FSL tasks. The proposed tSF redesigns the inputs of a transformer-based structure by a semantic filter, which not only embeds the knowledge from whole base set to novel set but also filters semantic features for target category. Furthermore, the parameters of tSF is equal to half of a standard transformer block (less than 1M). In the experiments, our tSF is able to boost the performances in different classic few-shot learning tasks (about 2% improvement), especially outperforms the state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmark datasets in few-shot classification task."
2211.01095,DPM-Solver++: Fast Solver for Guided Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models,"Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in high-resolution image synthesis, especially in recent large-scale text-to-image generation applications. An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs."
2211.01096,Recovering Sign Bits of DCT Coefficients in Digital Images as an   Optimization Problem,"Recovering unknown, missing, damaged, distorted, or lost information in DCT coefficients is a common task in multiple applications of digital image processing, including image compression, selective image encryption, and image communication. This paper investigates the recovery of sign bits in DCT coefficients of digital images, by proposing two different approximation methods to solve a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is NP-hard in general. One method is a relaxation of the MILP problem to a linear programming (LP) problem, and the other splits the original MILP problem into some smaller MILP problems and an LP problem. We considered how the proposed methods can be applied to JPEG-encoded images and conducted extensive experiments to validate their performances. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods outperformed other existing methods by a substantial margin, both according to objective quality metrics and our subjective evaluation."
2211.01111,On the Benefit of Dual-domain Denoising in a Self-supervised Low-dose CT   Setting,"Computed tomography (CT) is routinely used for three-dimensional non-invasive imaging. Numerous data-driven image denoising algorithms were proposed to restore image quality in low-dose acquisitions. However, considerably less research investigates methods already intervening in the raw detector data due to limited access to suitable projection data or correct reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we present an end-to-end trainable CT reconstruction pipeline that contains denoising operators in both the projection and the image domain and that are optimized simultaneously without requiring ground-truth high-dose CT data. Our experiments demonstrate that including an additional projection denoising operator improved the overall denoising performance by 82.4-94.1%/12.5-41.7% (PSNR/SSIM) on abdomen CT and 1.5-2.9%/0.4-0.5% (PSNR/SSIM) on XRM data relative to the low-dose baseline. We make our entire helical CT reconstruction framework publicly available that contains a raw projection rebinning step to render helical projection data suitable for differentiable fan-beam reconstruction operators and end-to-end learning."
2211.01174,Hypergraph Convolutional Network based Weakly Supervised Point Cloud   Semantic Segmentation with Scene-Level Annotations,"Point cloud segmentation with scene-level annotations is a promising but challenging task. Currently, the most popular way is to employ the class activation map (CAM) to locate discriminative regions and then generate point-level pseudo labels from scene-level annotations. However, these methods always suffer from the point imbalance among categories, as well as the sparse and incomplete supervision from CAM. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted hypergraph convolutional network-based method, called WHCN, to confront the challenges of learning point-wise labels from scene-level annotations. Firstly, in order to simultaneously overcome the point imbalance among different categories and reduce the model complexity, superpoints of a training point cloud are generated by exploiting the geometrically homogeneous partition. Then, a hypergraph is constructed based on the high-confidence superpoint-level seeds which are converted from scene-level annotations. Secondly, the WHCN takes the hypergraph as input and learns to predict high-precision point-level pseudo labels by label propagation. Besides the backbone network consisting of spectral hypergraph convolution blocks, a hyperedge attention module is learned to adjust the weights of hyperedges in the WHCN. Finally, a segmentation network is trained by these pseudo point cloud labels. We comprehensively conduct experiments on the ScanNet and S3DIS segmentation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WHCN is effective to predict the point labels with scene annotations, and yields state-of-the-art results in the community. The source code is available at http://zhiyongsu.github.io/Project/WHCN.html."
2211.01201,Human alignment of neural network representations,"Today's computer vision models achieve human or near-human level performance across a wide variety of vision tasks. However, their architectures, data, and learning algorithms differ in numerous ways from those that give rise to human vision. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the alignment between the representations learned by neural networks and human mental representations inferred from behavioral responses. We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not. Overall, although models trained on larger, more diverse datasets achieve better alignment with humans than models trained on ImageNet alone, our results indicate that scaling alone is unlikely to be sufficient to train neural networks with conceptual representations that match those used by humans."
2211.01207,Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection Dataset,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread so quickly around the world that many countries had to set mandatory face mask rules in public areas to reduce the transmission of the virus. To monitor public adherence, researchers aimed to rapidly develop efficient systems that can detect faces with masks automatically. However, the lack of representative and novel datasets proved to be the biggest challenge. Early attempts to collect face mask datasets did not account for potential race, gender, and age biases. Therefore, the resulting models show inherent biases toward specific race groups, such as Asian or Caucasian. In this work, we present a novel face mask detection dataset that contains images posted on Twitter during the pandemic from around the world. Unlike previous datasets, the proposed Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection (BAFMD) dataset contains more images from underrepresented race and age groups to mitigate the problem for the face mask detection task. We perform experiments to investigate potential biases in widely used face mask detection datasets and illustrate that the BAFMD dataset yields models with better performance and generalization ability. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/Alpkant/BAFMD."
2211.01323,Generation of Anonymous Chest Radiographs Using Latent Diffusion Models   for Training Thoracic Abnormality Classification Systems,"The availability of large-scale chest X-ray datasets is a requirement for developing well-performing deep learning-based algorithms in thoracic abnormality detection and classification. However, biometric identifiers in chest radiographs hinder the public sharing of such data for research purposes due to the risk of patient re-identification. To counteract this issue, synthetic data generation offers a solution for anonymizing medical images. This work employs a latent diffusion model to synthesize an anonymous chest X-ray dataset of high-quality class-conditional images. We propose a privacy-enhancing sampling strategy to ensure the non-transference of biometric information during the image generation process. The quality of the generated images and the feasibility of serving as exclusive training data are evaluated on a thoracic abnormality classification task. Compared to a real classifier, we achieve competitive results with a performance gap of only 3.5% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve."
2211.01412,CAMANet: Class Activation Map Guided Attention Network for Radiology   Report Generation,"Radiology report generation (RRG) has gained increasing research attention because of its huge potential to mitigate medical resource shortages and aid the process of disease decision making by radiologists. Recent advancements in RRG are largely driven by improving a model's capabilities in encoding single-modal feature representations, while few studies explicitly explore the cross-modal alignment between image regions and words. Radiologists typically focus first on abnormal image regions before composing the corresponding text descriptions, thus cross-modal alignment is of great importance to learn a RRG model which is aware of abnormalities in the image. Motivated by this, we propose a Class Activation Map guided Attention Network (CAMANet) which explicitly promotes crossmodal alignment by employing aggregated class activation maps to supervise cross-modal attention learning, and simultaneously enrich the discriminative information. CAMANet contains three complementary modules: a Visual Discriminative Map Generation module to generate the importance/contribution of each visual token; Visual Discriminative Map Assisted Encoder to learn the discriminative representation and enrich the discriminative information; and a Visual Textual Attention Consistency module to ensure the attention consistency between the visual and textual tokens, to achieve the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMANet outperforms previous SOTA methods on two commonly used RRG benchmarks."
2211.01579,Data-free Defense of Black Box Models Against Adversarial Attacks,"Several companies often safeguard their trained deep models (i.e., details of architecture, learnt weights, training details etc.) from third-party users by exposing them only as black boxes through APIs. Moreover, they may not even provide access to the training data due to proprietary reasons or sensitivity concerns. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism for black box models against adversarial attacks in a data-free set up. We construct synthetic data via generative model and train surrogate network using model stealing techniques. To minimize adversarial contamination on perturbed samples, we propose 'wavelet noise remover' (WNR) that performs discrete wavelet decomposition on input images and carefully select only a few important coefficients determined by our 'wavelet coefficient selection module' (WCSM). To recover the high-frequency content of the image after noise removal via WNR, we further train a 'regenerator' network with an objective to retrieve the coefficients such that the reconstructed image yields similar to original predictions on the surrogate model. At test time, WNR combined with trained regenerator network is prepended to the black box network, resulting in a high boost in adversarial accuracy. Our method improves the adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 38.98% and 32.01% on state-of-the-art Auto Attack compared to baseline, even when the attacker uses surrogate architecture (Alexnet-half and Alexnet) similar to the black box architecture (Alexnet) with same model stealing strategy as defender. The code is available at https://github.com/vcl-iisc/data-free-black-box-defense"
2211.01779,Exploring explicit coarse-grained structure in artificial neural   networks,"We propose to employ the hierarchical coarse-grained structure in the artificial neural networks explicitly to improve the interpretability without degrading performance. The idea has been applied in two situations. One is a neural network called TaylorNet, which aims to approximate the general mapping from input data to output result in terms of Taylor series directly, without resorting to any magic nonlinear activations. The other is a new setup for data distillation, which can perform multi-level abstraction of the input dataset and generate new data that possesses the relevant features of the original dataset and can be used as references for classification. In both cases, the coarse-grained structure plays an important role in simplifying the network and improving both the interpretability and efficiency. The validity has been demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Further improvement and some open questions related are also discussed."
2211.01783,Quantifying and Learning Static vs. Dynamic Information in Deep   Spatiotemporal Networks,"There is limited understanding of the information captured by deep spatiotemporal models in their intermediate representations. For example, while evidence suggests that action recognition algorithms are heavily influenced by visual appearance in single frames, no quantitative methodology exists for evaluating such static bias in the latent representation compared to bias toward dynamics. We tackle this challenge by proposing an approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal model, and apply our approach to three tasks, action recognition, automatic video object segmentation (AVOS) and video instance segmentation (VIS). Our key findings are: (i) Most examined models are biased toward static information. (ii) Some datasets that are assumed to be biased toward dynamics are actually biased toward static information. (iii) Individual channels in an architecture can be biased toward static, dynamic or a combination of the two. (iv) Most models converge to their culminating biases in the first half of training. We then explore how these biases affect performance on dynamically biased datasets. For action recognition, we propose StaticDropout, a semantically guided dropout that debiases a model from static information toward dynamics. For AVOS, we design a better combination of fusion and cross connection layers compared with previous architectures."
2211.02400,Fighting the scanner effect in brain MRI segmentation with a progressive   level-of-detail network trained on multi-site data,"Many clinical and research studies of the human brain require an accurate structural MRI segmentation. While traditional atlas-based methods can be applied to volumes from any acquisition site, recent deep learning algorithms ensure very high accuracy only when tested on data from the same sites exploited in training (i.e., internal data). The performance degradation experienced on external data (i.e., unseen volumes from unseen sites) is due to the inter-site variabilities in intensity distributions induced by different MR scanner models, acquisition parameters, and unique artefacts. To mitigate this site-dependency, often referred to as the scanner effect, we propose LOD-Brain, a 3D convolutional neural network with progressive levels-of-detail (LOD) able to segment brain data from any site. Coarser network levels are responsible to learn a robust anatomical prior useful for identifying brain structures and their locations, while finer levels refine the model to handle site-specific intensity distributions and anatomical variations. We ensure robustness across sites by training the model on an unprecedented rich dataset aggregating data from open repositories: almost 27,000 T1w volumes from around 160 acquisition sites, at 1.5 - 3T, from a population spanning from 8 to 90 years old. Extensive tests demonstrate that LOD-Brain produces state-of-the-art results, with no significant difference in performance between internal and external sites, and robust to challenging anatomical variations. Its portability opens the way for large scale application across different healthcare institutions, patient populations, and imaging technology manufacturers. Code, model, and demo are available at the project website."
2211.02695,WaveNets: Wavelet Channel Attention Networks,"Channel Attention reigns supreme as an effective technique in the field of computer vision. However, the proposed channel attention by SENet suffers from information loss in feature learning caused by the use of Global Average Pooling (GAP) to represent channels as scalars. Thus, designing effective channel attention mechanisms requires finding a solution to enhance features preservation in modeling channel inter-dependencies. In this work, we utilize Wavelet transform compression as a solution to the channel representation problem. We first test wavelet transform as an Auto-Encoder model equipped with conventional channel attention module. Next, we test wavelet transform as a standalone channel compression method. We prove that global average pooling is equivalent to the recursive approximate Haar wavelet transform. With this proof, we generalize channel attention using Wavelet compression and name it WaveNet. Implementation of our method can be embedded within existing channel attention methods with a couple of lines of code. We test our proposed method using ImageNet dataset for image classification task. Our method outperforms the baseline SENet, and achieves the state-of-the-art results. Our code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hady1011/WaveNet-C."
2211.02736,Discovering Closed-Loop Failures of Vision-Based Controllers via   Reachability Analysis,"Machine learning driven image-based controllers allow robotic systems to take intelligent actions based on the visual feedback from their environment. Understanding when these controllers might lead to system safety violations is important for their integration in safety-critical applications and engineering corrective safety measures for the system. Existing methods leverage simulation-based testing (or falsification) to find the failures of vision-based controllers, i.e., the visual inputs that lead to closed-loop safety violations. However, these techniques do not scale well to the scenarios involving high-dimensional and complex visual inputs, such as RGB images. In this work, we cast the problem of finding closed-loop vision failures as a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability problem. Our approach blends simulation-based analysis with HJ reachability methods to compute an approximation of the backward reachable tube (BRT) of the system, i.e., the set of unsafe states for the system under vision-based controllers. Utilizing the BRT, we can tractably and systematically find the system states and corresponding visual inputs that lead to closed-loop failures. These visual inputs can be subsequently analyzed to find the input characteristics that might have caused the failure. Besides its scalability to high-dimensional visual inputs, an explicit computation of BRT allows the proposed approach to capture non-trivial system failures that are difficult to expose via random simulations. We demonstrate our framework on two case studies involving an RGB image-based neural network controller for (a) autonomous indoor navigation, and (b) autonomous aircraft taxiing."
2211.02915,ESKNet-An enhanced adaptive selection kernel convolution for breast   tumors segmentation,"Breast cancer is one of the common cancers that endanger the health of women globally. Accurate target lesion segmentation is essential for early clinical intervention and postoperative follow-up. Recently, many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to segment breast tumors from ultrasound images. However, the complex ultrasound pattern and the variable tumor shape and size bring challenges to the accurate segmentation of the breast lesion. Motivated by the selective kernel convolution, we introduce an enhanced selective kernel convolution for breast tumor segmentation, which integrates multiple feature map region representations and adaptively recalibrates the weights of these feature map regions from the channel and spatial dimensions. This region recalibration strategy enables the network to focus more on high-contributing region features and mitigate the perturbation of less useful regions. Finally, the enhanced selective kernel convolution is integrated into U-net with deep supervision constraints to adaptively capture the robust representation of breast tumors. Extensive experiments with twelve state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods on three public breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that our method has a more competitive segmentation performance in breast ultrasound images."
2211.02967,Improved Kidney Stone Recognition Through Attention and Multi-View   Feature Fusion Strategies,"This contribution presents a deep learning method for the extraction and fusion of information relating to kidney stone fragments acquired from different viewpoints of the endoscope. Surface and section fragment images are jointly used during the training of the classifier to improve the discrimination power of the features by adding attention layers at the end of each convolutional block. This approach is specifically designed to mimic the morpho-constitutional analysis performed in ex-vivo by biologists to visually identify kidney stones by inspecting both views. The addition of attention mechanisms to the backbone improved the results of single view extraction backbones by 4% on average. Moreover, in comparison to the state-of-the-art, the fusion of the deep features improved the overall results up to 11% in terms of kidney stone classification accuracy."
2211.03199,KGTN-ens: Few-Shot Image Classification with Knowledge Graph Ensembles,"We propose KGTN-ens, a framework extending the recent Knowledge Graph Transfer Network (KGTN) in order to incorporate multiple knowledge graph embeddings at a small cost. We evaluate it with different combinations of embeddings in a few-shot image classification task. We also construct a new knowledge source - Wikidata embeddings - and evaluate it with KGTN and KGTN-ens. Our approach outperforms KGTN in terms of the top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet-FS dataset for the majority of tested settings."
2211.03267,Prompter: Utilizing Large Language Model Prompting for a Data Efficient   Embodied Instruction Following,"Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) studies how autonomous mobile manipulation robots should be controlled to accomplish long-horizon tasks described by natural language instructions. While much research on EIF is conducted in simulators, the ultimate goal of the field is to deploy the agents in real life. This is one of the reasons why recent methods have moved away from training models end-to-end and take modular approaches, which do not need the costly expert operation data. However, as it is still in the early days of importing modular ideas to EIF, a search for modules effective in the EIF task is still far from a conclusion. In this paper, we propose to extend the modular design using knowledge obtained from two external sources. First, we show that embedding the physical constraints of the deployed robots into the module design is highly effective. Our design also allows the same modular system to work across robots of different configurations with minimal modifications. Second, we show that the landmark-based object search, previously implemented by a trained model requiring a dedicated set of data, can be replaced by an implementation that prompts pretrained large language models for landmark-object relationships, eliminating the need for collecting dedicated training data. Our proposed Prompter achieves 41.53\% and 45.32\% on the ALFRED benchmark with high-level instructions only and step-by-step instructions, respectively, significantly outperforming the previous state of the art by 5.46\% and 9.91\%."
2211.03295,MogaNet: Multi-order Gated Aggregation Network,"By contextualizing the kernel as global as possible, Modern ConvNets have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. However, recent progress on \textit{multi-order game-theoretic interaction} within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D\&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0\% and 87.8\% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59\% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/Westlake-AI/MogaNet}."
2211.03679,Body Part-Based Representation Learning for Occluded Person   Re-Identification,"Occluded person re-identification (ReID) is a person retrieval task which aims at matching occluded person images with holistic ones. For addressing occluded ReID, part-based methods have been shown beneficial as they offer fine-grained information and are well suited to represent partially visible human bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for two reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative as global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance), this means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not adapted to local feature learning. Secondly, ReID datasets are not provided with human topographical annotations. In this work, we propose BPBreID, a body part-based ReID model for solving the above issues. We first design two modules for predicting body part attention maps and producing body part-based features of the ReID target. We then propose GiLt, a novel training scheme for learning part-based representations that is robust to occlusions and non-discriminative local appearance. Extensive experiments on popular holistic and occluded datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.7% mAP and 5.6% rank-1 accuracy on the challenging Occluded-Duke dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/VlSomers/bpbreid."
2211.03894,visClust: A visual clustering algorithm based on orthogonal projections,"We present a novel clustering algorithm, visClust, that is based on lower dimensional data representations and visual interpretation. Thereto, we design a transformation that allows the data to be represented by a binary integer array enabling the use of image processing methods to select a partition. Qualitative and quantitative analyses measured in accuracy and an adjusted Rand-Index show that the algorithm performs well while requiring low runtime and RAM. We compare the results to 6 state-of-the-art algorithms with available code, confirming the quality of visClust by superior performance in most experiments. Moreover, the algorithm asks for just one obligatory input parameter while allowing optimization via optional parameters. The code is made available on GitHub and straightforward to use."
2211.04110,Privacy Meets Explainability: A Comprehensive Impact Benchmark,"Since the mid-10s, the era of Deep Learning (DL) has continued to this day, bringing forth new superlatives and innovations each year. Nevertheless, the speed with which these innovations translate into real applications lags behind this fast pace. Safety-critical applications, in particular, underlie strict regulatory and ethical requirements which need to be taken care of and are still active areas of debate. eXplainable AI (XAI) and privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) are both crucial research fields, aiming at mitigating some of the drawbacks of prevailing data-hungry black-box models in DL. Despite brisk research activity in the respective fields, no attention has yet been paid to their interaction. This work is the first to investigate the impact of private learning techniques on generated explanations for DL-based models. In an extensive experimental analysis covering various image and time series datasets from multiple domains, as well as varying privacy techniques, XAI methods, and model architectures, the effects of private training on generated explanations are studied. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in explanations through the introduction of privacy. Apart from reporting individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this work is a first step towards overcoming the remaining hurdles for practically applicable AI in safety-critical domains."
2211.04165,Dynamic loss balancing and sequential enhancement for road-safety   assessment and traffic scene classification,"Road-safety inspection is an indispensable instrument for reducing road-accident fatalities contributed to road infrastructure. Recent work formalizes road-safety assessment in terms of carefully selected risk factors that are also known as road-safety attributes. In current practice, these attributes are manually annotated in geo-referenced monocular video for each road segment. We propose to reduce dependency on tedious human labor by automating recognition with a two-stage neural architecture. The first stage predicts more than forty road-safety attributes by observing a local spatio-temporal context. Our design leverages an efficient convolutional pipeline, which benefits from pre-training on semantic segmentation of street scenes. The second stage enhances predictions through sequential integration across a larger temporal window. Our design leverages per-attribute instances of a lightweight bidirectional LSTM architecture. Both stages alleviate extreme class imbalance by incorporating a multi-task variant of recall-based dynamic loss weighting. We perform experiments on the iRAP-BH dataset, which involves fully labeled geo-referenced video along 2,300 km of public roads in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also validate our approach by comparing it with the related work on two road-scene classification datasets from the literature: Honda Scenes and FM3m. Experimental evaluation confirms the value of our contributions on all three datasets."
2211.04177,Learning advisor networks for noisy image classification,"In this paper, we introduced the novel concept of advisor network to address the problem of noisy labels in image classification. Deep neural networks (DNN) are prone to performance reduction and overfitting problems on training data with noisy annotations. Weighting loss methods aim to mitigate the influence of noisy labels during the training, completely removing their contribution. This discarding process prevents DNNs from learning wrong associations between images and their correct labels but reduces the amount of data used, especially when most of the samples have noisy labels. Differently, our method weighs the feature extracted directly from the classifier without altering the loss value of each data. The advisor helps to focus only on some part of the information present in mislabeled examples, allowing the classifier to leverage that data as well. We trained it with a meta-learning strategy so that it can adapt throughout the training of the main model. We tested our method on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with synthetic noise, and on Clothing1M which contains real-world noise, reporting state-of-the-art results."
2211.04325,Will we run out of data? Limits of LLM scaling based on human-generated   data,"We investigate the potential constraints on LLM scaling posed by the availability of public human-generated text data. We forecast the growing demand for training data based on current trends and estimate the total stock of public human text data. Our findings indicate that if current LLM development trends continue, models will be trained on datasets roughly equal in size to the available stock of public human text data between 2026 and 2032, or slightly earlier if models are overtrained. We explore how progress in language modeling can continue when human-generated text datasets cannot be scaled any further. We argue that synthetic data generation, transfer learning from data-rich domains, and data efficiency improvements might support further progress."
2211.04625,Soft Augmentation for Image Classification,"Modern neural networks are over-parameterized and thus rely on strong regularization such as data augmentation and weight decay to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. The dominant form of data augmentation applies invariant transforms, where the learning target of a sample is invariant to the transform applied to that sample. We draw inspiration from human visual classification studies and propose generalizing augmentation with invariant transforms to soft augmentation where the learning target softens non-linearly as a function of the degree of the transform applied to the sample: e.g., more aggressive image crop augmentations produce less confident learning targets. We demonstrate that soft targets allow for more aggressive data augmentation, offer more robust performance boosts, work with other augmentation policies, and interestingly, produce better calibrated models (since they are trained to be less confident on aggressively cropped/occluded examples). Combined with existing aggressive augmentation strategies, soft target 1) doubles the top-1 accuracy boost across Cifar-10, Cifar-100, ImageNet-1K, and ImageNet-V2, 2) improves model occlusion performance by up to $4\times$, and 3) halves the expected calibration error (ECE). Finally, we show that soft augmentation generalizes to self-supervised classification tasks. Code available at https://github.com/youngleox/soft_augmentation"
2211.04700,Noise Self-Regression: A New Learning Paradigm to Enhance Low-Light   Images Without Task-Related Data,"Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a task of leveraging deep neural networks to enhance the image illumination while keeping the image content unchanged. From the perspective of training data, existing methods complete the LLIE task driven by one of the following three data types: paired data, unpaired data and zero-reference data. Each type of these data-driven methods has its own advantages, e.g., zero-reference data-based methods have very low requirements on training data and can meet the human needs in many scenarios. In this paper, we leverage pure Gaussian noise to complete the LLIE task, which further reduces the requirements for training data in LLIE tasks and can be used as another alternative in practical use. Specifically, we propose Noise SElf-Regression (NoiSER) without access to any task-related data, simply learns a convolutional neural network equipped with an instance-normalization layer by taking a random noise image, $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ for each pixel, as both input and output for each training pair, and then the low-light image is fed to the trained network for predicting the normal-light image. Technically, an intuitive explanation for its effectiveness is as follows: 1) the self-regression reconstructs the contrast between adjacent pixels of the input image, 2) the instance-normalization layer may naturally remediate the overall magnitude/lighting of the input image, and 3) the $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ assumption for each pixel enforces the output image to follow the well-known gray-world hypothesis when the image size is big enough. Compared to current state-of-the-art LLIE methods with access to different task-related data, NoiSER is highly competitive in enhancement quality, yet with a much smaller model size, and much lower training and inference cost. Besides, NoiSER also excels in mitigating overexposure and handling joint tasks."
2211.04718,On the Application of Efficient Neural Mapping to Real-Time Indoor   Localisation for Unmanned Ground Vehicles,"Global localisation from visual data is a challenging problem applicable to many robotics domains. Prior works have shown that neural networks can be trained to map images of an environment to absolute camera pose within that environment, learning an implicit neural mapping in the process. In this work we evaluate the applicability of such an approach to real-world robotics scenarios, demonstrating that by constraining the problem to 2-dimensions and significantly increasing the quantity of training data, a compact model capable of real-time inference on embedded platforms can be used to achieve localisation accuracy of several centimetres. We deploy our trained model onboard a UGV platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in a waypoint navigation task, wherein it is able to localise with a mean accuracy of 9cm at a rate of 6fps running on the UGV onboard CPU, 35fps on an embedded GPU, or 220fps on a desktop GPU. Along with this work we will release a novel localisation dataset comprising simulated and real environments, each with training samples numbering in the tens of thousands."
2211.05207,Improving Clinician Performance in Classification of EEG Patterns on the   Ictal-Interictal-Injury Continuum using Interpretable Machine Learning,"In intensive care units (ICUs), critically ill patients are monitored with electroencephalograms (EEGs) to prevent serious brain injury. The number of patients who can be monitored is constrained by the availability of trained physicians to read EEGs, and EEG interpretation can be subjective and prone to inter-observer variability. Automated deep learning systems for EEG could reduce human bias and accelerate the diagnostic process. However, black box deep learning models are untrustworthy, difficult to troubleshoot, and lack accountability in real-world applications, leading to a lack of trust and adoption by clinicians. To address these challenges, we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model that not only predicts the presence of harmful brainwave patterns but also provides high-quality case-based explanations of its decisions. Our model performs better than the corresponding black box model, despite being constrained to be interpretable. The learned 2D embedded space provides the first global overview of the structure of ictal-interictal-injury continuum brainwave patterns. The ability to understand how our model arrived at its decisions will not only help clinicians to diagnose and treat harmful brain activities more accurately but also increase their trust and adoption of machine learning models in clinical practice; this could be an integral component of the ICU neurologists' standard workflow."
2211.05226,A kinetic approach to consensus-based segmentation of biomedical images,"In this work, we apply a kinetic version of a bounded confidence consensus model to biomedical segmentation problems. In the presented approach, time-dependent information on the microscopic state of each particle/pixel includes its space position and a feature representing a static characteristic of the system, i.e. the gray level of each pixel. From the introduced microscopic model we derive a kinetic formulation of the model. The large time behavior of the system is then computed with the aid of a surrogate Fokker-Planck approach that can be obtained in the quasi-invariant scaling. We exploit the computational efficiency of direct simulation Monte Carlo methods for the obtained Boltzmann-type description of the problem for parameter identification tasks. Based on a suitable loss function measuring the distance between the ground truth segmentation mask and the evaluated mask, we minimize the introduced segmentation metric for a relevant set of 2D gray-scale images. Applications to biomedical segmentation concentrate on different imaging research contexts."
2211.05269,Generative Adversarial Networks for Weakly Supervised Generation and   Evaluation of Brain Tumor Segmentations on MR Images,"Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) for identifying abnormalities is a leading problem in medical imaging. Using machine learning for this problem generally requires manually annotated ground-truth segmentations, demanding extensive time and resources from radiologists. This work presents a weakly supervised approach that utilizes binary image-level labels, which are much simpler to acquire, to effectively segment anomalies in 2D magnetic resonance images without ground truth annotations. We train a generative adversarial network (GAN) that converts cancerous images to healthy variants, which are used along with localization seeds as priors to generate improved weakly supervised segmentations. The non-cancerous variants can also be used to evaluate the segmentations in a weakly supervised fashion, which allows for the most effective segmentations to be identified and then applied to downstream clinical classification tasks. On the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 dataset, our proposed method generates and identifies segmentations that achieve test Dice coefficients of 83.91%. Using these segmentations for pathology classification results with a test AUC of 93.32% which is comparable to the test AUC of 95.80% achieved when using true segmentations."
2211.05421,Improving Uncertainty-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Medical   Image Segmentation,"Deep Learning models are easily disturbed by variations in the input images that were not seen during training, resulting in unpredictable behaviours. Such Out-of-Distribution (OOD) images represent a significant challenge in the context of medical image analysis, where the range of possible abnormalities is extremely wide, including artifacts, unseen pathologies, or different imaging protocols. In this work, we evaluate various uncertainty frameworks to detect OOD inputs in the context of Multiple Sclerosis lesions segmentation. By implementing a comprehensive evaluation scheme including 14 sources of OOD of various nature and strength, we show that methods relying on the predictive uncertainty of binary segmentation models often fails in detecting outlying inputs. On the contrary, learning to segment anatomical labels alongside lesions highly improves the ability to detect OOD inputs."
2211.05617,Debiasing Methods for Fairer Neural Models in Vision and Language Research: A Survey,"Despite being responsible for state-of-the-art results in several computer vision and natural language processing tasks, neural networks have faced harsh criticism due to some of their current shortcomings. One of them is that neural networks are correlation machines prone to model biases within the data instead of focusing on actual useful causal relationships. This problem is particularly serious in application domains affected by aspects such as race, gender, and age. To prevent models from incurring on unfair decision-making, the AI community has concentrated efforts in correcting algorithmic biases, giving rise to the research area now widely known as fairness in AI. In this survey paper, we provide an in-depth overview of the main debiasing methods for fairness-aware neural networks in the context of vision and language research. We propose a novel taxonomy to better organize the literature on debiasing methods for fairness, and we discuss the current challenges, trends, and important future work directions for the interested researcher and practitioner."
2211.05622,InstantGroup: Instant Template Generation for Scalable Group of Brain   MRI Registration,"Template generation is a critical step in groupwise image registration, which involves aligning a group of subjects into a common space. While existing methods can generate high-quality template images, they often incur substantial time costs or are limited by fixed group scales. In this paper, we present InstantGroup, an efficient groupwise template generation framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) models that leverage latent representations' arithmetic properties, enabling scalability to groups of any size. InstantGroup features a Dual VAEs backbone with shared-weight twin networks to handle pairs of inputs and incorporates a Displacement Inversion Module (DIM) to maintain template unbiasedness and a Subject-Template Alignment Module (STAM) to improve template quality and registration accuracy. Experiments on 3D brain MRI scans from the OASIS and ADNI datasets reveal that InstantGroup dramatically reduces runtime, generating templates within seconds for various group sizes while maintaining superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on quantitative metrics, including unbiasedness and registration accuracy."
2211.05716,Resource-Aware Heterogeneous Federated Learning using Neural   Architecture Search,"Federated Learning (FL) is extensively used to train AI/ML models in distributed and privacy-preserving settings. Participant edge devices in FL systems typically contain non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) private data and unevenly distributed computational resources. Preserving user data privacy while optimizing AI/ML models in a heterogeneous federated network requires us to address data and system/resource heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose Resource-aware Federated Learning (RaFL). RaFL allocates resource-aware specialized models to edge devices using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and allows heterogeneous model architecture deployment by knowledge extraction and fusion. Combining NAS and FL enables on-demand customized model deployment for resource-diverse edge devices. Furthermore, we propose a multi-model architecture fusion scheme allowing the aggregation of the distributed learning results. Results demonstrate RaFL's superior resource efficiency compared to SoTA."
2211.05781,Demystify Transformers & Convolutions in Modern Image Deep Networks,"Vision transformers have gained popularity recently, leading to the development of new vision backbones with improved features and consistent performance gains. However, these advancements are not solely attributable to novel feature transformation designs; certain benefits also arise from advanced network-level and block-level architectures. This paper aims to identify the real gains of popular convolution and attention operators through a detailed study. We find that the key difference among these feature transformation modules, such as attention or convolution, lies in their spatial feature aggregation approach, known as the ""spatial token mixer"" (STM). To facilitate an impartial comparison, we introduce a unified architecture to neutralize the impact of divergent network-level and block-level designs. Subsequently, various STMs are integrated into this unified framework for comprehensive comparative analysis. Our experiments on various tasks and an analysis of inductive bias show a significant performance boost due to advanced network-level and block-level designs, but performance differences persist among different STMs. Our detailed analysis also reveals various findings about different STMs, including effective receptive fields, invariance, and adversarial robustness tests."
2211.05884,Employing Graph Representations for Cell-level Characterization of   Melanoma MELC Samples,"Histopathology imaging is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases. For this reason, computer-assisted approaches have gained popularity and shown promising results in tasks such as segmentation and classification of skin disorders. However, collecting essential data and sufficiently high-quality annotations is a challenge. This work describes a pipeline that uses suspected melanoma samples that have been characterized using Multi-Epitope-Ligand Cartography (MELC). This cellular-level tissue characterisation is then represented as a graph and used to train a graph neural network. This imaging technology, combined with the methodology proposed in this work, achieves a classification accuracy of 87%, outperforming existing approaches by 10%."
2211.06088,RepGhost: A Hardware-Efficient Ghost Module via Re-parameterization,"Feature reuse has been a key technique in light-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architecture design. Current methods usually utilize a concatenation operator to keep large channel numbers cheaply (thus large network capacity) by reusing feature maps from other layers. Although concatenation is parameters- and FLOPs-free, its computational cost on hardware devices is non-negligible. To address this, this paper provides a new perspective to realize feature reuse implicitly and more efficiently instead of concatenation. A novel hardware-efficient RepGhost module is proposed for implicit feature reuse via reparameterization, instead of using concatenation operator. Based on the RepGhost module, we develop our efficient RepGhost bottleneck and RepGhostNet. Experiments on ImageNet and COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our RepGhostNet is much more effective and efficient than GhostNet and MobileNetV3 on mobile devices. Specially, our RepGhostNet surpasses GhostNet 0.5x by 2.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset with less parameters and comparable latency on an ARM-based mobile device. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/ChengpengChen/RepGhost."
2211.06108,RaLiBEV: Radar and LiDAR BEV Fusion Learning for Anchor Box Free Object   Detection Systems,"In autonomous driving, LiDAR and radar are crucial for environmental perception. LiDAR offers precise 3D spatial sensing information but struggles in adverse weather like fog. Conversely, radar signals can penetrate rain or mist due to their specific wavelength but are prone to noise disturbances. Recent state-of-the-art works reveal that the fusion of radar and LiDAR can lead to robust detection in adverse weather. The existing works adopt convolutional neural network architecture to extract features from each sensor data, then align and aggregate the two branch features to predict object detection results. However, these methods have low accuracy of predicted bounding boxes due to a simple design of label assignment and fusion strategies. In this paper, we propose a bird's-eye view fusion learning-based anchor box-free object detection system, which fuses the feature derived from the radar range-azimuth heatmap and the LiDAR point cloud to estimate possible objects. Different label assignment strategies have been designed to facilitate the consistency between the classification of foreground or background anchor points and the corresponding bounding box regressions. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed object detector is further enhanced by employing a novel interactive transformer module. The superior performance of the methods proposed in this paper has been demonstrated using the recently published Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset. Our system's average precision significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13.1% and 19.0% at Intersection of Union (IoU) of 0.8 under 'Clear+Foggy' training conditions for 'Clear' and 'Foggy' testing, respectively."
2211.06150,Improved HER2 Tumor Segmentation with Subtype Balancing using Deep   Generative Networks,"Tumor segmentation in histopathology images is often complicated by its composition of different histological subtypes and class imbalance. Oversampling subtypes with low prevalence features is not a satisfactory solution since it eventually leads to overfitting. We propose to create synthetic images with semantically-conditioned deep generative networks and to combine subtype-balanced synthetic images with the original dataset to achieve better segmentation performance. We show the suitability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and especially diffusion models to create realistic images based on subtype-conditioning for the use case of HER2-stained histopathology. Additionally, we show the capability of diffusion models to conditionally inpaint HER2 tumor areas with modified subtypes. Combining the original dataset with the same amount of diffusion-generated images increased the tumor Dice score from 0.833 to 0.854 and almost halved the variance between the HER2 subtype recalls. These results create the basis for more reliable automatic HER2 analysis with lower performance variance between individual HER2 subtypes."
2211.06470,Federated Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning via Exploiting General Content and Personal Style,"Discriminative unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning have demonstrated the ability to learn generalized visual representations on centralized data. It is nonetheless challenging to adapt such methods to a distributed system with unlabeled, private, and heterogeneous client data due to user styles and preferences. Federated learning enables multiple clients to collectively learn a global model without provoking any privacy breach between local clients. On the other hand, another direction of federated learning studies personalized methods to address the local heterogeneity. However, work on solving both generalization and personalization without labels in a decentralized setting remains unfamiliar. In this work, we propose a novel method, FedStyle, to learn a more generalized global model by infusing local style information with local content information for contrastive learning, and to learn more personalized local models by inducing local style information for downstream tasks. The style information is extracted by contrasting original local data with strongly augmented local data (Sobel filtered images). Through extensive experiments with linear evaluations in both IID and non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedStyle outperforms both the generalization baseline methods and personalization baseline methods in a stylized decentralized setting. Through comprehensive ablations, we demonstrate our design of style infusion and stylized personalization improve performance significantly."
2211.06544,Correcting Faulty Road Maps by Image Inpainting,"As maintaining road networks is labor-intensive, many automatic road extraction approaches have been introduced to solve this real-world problem, fueled by the abundance of large-scale high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in computer vision. However, their performance is limited for fully automating the road map extraction in real-world services. Hence, many services employ the two-step human-in-the-loop system to post-process the extracted road maps: error localization and automatic mending for faulty road maps. Our paper exclusively focuses on the latter step, introducing a novel image inpainting approach for fixing road maps with complex road geometries without custom-made heuristics, yielding a method that is readily applicable to any road geometry extraction model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various real-world road geometries, such as straight and curvy roads, T-junctions, and intersections."
2211.06649,Line Drawing Guided Progressive Inpainting of Mural Damage,"Mural image inpainting is far less explored compared to its natural image counterpart and remains largely unsolved. Most existing image-inpainting methods tend to take the target image as the only input and directly repair the damage to generate a visually plausible result. These methods obtain high performance in restoration or completion of some pre-defined objects, e.g., human face, fabric texture, and printed texts, etc., however, are not suitable for repairing murals with varying subjects and large damaged areas. Moreover, due to discrete colors in paints, mural inpainting may suffer from apparent color bias. To this end, in this paper, we propose a line drawing guided progressive mural inpainting method. It divides the inpainting process into two steps: structure reconstruction and color correction, implemented by a structure reconstruction network (SRN) and a color correction network (CCN), respectively. In structure reconstruction, SRN utilizes the line drawing as an assistant to achieve large-scale content authenticity and structural stability. In color correction, CCN operates a local color adjustment for missing pixels which reduces the negative effects of color bias and edge jumping. The proposed approach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art image inpainting methods. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in mural image inpainting. The codes and data are available at https://github.com/qinnzou/mural-image-inpainting."
2211.06757,DriftRec: Adapting diffusion models to blind JPEG restoration,"In this work, we utilize the high-fidelity generation abilities of diffusion models to solve blind JPEG restoration at high compression levels. We propose an elegant modification of the forward stochastic differential equation of diffusion models to adapt them to this restoration task and name our method DriftRec. Comparing DriftRec against an $L_2$ regression baseline with the same network architecture and state-of-the-art techniques for JPEG restoration, we show that our approach can escape the tendency of other methods to generate blurry images, and recovers the distribution of clean images significantly more faithfully. For this, only a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs and no knowledge about the corruption operation is required, enabling wider applicability to other restoration tasks. In contrast to other conditional and unconditional diffusion models, we utilize the idea that the distributions of clean and corrupted images are much closer to each other than each is to the usual Gaussian prior of the reverse process in diffusion models. Our approach therefore requires only low levels of added noise and needs comparatively few sampling steps even without further optimizations. We show that DriftRec naturally generalizes to realistic and difficult scenarios such as unaligned double JPEG compression and blind restoration of JPEGs found online, without having encountered such examples during training."
2211.06797,Perceptual Video Coding for Machines via Satisfied Machine Ratio   Modeling,"Video Coding for Machines (VCM) aims to compress visual signals for machine analysis. However, existing methods only consider a few machines, neglecting the majority. Moreover, the machine's perceptual characteristics are not leveraged effectively, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Satisfied Machine Ratio (SMR), a metric that statistically evaluates the perceptual quality of compressed images and videos for machines by aggregating satisfaction scores from them. Each score is derived from machine perceptual differences between original and compressed images. Targeting image classification and object detection tasks, we build two representative machine libraries for SMR annotation and create a large-scale SMR dataset to facilitate SMR studies. We then propose an SMR prediction model based on the correlation between deep feature differences and SMR. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task to increase the prediction accuracy by predicting the SMR difference between two images in different quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMR models significantly improve compression performance for machines and exhibit robust generalizability on unseen machines, codecs, datasets, and frame types. SMR enables perceptual coding for machines and propels VCM from specificity to generality. Code is available at https://github.com/ywwynm/SMR."
2211.06841,Point-DAE: Denoising Autoencoders for Self-supervised Point Cloud   Learning,"Masked autoencoder has demonstrated its effectiveness in self-supervised point cloud learning. Considering that masking is a kind of corruption, in this work we explore a more general denoising autoencoder for point cloud learning (Point-DAE) by investigating more types of corruptions beyond masking. Specifically, we degrade the point cloud with certain corruptions as input, and learn an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the original point cloud from its corrupted version. Three corruption families (\ie, density/masking, noise, and affine transformation) and a total of fourteen corruption types are investigated with traditional non-Transformer encoders. Besides the popular masking corruption, we identify another effective corruption family, \ie, affine transformation. The affine transformation disturbs all points globally, which is complementary to the masking corruption where some local regions are dropped. We also validate the effectiveness of affine transformation corruption with the Transformer backbones, where we decompose the reconstruction of the complete point cloud into the reconstructions of detailed local patches and rough global shape, alleviating the position leakage problem in the reconstruction. Extensive experiments on tasks of object classification, few-shot learning, robustness testing, part segmentation, and 3D object detection validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/Point-DAE}."
2211.07245,Assessing Uncertainty in Similarity Scoring: Performance & Fairness in   Face Recognition,"The ROC curve is the major tool for assessing not only the performance but also the fairness properties of a similarity scoring function. In order to draw reliable conclusions based on empirical ROC analysis, accurately evaluating the uncertainty level related to statistical versions of the ROC curves of interest is absolutely necessary, especially for applications with considerable societal impact such as Face Recognition. In this article, we prove asymptotic guarantees for empirical ROC curves of similarity functions as well as for by-product metrics useful to assess fairness. We also explain that, because the false acceptance/rejection rates are of the form of U-statistics in the case of similarity scoring, the naive bootstrap approach may jeopardize the assessment procedure. A dedicated recentering technique must be used instead. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, various experiments using real face image datasets provide strong empirical evidence of the practical relevance of the methods promoted here, when applied to several ROC-based measures such as popular fairness metrics."
2211.07273,MLIC: Multi-Reference Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression,"Recently, learned image compression has achieved remarkable performance. The entropy model, which estimates the distribution of the latent representation, plays a crucial role in boosting rate-distortion performance. However, most entropy models only capture correlations in one dimension, while the latent representation contain channel-wise, local spatial, and global spatial correlations. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Reference Entropy Model (MEM) and the advanced version, MEM$^+$. These models capture the different types of correlations present in latent representation. Specifically, We first divide the latent representation into slices. When decoding the current slice, we use previously decoded slices as context and employ the attention map of the previously decoded slice to predict global correlations in the current slice. To capture local contexts, we introduce two enhanced checkerboard context capturing techniques that avoids performance degradation. Based on MEM and MEM$^+$, we propose image compression models MLIC and MLIC$^+$. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our MLIC and MLIC$^+$ models achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing BD-rate by $8.05\%$ and $11.39\%$ on the Kodak dataset compared to VTM-17.0 when measured in PSNR. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiangWeibeta/MLIC."
2211.07365,Detecting Line Segments in Motion-blurred Images with Events,"Making line segment detectors more reliable under motion blurs is one of the most important challenges for practical applications, such as visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction. Existing line segment detection methods face severe performance degradation for accurately detecting and locating line segments when motion blur occurs. While event data shows strong complementary characteristics to images for minimal blur and edge awareness at high-temporal resolution, potentially beneficial for reliable line segment recognition. To robustly detect line segments over motion blurs, we propose to leverage the complementary information of images and events. To achieve this, we first design a general frame-event feature fusion network to extract and fuse the detailed image textures and low-latency event edges, which consists of a channel-attention-based shallow fusion module and a self-attention-based dual hourglass module. We then utilize two state-of-the-art wireframe parsing networks to detect line segments on the fused feature map. Besides, we contribute a synthetic and a realistic dataset for line segment detection, i.e., FE-Wireframe and FE-Blurframe, with pairwise motion-blurred images and events. Extensive experiments on both datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. When tested on the real dataset, our method achieves 63.3% mean structural average precision (msAP) with the model pre-trained on the FE-Wireframe and fine-tuned on the FE-Blurframe, improved by 32.6 and 11.3 points compared with models trained on synthetic only and real only, respectively. The codes, datasets, and trained models are released at: https://levenberg.github.io/FE-LSD"
2211.07386,Unsupervised Method for Intra-patient Registration of Brain Magnetic   Resonance Images based on Objective Function Weighting by Inverse   Consistency: Contribution to the BraTS-Reg Challenge,"Registration of brain scans with pathologies is difficult, yet important research area. The importance of this task motivated researchers to organize the BraTS-Reg challenge, jointly with IEEE ISBI 2022 and MICCAI 2022 conferences. The organizers introduced the task of aligning pre-operative to follow-up magnetic resonance images of glioma. The main difficulties are connected with the missing data leading to large, nonrigid, and noninvertible deformations. In this work, we describe our contributions to both the editions of the BraTS-Reg challenge. The proposed method is based on combined deep learning and instance optimization approaches. First, the instance optimization enriches the state-of-the-art LapIRN method to improve the generalizability and fine-details preservation. Second, an additional objective function weighting is introduced, based on the inverse consistency. The proposed method is fully unsupervised and exhibits high registration quality and robustness. The quantitative results on the external validation set are: (i) IEEE ISBI 2022 edition: 1.85, and 0.86, (ii) MICCAI 2022 edition: 1.71, and 0.86, in terms of the mean of median absolute error and robustness respectively. The method scored the 1st place during the IEEE ISBI 2022 version of the challenge and the 3rd place during the MICCAI 2022. Future work could transfer the inverse consistency-based weighting directly into the deep network training."
2211.07394,Composed Image Retrieval with Text Feedback via Multi-grained   Uncertainty Regularization,"We investigate composed image retrieval with text feedback. Users gradually look for the target of interest by moving from coarse to fine-grained feedback. However, existing methods merely focus on the latter, i.e., fine-grained search, by harnessing positive and negative pairs during training. This pair-based paradigm only considers the one-to-one distance between a pair of specific points, which is not aligned with the one-to-many coarse-grained retrieval process and compromises the recall rate. In an attempt to fill this gap, we introduce a unified learning approach to simultaneously modeling the coarse- and fine-grained retrieval by considering the multi-grained uncertainty. The key idea underpinning the proposed method is to integrate fine- and coarse-grained retrieval as matching data points with small and large fluctuations, respectively. Specifically, our method contains two modules: uncertainty modeling and uncertainty regularization. (1) The uncertainty modeling simulates the multi-grained queries by introducing identically distributed fluctuations in the feature space. (2) Based on the uncertainty modeling, we further introduce uncertainty regularization to adapt the matching objective according to the fluctuation range. Compared with existing methods, the proposed strategy explicitly prevents the model from pushing away potential candidates in the early stage, and thus improves the recall rate. On the three public datasets, i.e., FashionIQ, Fashion200k, and Shoes, the proposed method has achieved +4.03%, +3.38%, and +2.40% Recall@50 accuracy over a strong baseline, respectively."
2211.07440,Leveraging Automatic Personalised Nutrition: Food Image Recognition   Benchmark and Dataset based on Nutrition Taxonomy,"Maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become increasingly challenging in today's sedentary society marked by poor eating habits. To address this issue, both national and international organisations have made numerous efforts to promote healthier diets and increased physical activity. However, implementing these recommendations in daily life can be difficult, as they are often generic and not tailored to individuals. This study presents the AI4Food-NutritionDB database, the first nutrition database that incorporates food images and a nutrition taxonomy based on recommendations by national and international health authorities. The database offers a multi-level categorisation, comprising 6 nutritional levels, 19 main categories (e.g., ""Meat""), 73 subcategories (e.g., ""White Meat""), and 893 specific food products (e.g., ""Chicken""). The AI4Food-NutritionDB opens the doors to new food computing approaches in terms of food intake frequency, quality, and categorisation. Also, we present a standardised experimental protocol and benchmark including three tasks based on the nutrition taxonomy (i.e., category, subcategory, and final product recognition). These resources are available to the research community, including our deep learning models trained on AI4Food-NutritionDB, which can serve as pre-trained models, achieving accurate recognition results for challenging food image databases."
2211.07459,Self-Aligning Depth-regularized Radiance Fields for Asynchronous RGB-D   Sequences,"It has been shown that learning radiance fields with depth rendering and depth supervision can effectively promote the quality and convergence of view synthesis. However, this paradigm requires input RGB-D sequences to be synchronized, hindering its usage in the UAV city modeling scenario. As there exists asynchrony between RGB images and depth images due to high-speed flight, we propose a novel time-pose function, which is an implicit network that maps timestamps to $\rm SE(3)$ elements. To simplify the training process, we also design a joint optimization scheme to jointly learn the large-scale depth-regularized radiance fields and the time-pose function. Our algorithm consists of three steps: (1) time-pose function fitting, (2) radiance field bootstrapping, (3) joint pose error compensation and radiance field refinement. In addition, we propose a large synthetic dataset with diverse controlled mismatches and ground truth to evaluate this new problem setting systematically. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines without regularization. We also show qualitatively improved results on a real-world asynchronous RGB-D sequence captured by drone. Codes, data, and models will be made publicly available."
2211.07546,Vision meets algae: A novel way for microalgae recognization and health   monitor,"Marine microalgae are widespread in the ocean and play a crucial role in the ecosystem. Automatic identification and location of marine microalgae in microscopy images would help establish marine ecological environment monitoring and water quality evaluation system. We proposed a new dataset for the detection of marine microalgae and a range of detection methods, the dataset including images of different genus of algae and the same genus in different states. We set the number of unbalanced classes in the data set and added images of mixed water samples in the test set to simulate the actual situation in the field. Then we trained, validated and tested the, TOOD, YOLOv5, YOLOv8 and variants of RCNN algorithms on this dataset. The results showed both one-stage and two-stage object detection models can achieve high mean average precision, which proves the ability of computer vision in multi-object detection of microalgae, and provides basic data and models for real-time detection of microalgal cells."
2211.07748,3D Reconstruction-Based Seed Counting of Sorghum Panicles for   Agricultural Inspection,"In this paper, we present a method for creating high-quality 3D models of sorghum panicles for phenotyping in breeding experiments. This is achieved with a novel reconstruction approach that uses seeds as semantic landmarks in both 2D and 3D. To evaluate the performance, we develop a new metric for assessing the quality of reconstructed point clouds without having a ground-truth point cloud. Finally, a counting method is presented where the density of seed centers in the 3D model allows 2D counts from multiple views to be effectively combined into a whole-panicle count. We demonstrate that using this method to estimate seed count and weight for sorghum outperforms count extrapolation from 2D images, an approach used in most state of the art methods for seeds and grains of comparable size."
2211.07864,Federated Adaptive Prompt Tuning for Multi-Domain Collaborative Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their data. Previous researches often require training the complete model parameters. However, the emergence of powerful pre-trained models makes it possible to achieve higher performance with fewer learnable parameters in FL. In this paper, we propose a federated adaptive prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for multi-domain collaborative image classification with powerful foundation models, like CLIP. Compared with direct federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively unlock specific domain knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them with personalized prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt tuning module, which consists of a meta prompt, an adaptive network, and some keys. The server randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to each client. Then all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network and meta prompt with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the global aggregation model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the domain features of each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two multi-domain image classification datasets across two different settings -- supervised and unsupervised. The results show that FedAPT can achieve better performance with less than 10\% of the number of parameters of the fully trained model, and the global model can perform well in diverse client domains simultaneously. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/leondada/FedAPT}."
2211.07955,IntegratedPIFu: Integrated Pixel Aligned Implicit Function for   Single-view Human Reconstruction,"We propose IntegratedPIFu, a new pixel aligned implicit model that builds on the foundation set by PIFuHD. IntegratedPIFu shows how depth and human parsing information can be predicted and capitalised upon in a pixel-aligned implicit model. In addition, IntegratedPIFu introduces depth oriented sampling, a novel training scheme that improve any pixel aligned implicit model ability to reconstruct important human features without noisy artefacts. Lastly, IntegratedPIFu presents a new architecture that, despite using less model parameters than PIFuHD, is able to improves the structural correctness of reconstructed meshes. Our results show that IntegratedPIFu significantly outperforms existing state of the arts methods on single view human reconstruction. Our code has been made available online."
2211.08007,Evidence-based Match-status-Aware Gait Recognition for Out-of-Gallery   Gait Identification,"Existing gait recognition methods typically identify individuals based on the similarity between probe and gallery samples. However, these methods often neglect the fact that the gallery may not contain identities corresponding to the probes, leading to incorrect recognition.To identify Out-of-Gallery (OOG) gait queries, we propose an Evidence-based Match-status-Aware Gait Recognition (EMA-GR) framework. Inspired by Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), EMA-GR is designed to quantify the uncertainty associated with the match status of recognition. Thus, EMA-GR identifies whether the probe has a counterpart in the gallery. Specifically, we adopt an evidence collector to gather match status evidence from a recognition result pair and parameterize a Dirichlet distribution over the gathered evidence, following the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST). We measure the uncertainty and predict the match status of the recognition results, and thus determine whether the probe is an OOG query.To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to tackle OOG queries in gait recognition. Moreover, EMA-GR is agnostic against gait recognition methods and improves the robustness against OOG queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets with OOG queries, and can also generalize well to other identity-retrieval tasks. Importantly, our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, achieving a 51.26% improvement when the OOG query rate is around 50% on OUMVLP."
2211.08089,DeS3: Adaptive Attention-driven Self and Soft Shadow Removal using ViT   Similarity,"Removing soft and self shadows that lack clear boundaries from a single image is still challenging. Self shadows are shadows that are cast on the object itself. Most existing methods rely on binary shadow masks, without considering the ambiguous boundaries of soft and self shadows. In this paper, we present DeS3, a method that removes hard, soft and self shadows based on adaptive attention and ViT similarity. Our novel ViT similarity loss utilizes features extracted from a pre-trained Vision Transformer. This loss helps guide the reverse sampling towards recovering scene structures. Our adaptive attention is able to differentiate shadow regions from the underlying objects, as well as shadow regions from the object casting the shadow. This capability enables DeS3 to better recover the structures of objects even when they are partially occluded by shadows. Different from existing methods that rely on constraints during the training phase, we incorporate the ViT similarity during the sampling stage. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the SRD, AISTD, LRSS, USR and UIUC datasets, removing hard, soft, and self shadows robustly. Specifically, our method outperforms the SOTA method by 16\% of the RMSE of the whole image on the LRSS dataset. Our data and code is available at: \url{https://github.com/jinyeying/DeS3_Deshadow}"
2211.08229,CorruptEncoder: Data Poisoning based Backdoor Attacks to Contrastive   Learning,"Contrastive learning (CL) pre-trains general-purpose encoders using an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which consists of images or image-text pairs. CL is vulnerable to data poisoning based backdoor attacks (DPBAs), in which an attacker injects poisoned inputs into the pre-training dataset so the encoder is backdoored. However, existing DPBAs achieve limited effectiveness. In this work, we take the first step to analyze the limitations of existing backdoor attacks and propose new DPBAs called CorruptEncoder to CL. CorruptEncoder introduces a new attack strategy to create poisoned inputs and uses a theory-guided method to maximize attack effectiveness. Our experiments show that CorruptEncoder substantially outperforms existing DPBAs. In particular, CorruptEncoder is the first DPBA that achieves more than 90% attack success rates with only a few (3) reference images and a small poisoning ratio 0.5%. Moreover, we also propose a defense, called localized cropping, to defend against DPBAs. Our results show that our defense can reduce the effectiveness of DPBAs, but it sacrifices the utility of the encoder, highlighting the need for new defenses."
2211.08332,"Versatile Diffusion: Text, Images and Variations All in One Diffusion   Model","Recent advances in diffusion models have set an impressive milestone in many generation tasks, and trending works such as DALL-E2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion have attracted great interest. Despite the rapid landscape changes, recent new approaches focus on extensions and performance rather than capacity, thus requiring separate models for separate tasks. In this work, we expand the existing single-flow diffusion pipeline into a multi-task multimodal network, dubbed Versatile Diffusion (VD), that handles multiple flows of text-to-image, image-to-text, and variations in one unified model. The pipeline design of VD instantiates a unified multi-flow diffusion framework, consisting of sharable and swappable layer modules that enable the crossmodal generality beyond images and text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VD successfully achieves the following: a) VD outperforms the baseline approaches and handles all its base tasks with competitive quality; b) VD enables novel extensions such as disentanglement of style and semantics, dual- and multi-context blending, etc.; c) The success of our multi-flow multimodal framework over images and text may inspire further diffusion-based universal AI research. Our code and models are open-sourced at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Versatile-Diffusion."
2211.08559,Robust Alzheimer's Progression Modeling using Cross-Domain   Self-Supervised Deep Learning,"Developing successful artificial intelligence systems in practice depends on both robust deep learning models and large, high-quality data. However, acquiring and labeling data can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming in many real-world applications, such as clinical disease models. Self-supervised learning has demonstrated great potential in increasing model accuracy and robustness in small data regimes. In addition, many clinical imaging and disease modeling applications rely heavily on regression of continuous quantities. However, the applicability of self-supervised learning for these medical-imaging regression tasks has not been extensively studied. In this study, we develop a cross-domain self-supervised learning approach for disease prognostic modeling as a regression problem using medical images as input. We demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining can improve the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease progression from brain MRI. We also show that pretraining on extended (but not labeled) brain MRI data outperforms pretraining on natural images. We further observe that the highest performance is achieved when both natural images and extended brain-MRI data are used for pretraining."
2211.08672,Mitigating Urban-Rural Disparities in Contrastive Representation   Learning with Satellite Imagery,"Satellite imagery is being leveraged for many societally critical tasks across climate, economics, and public health. Yet, because of heterogeneity in landscapes (e.g. how a road looks in different places), models can show disparate performance across geographic areas. Given the important potential of disparities in algorithmic systems used in societal contexts, here we consider the risk of urban-rural disparities in identification of land-cover features. This is via semantic segmentation (a common computer vision task in which image regions are labelled according to what is being shown) which uses pre-trained image representations generated via contrastive self-supervised learning. We propose fair dense representation with contrastive learning (FairDCL) as a method for de-biasing the multi-level latent space of convolution neural network models. The method improves feature identification by removing spurious model representations which are disparately distributed across urban and rural areas, and is achieved in an unsupervised way by contrastive pre-training. The obtained image representation mitigates downstream urban-rural prediction disparities and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on real-world satellite images. Embedding space evaluation and ablation studies further demonstrate FairDCL's robustness. As generalizability and robustness in geographic imagery is a nascent topic, our work motivates researchers to consider metrics beyond average accuracy in such applications."
2211.08824,SMILEtrack: SiMIlarity LEarning for Occlusion-Aware Multiple Object   Tracking,"Despite recent progress in Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), several obstacles such as occlusions, similar objects, and complex scenes remain an open challenge. Meanwhile, a systematic study of the cost-performance tradeoff for the popular tracking-by-detection paradigm is still lacking. This paper introduces SMILEtrack, an innovative object tracker that effectively addresses these challenges by integrating an efficient object detector with a Siamese network-based Similarity Learning Module (SLM). The technical contributions of SMILETrack are twofold. First, we propose an SLM that calculates the appearance similarity between two objects, overcoming the limitations of feature descriptors in Separate Detection and Embedding (SDE) models. The SLM incorporates a Patch Self-Attention (PSA) block inspired by the vision Transformer, which generates reliable features for accurate similarity matching. Second, we develop a Similarity Matching Cascade (SMC) module with a novel GATE function for robust object matching across consecutive video frames, further enhancing MOT performance. Together, these innovations help SMILETrack achieve an improved trade-off between the cost ({\em e.g.}, running speed) and performance (e.g., tracking accuracy) over several existing state-of-the-art benchmarks, including the popular BYTETrack method. SMILETrack outperforms BYTETrack by 0.4-0.8 MOTA and 2.1-2.2 HOTA points on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/pingyang1117/SMILEtrack_Official"
2211.08944,"Reasons for the Superiority of Stochastic Estimators over Deterministic   Ones: Robustness, Consistency and Perceptual Quality","Stochastic restoration algorithms allow to explore the space of solutions that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic. Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability. These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms."
2211.09022,Label-Efficient Object Detection via Region Proposal Network   Pre-Training,"Self-supervised pre-training, based on the pretext task of instance discrimination, has fueled the recent advance in label-efficient object detection. However, existing studies focus on pre-training only a feature extractor network to learn transferable representations for downstream detection tasks. This leads to the necessity of training multiple detection-specific modules from scratch in the fine-tuning phase. We argue that the region proposal network (RPN), a common detection-specific module, can additionally be pre-trained towards reducing the localization error of multi-stage detectors. In this work, we propose a simple pretext task that provides an effective pre-training for the RPN, towards efficiently improving downstream object detection performance. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on benchmark object detection tasks and additional downstream tasks, including instance segmentation and few-shot detection. In comparison with multi-stage detectors without RPN pre-training, our approach is able to consistently improve downstream task performance, with largest gains found in label-scarce settings."
2211.09107,Interpretable Few-shot Learning with Online Attribute Selection,"Few-shot learning (FSL) presents a challenging learning problem in which only a few samples are available for each class. Decision interpretation is more important in few-shot classification due to a greater chance of error compared to traditional classification. However, the majority of the previous FSL methods are black-box models. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable model for FSL based on human-friendly attributes. Previously, human-friendly attributes have been utilized to train models with the potential for human interaction and interpretability. However, such approaches are not directly extendible to the few-shot classification scenario. Moreover, we propose an online attribute selection mechanism to effectively filter out irrelevant attributes in each episode. The attribute selection mechanism improves accuracy and helps with interpretability by reducing the number of attributes that participate in each episode. We further propose a mechanism that automatically detects the episodes where the pool of available human-friendly attributes is insufficient, and subsequently augments it by engaging some learned unknown attributes. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results on par with black-box few-shot learning models on four widely used datasets. We also empirically evaluate the level of decision alignment between different models and human understanding and show that our model outperforms the comparison methods based on this criterion."
2211.09310,Language-Assisted Deep Learning for Autistic Behaviors Recognition,"Correctly recognizing the behaviors of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is of vital importance for the diagnosis of Autism and timely early intervention. However, the observation and recording during the treatment from the parents of autistic children may not be accurate and objective. In such cases, automatic recognition systems based on computer vision and machine learning (in particular deep learning) technology can alleviate this issue to a large extent. Existing human action recognition models can now achieve persuasive performance on challenging activity datasets, e.g. daily activity, and sports activity. However, problem behaviors in children with ASD are very different from these general activities, and recognizing these problem behaviors via computer vision is less studied. In this paper, we first evaluate a strong baseline for action recognition, i.e. Video Swin Transformer, on two autism behaviors datasets (SSBD and ESBD) and show that it can achieve high accuracy and outperform the previous methods by a large margin, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-based problem behaviors recognition. Moreover, we propose language-assisted training to further enhance the action recognition performance. Specifically, we develop a two-branch multimodal deep learning framework by incorporating the ""freely available"" language description for each type of problem behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating additional language supervision can bring an obvious performance boost for the autism problem behaviors recognition task as compared to using the video information only (i.e. 3.49% improvement on ESBD and 1.46% on SSBD)."
2211.09321,Interpretable Dimensionality Reduction by Feature Preserving Manifold   Approximation and Projection,"Nonlinear dimensionality reduction lacks interpretability due to the absence of source features in low-dimensional embedding space. We propose an interpretable method featMAP to preserve source features by tangent space embedding. The core of our proposal is to utilize local singular value decomposition (SVD) to approximate the tangent space which is embedded to low-dimensional space by maintaining the alignment. Based on the embedding tangent space, featMAP enables the interpretability by locally demonstrating the source features and feature importance. Furthermore, featMAP embeds the data points by anisotropic projection to preserve the local similarity and original density. We apply featMAP to interpreting digit classification, object detection and MNIST adversarial examples. FeatMAP uses source features to explicitly distinguish the digits and objects and to explain the misclassification of adversarial examples. We also compare featMAP with other state-of-the-art methods on local and global metrics."
2211.09325,TAX-Pose: Task-Specific Cross-Pose Estimation for Robot Manipulation,"How do we imbue robots with the ability to efficiently manipulate unseen objects and transfer relevant skills based on demonstrations? End-to-end learning methods often fail to generalize to novel objects or unseen configurations. Instead, we focus on the task-specific pose relationship between relevant parts of interacting objects. We conjecture that this relationship is a generalizable notion of a manipulation task that can transfer to new objects in the same category; examples include the relationship between the pose of a pan relative to an oven or the pose of a mug relative to a mug rack. We call this task-specific pose relationship ""cross-pose"" and provide a mathematical definition of this concept. We propose a vision-based system that learns to estimate the cross-pose between two objects for a given manipulation task using learned cross-object correspondences. The estimated cross-pose is then used to guide a downstream motion planner to manipulate the objects into the desired pose relationship (placing a pan into the oven or the mug onto the mug rack). We demonstrate our method's capability to generalize to unseen objects, in some cases after training on only 10 demonstrations in the real world. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world experiments across a number of tasks. Supplementary information and videos can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/tax-pose/home."
2211.09480,ArcAid: Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts using Drawings,"Archaeology is an intriguing domain for computer vision. It suffers not only from shortage in (labeled) data, but also from highly-challenging data, which is often extremely abraded and damaged. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised model for classification and retrieval of images of archaeological artifacts. This model utilizes unique data that exists in the domain -- manual drawings made by special artists. These are used during training to implicitly transfer the domain knowledge from the drawings to their corresponding images, improving their classification results. We show that while learning how to classify, our model also learns how to generate drawings of the artifacts, an important documentation task, which is currently performed manually. Last but not least, we collected a new dataset of stamp-seals of the Southern Levant. Our code and dataset are publicly available."
2211.09566,Enabling Collagen Quantification on HE-stained Slides Through Stain   Deconvolution and Restained HE-HES,"In histology, the presence of collagen in the extra-cellular matrix has both diagnostic and prognostic value for cancer malignancy, and can be highlighted by adding Saffron (S) to a routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining. However, Saffron is not usually added because of the additional cost and because pathologists are accustomed to HE, with the exception of France-based laboratories. In this paper, we show that it is possible to quantify the collagen content from the HE image alone and to digitally create an HES image. To do so, we trained a UNet to predict the Saffron densities from HE images. We created a dataset of registered, restained HE-HES slides and we extracted the Saffron concentrations as ground truth using stain deconvolution on the HES images. Our model reached a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0668 $\pm$ 0.0002 (Saffron values between 0 and 1) on a 3-fold testing set. We hope our approach can aid in improving the clinical workflow while reducing reagent costs for laboratories."
2211.09593,NorMatch: Matching Normalizing Flows with Discriminative Classifiers for   Semi-Supervised Learning,"Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) aims to learn a model using a tiny labeled set and massive amounts of unlabeled data. To better exploit the unlabeled data the latest SSL methods use pseudo-labels predicted from a single discriminative classifier. However, the generated pseudo-labels are inevitably linked to inherent confirmation bias and noise which greatly affects the model performance. In this work we introduce a new framework for SSL named NorMatch. Firstly, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation scheme based on normalizing flows, as an auxiliary classifier, to enforce highly certain pseudo-labels yielding a boost of the discriminative classifiers. Secondly, we introduce a threshold-free sample weighting strategy to exploit better both high and low confidence pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we utilize normalizing flows to model, in an unsupervised fashion, the distribution of unlabeled data. This modelling assumption can further improve the performance of generative classifiers via unlabeled data, and thus, implicitly contributing to training a better discriminative classifier. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual results, that NorMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets."
2211.09771,Boosting Object Representation Learning via Motion and Object Continuity,"Recent unsupervised multi-object detection models have shown impressive performance improvements, largely attributed to novel architectural inductive biases. Unfortunately, they may produce suboptimal object encodings for downstream tasks. To overcome this, we propose to exploit object motion and continuity, i.e., objects do not pop in and out of existence. This is accomplished through two mechanisms: (i) providing priors on the location of objects through integration of optical flow, and (ii) a contrastive object continuity loss across consecutive image frames. Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) scheme can be instantiated using any baseline object detection model. Our results show large improvements in the performances of a SOTA model in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction."
2211.09782,Assessing Neural Network Robustness via Adversarial Pivotal Tuning,"The robustness of image classifiers is essential to their deployment in the real world. The ability to assess this resilience to manipulations or deviations from the training data is thus crucial. These modifications have traditionally consisted of minimal changes that still manage to fool classifiers, and modern approaches are increasingly robust to them. Semantic manipulations that modify elements of an image in meaningful ways have thus gained traction for this purpose. However, they have primarily been limited to style, color, or attribute changes. While expressive, these manipulations do not make use of the full capabilities of a pretrained generative model. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap. We show how a pretrained image generator can be used to semantically manipulate images in a detailed, diverse, and photorealistic way while still preserving the class of the original image. Inspired by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method called Adversarial Pivotal Tuning (APT). Given an image, APT first finds a pivot latent space input that reconstructs the image using a pretrained generator. It then adjusts the generator's weights to create small yet semantic manipulations in order to fool a pretrained classifier. APT preserves the full expressive editing capabilities of the generative model. We demonstrate that APT is capable of a wide range of class-preserving semantic image manipulations that fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. Finally, we show that classifiers that are robust to other benchmarks are not robust to APT manipulations and suggest a method to improve them. Code available at: https://captaine.github.io/apt/"
2211.09869,"RenderDiffusion: Image Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction, Inpainting and   Generation","Diffusion models currently achieve state-of-the-art performance for both conditional and unconditional image generation. However, so far, image diffusion models do not support tasks required for 3D understanding, such as view-consistent 3D generation or single-view object reconstruction. In this paper, we present RenderDiffusion, the first diffusion model for 3D generation and inference, trained using only monocular 2D supervision. Central to our method is a novel image denoising architecture that generates and renders an intermediate three-dimensional representation of a scene in each denoising step. This enforces a strong inductive structure within the diffusion process, providing a 3D consistent representation while only requiring 2D supervision. The resulting 3D representation can be rendered from any view. We evaluate RenderDiffusion on FFHQ, AFHQ, ShapeNet and CLEVR datasets, showing competitive performance for generation of 3D scenes and inference of 3D scenes from 2D images. Additionally, our diffusion-based approach allows us to use 2D inpainting to edit 3D scenes."
2211.10227,Adversarial Detection by Approximation of Ensemble Boundary,"Despite being effective in many application areas, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to being attacked. In object recognition, the attack takes the form of a small perturbation added to an image, that causes the DNN to misclassify, but to a human appears no different. Adversarial attacks lead to defences that are themselves subject to attack, and the attack/ defence strategies provide important information about the properties of DNNs. In this paper, a novel method of detecting adversarial attacks is proposed for an ensemble of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) solving two-class pattern recognition problems. The ensemble is combined using Walsh coefficients which are capable of approximating Boolean functions and thereby controlling the decision boundary complexity. The hypothesis in this paper is that decision boundaries with high curvature allow adversarial perturbations to be found, but change the curvature of the decision boundary, which is then approximated in a different way by Walsh coefficients compared to the clean images. Besides controlling boundary complexity, the coefficients also measure the correlation with class labels, which may aid in understanding the learning and transferability properties of DNNs. While the experiments here use images, the proposed approach of modelling two-class ensemble decision boundaries could in principle be applied to any application area."
2211.10307,SeaTurtleID2022: A long-span dataset for reliable sea turtle   re-identification,"This paper introduces the first public large-scale, long-span dataset with sea turtle photographs captured in the wild -- \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wildlifedatasets/seaturtleid2022}{SeaTurtleID2022}. The dataset contains 8729 photographs of 438 unique individuals collected within 13 years, making it the longest-spanned dataset for animal re-identification. All photographs include various annotations, e.g., identity, encounter timestamp, and body parts segmentation masks. Instead of standard ""random"" splits, the dataset allows for two realistic and ecologically motivated splits: (i) a \textit{time-aware closed-set} with training, validation, and test data from different days/years, and (ii) a \textit{time-aware open-set} with new unknown individuals in test and validation sets. We show that time-aware splits are essential for benchmarking re-identification methods, as random splits lead to performance overestimation. Furthermore, a baseline instance segmentation and re-identification performance over various body parts is provided. Finally, an end-to-end system for sea turtle re-identification is proposed and evaluated. The proposed system based on Hybrid Task Cascade for head instance segmentation and ArcFace-trained feature-extractor achieved an accuracy of 86.8\%."
2211.10412,Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Deep Learning: A Comprehensive   Survey,"Video analysis tasks such as action recognition have received increasing research interest with growing applications in fields such as smart healthcare, thanks to the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep learning-based representations. However, video models trained on existing datasets suffer from significant performance degradation when deployed directly to real-world applications due to domain shifts between the training public video datasets (source video domains) and real-world videos (target video domains). Further, with the high cost of video annotation, it is more practical to use unlabeled videos for training. To tackle performance degradation and address concerns in high video annotation cost uniformly, the video unsupervised domain adaptation (VUDA) is introduced to adapt video models from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain by alleviating video domain shift, improving the generalizability and portability of video models. This paper surveys recent progress in VUDA with deep learning. We begin with the motivation of VUDA, followed by its definition, and recent progress of methods for both closed-set VUDA and VUDA under different scenarios, and current benchmark datasets for VUDA research. Eventually, future directions are provided to promote further VUDA research. The repository of this survey is provided at https://github.com/xuyu0010/awesome-video-domain-adaptation."
2211.10526,Castling-ViT: Compressing Self-Attention via Switching Towards   Linear-Angular Attention at Vision Transformer Inference,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance but still require a high computation cost as compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one reason is that ViTs' attention measures global similarities and thus has a quadratic complexity with the number of input tokens. Existing efficient ViTs adopt local attention (e.g., Swin) or linear attention (e.g., Performer), which sacrifice ViTs' capabilities of capturing either global or local context. In this work, we ask an important research question: Can ViTs learn both global and local context while being more efficient during inference? To this end, we propose a framework called Castling-ViT, which trains ViTs using both linear-angular attention and masked softmax-based quadratic attention, but then switches to having only linear angular attention during ViT inference. Our Castling-ViT leverages angular kernels to measure the similarities between queries and keys via spectral angles. And we further simplify it with two techniques: (1) a novel linear-angular attention mechanism: we decompose the angular kernels into linear terms and high-order residuals, and only keep the linear terms; and (2) we adopt two parameterized modules to approximate high-order residuals: a depthwise convolution and an auxiliary masked softmax attention to help learn both global and local information, where the masks for softmax attention are regularized to gradually become zeros and thus incur no overhead during ViT inference. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of the proposed Castling-ViT, e.g., achieving up to a 1.8% higher accuracy or 40% MACs reduction on ImageNet classification and 1.2 higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to ViTs with vanilla softmax-based attentions."
2211.10580,Normal Transformer: Extracting Surface Geometry from LiDAR Points   Enhanced by Visual Semantics,"High-quality surface normal can help improve geometry estimation in problems faced by autonomous vehicles, such as collision avoidance and occlusion inference. While a considerable volume of literature focuses on densely scanned indoor scenarios, normal estimation during autonomous driving remains an intricate problem due to the sparse, non-uniform, and noisy nature of real-world LiDAR scans. In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal technique that leverages 3D point clouds and 2D colour images obtained from LiDAR and camera sensors for surface normal estimation. We present the Hybrid Geometric Transformer (HGT), a novel transformer-based neural network architecture that proficiently fuses visual semantic and 3D geometric information. Furthermore, we developed an effective learning strategy for the multi-modal data. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our information fusion approach compared to existing methods. It has also been verified that the proposed model can learn from a simulated 3D environment that mimics a traffic scene. The learned geometric knowledge is transferable and can be applied to real-world 3D scenes in the KITTI dataset. Further tasks built upon the estimated normal vectors in the KITTI dataset show that the proposed estimator has an advantage over existing methods."
2211.10630,Explainable fetal ultrasound quality assessment with progressive concept   bottleneck models,"The quality of fetal ultrasound screening scans directly influences the precision of biometric measurements. However, acquiring high-quality scans is labor-intensive and highly relies on the operator's skills. Considering the low contrastiveness and imaging artifacts that widely exist in ultrasound, even a dedicated deep-learning model can be vulnerable to learning from confounding information in the image. In this paper, we propose a holistic and explainable method for fetal ultrasound quality assessment, where we design a hierarchical concept bottleneck model by introducing human-readable ``concepts"" into the task and imitating the sequential expert decision-making process. This hierarchical information flow forces the model to learn concepts from semantically meaningful areas: The model first passes through a layer of visual, segmentation-based concepts, and next a second layer of property concepts directly associated with the decision-making task. We consider the quality assessment to be in a more challenging but more realistic setting, with fine-grained image recognition. Experiments show that our model outperforms equivalent concept-free models on an in-house dataset, and shows better generalizability on two public benchmarks, one from Spain and one from Africa, without any fine-tuning."
2211.10636,EVEREST: Efficient Masked Video Autoencoder by Removing Redundant   Spatiotemporal Tokens,"Masked Video Autoencoder (MVA) approaches have demonstrated their potential by significantly outperforming previous video representation learning methods. However, they waste an excessive amount of computations and memory in predicting uninformative tokens/frames due to random masking strategies. (e.g., over 16 nodes with 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs). To resolve this issue, we exploit the unequal information density among the patches in videos and propose EVEREST, a surprisingly efficient MVA approach for video representation learning that finds tokens containing rich motion features and discards uninformative ones during both pre-training and fine-tuning. We further present an information-intensive frame selection strategy that allows the model to focus on informative and causal frames with minimal redundancy. Our method significantly reduces the computation and memory requirements of MVA, enabling the pre-training and fine-tuning on a single machine with 8 GPUs while achieving comparable performance to computation- and memory-heavy baselines on multiple benchmarks and the uncurated Ego4D dataset. We hope that our work contributes to reducing the barrier to further research on video understanding."
2211.10858,An interpretable imbalanced semi-supervised deep learning framework for   improving differential diagnosis of skin diseases,"Dermatological diseases are among the most common disorders worldwide. This paper presents the first study of the interpretability and imbalanced semi-supervised learning of the multiclass intelligent skin diagnosis framework (ISDL) using 58,457 skin images with 10,857 unlabeled samples. Pseudo-labelled samples from minority classes have a higher probability at each iteration of class-rebalancing self-training, thereby promoting the utilization of unlabeled samples to solve the class imbalance problem. Our ISDL achieved a promising performance with an accuracy of 0.979, sensitivity of 0.975, specificity of 0.973, macro-F1 score of 0.974 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.999 for multi-label skin disease classification. The Shapley Additive explanation (SHAP) method is combined with our ISDL to explain how the deep learning model makes predictions. This finding is consistent with the clinical diagnosis. We also proposed a sampling distribution optimisation strategy to select pseudo-labelled samples in a more effective manner using ISDLplus. Furthermore, it has the potential to relieve the pressure placed on professional doctors, as well as help with practical issues associated with a shortage of such doctors in rural areas."
2211.10867,Rethinking the Paradigm of Content Constraints in Unpaired   Image-to-Image Translation,"In an unpaired setting, lacking sufficient content constraints for image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks, GAN-based approaches are usually prone to model collapse. Current solutions can be divided into two categories, reconstruction-based and Siamese network-based. The former requires that the transformed or transforming image can be perfectly converted back to the original image, which is sometimes too strict and limits the generative performance. The latter involves feeding the original and generated images into a feature extractor and then matching their outputs. This is not efficient enough, and a universal feature extractor is not easily available. In this paper, we propose EnCo, a simple but efficient way to maintain the content by constraining the representational similarity in the latent space of patch-level features from the same stage of the \textbf{En}coder and de\textbf{Co}der of the generator. For the similarity function, we use a simple MSE loss instead of contrastive loss, which is currently widely used in I2I tasks. Benefits from the design, EnCo training is extremely efficient, while the features from the encoder produce a more positive effect on the decoding, leading to more satisfying generations. In addition, we rethink the role played by discriminators in sampling patches and propose a discriminative attention-guided (DAG) patch sampling strategy to replace random sampling. DAG is parameter-free and only requires negligible computational overhead, while significantly improving the performance of the model. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of EnCo, and we achieve multiple state-of-the-art compared to previous methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/EnCo-pytorch."
2211.10881,Deepfake Detection: A Comprehensive Survey from the Reliability   Perspective,"The mushroomed Deepfake synthetic materials circulated on the internet have raised a profound social impact on politicians, celebrities, and individuals worldwide. In this survey, we provide a thorough review of the existing Deepfake detection studies from the reliability perspective. We identify three reliability-oriented research challenges in the current Deepfake detection domain: transferability, interpretability, and robustness. Moreover, while solutions have been frequently addressed regarding the three challenges, the general reliability of a detection model has been barely considered, leading to the lack of reliable evidence in real-life usages and even for prosecutions on Deepfake-related cases in court. We, therefore, introduce a model reliability study metric using statistical random sampling knowledge and the publicly available benchmark datasets to review the reliability of the existing detection models on arbitrary Deepfake candidate suspects. Case studies are further executed to justify the real-life Deepfake cases including different groups of victims with the help of the reliably qualified detection models as reviewed in this survey. Reviews and experiments on the existing approaches provide informative discussions and future research directions for Deepfake detection."
2211.10882,Multi-head Ensemble of Smoothed Classifiers for Certified Robustness,"Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a promising technique for certified robustness, and recently in RS the ensemble of multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has shown state-of-the-art performances due to its variance reduction effect over Gaussian noises. However, such an ensemble brings heavy computation burdens in both training and certification, and yet under-exploits individual DNNs and their mutual effects, as the communication between these classifiers is commonly ignored in optimization. In this work, we consider a novel ensemble-based training way for a single DNN with multiple augmented heads, named as SmOothed Multi-head Ensemble (SOME). In SOME, similar to the pursuit of variance reduction via ensemble, an ensemble of multiple heads imposed with a cosine constraint inside a single DNN is employed with much cheaper training and certification computation overloads in RS. In such network structure, an associated training strategy is designed by introducing a circular communication flow among those augmented heads. That is, each head teaches its neighbor with the self-paced learning strategy using smoothed losses, which are specifically designed in relation to certified robustness. The deployed multi-head structure and the circular-teaching scheme in SOME jointly contribute to the diversities among multiple heads and benefit their ensemble, leading to a competitively stronger certifiably-robust RS-based defense than ensembling multiple DNNs (effectiveness) at the cost of much less computational expenses (efficiency), verified by extensive experiments and discussions."
2211.10938,AI-KD: Adversarial learning and Implicit regularization for   self-Knowledge Distillation,"We present a novel adversarial penalized self-knowledge distillation method, named adversarial learning and implicit regularization for self-knowledge distillation (AI-KD), which regularizes the training procedure by adversarial learning and implicit distillations. Our model not only distills the deterministic and progressive knowledge which are from the pre-trained and previous epoch predictive probabilities but also transfers the knowledge of the deterministic predictive distributions using adversarial learning. The motivation is that the self-knowledge distillation methods regularize the predictive probabilities with soft targets, but the exact distributions may be hard to predict. Our method deploys a discriminator to distinguish the distributions between the pre-trained and student models while the student model is trained to fool the discriminator in the trained procedure. Thus, the student model not only can learn the pre-trained model's predictive probabilities but also align the distributions between the pre-trained and student models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with network architectures on multiple datasets and show the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods."
2211.10960,CoCoNet: Coupled Contrastive Learning Network with Multi-level Feature   Ensemble for Multi-modality Image Fusion,"Infrared and visible image fusion targets to provide an informative image by combining complementary information from different sensors. Existing learning-based fusion approaches attempt to construct various loss functions to preserve complementary features, while neglecting to discover the inter-relationship between the two modalities, leading to redundant or even invalid information on the fusion results. Moreover, most methods focus on strengthening the network with an increase in depth while neglecting the importance of feature transmission, causing vital information degeneration. To alleviate these issues, we propose a coupled contrastive learning network, dubbed CoCoNet, to realize infrared and visible image fusion in an end-to-end manner. Concretely, to simultaneously retain typical features from both modalities and to avoid artifacts emerging on the fused result, we develop a coupled contrastive constraint in our loss function. In a fused image, its foreground target / background detail part is pulled close to the infrared / visible source and pushed far away from the visible / infrared source in the representation space. We further exploit image characteristics to provide data-sensitive weights, allowing our loss function to build a more reliable relationship with source images. A multi-level attention module is established to learn rich hierarchical feature representation and to comprehensively transfer features in the fusion process. We also apply the proposed CoCoNet on medical image fusion of different types, e.g., magnetic resonance image, positron emission tomography image, and single photon emission computed tomography image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under both subjective and objective evaluation, especially in preserving prominent targets and recovering vital textural details."
2211.11010,"Revisiting Color-Event based Tracking: A Unified Network, Dataset, and   Metric","Combining the Color and Event cameras (also called Dynamic Vision Sensors, DVS) for robust object tracking is a newly emerging research topic in recent years. Existing color-event tracking framework usually contains multiple scattered modules which may lead to low efficiency and high computational complexity, including feature extraction, fusion, matching, interactive learning, etc. In this paper, we propose a single-stage backbone network for Color-Event Unified Tracking (CEUTrack), which achieves the above functions simultaneously. Given the event points and RGB frames, we first transform the points into voxels and crop the template and search regions for both modalities, respectively. Then, these regions are projected into tokens and parallelly fed into the unified Transformer backbone network. The output features will be fed into a tracking head for target object localization. Our proposed CEUTrack is simple, effective, and efficient, which achieves over 75 FPS and new SOTA performance. To better validate the effectiveness of our model and address the data deficiency of this task, we also propose a generic and large-scale benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT, which contains 90 categories and 1354 video sequences. Additionally, a new evaluation metric named BOC is proposed in our evaluation toolkit to evaluate the prominence with respect to the baseline methods. We hope the newly proposed method, dataset, and evaluation metric provide a better platform for color-event-based tracking.

2211.11086,An Embarrassingly Simple Baseline for Imbalanced Semi-Supervised   Learning,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in leveraging unlabeled data to improve model performance. While standard SSL assumes uniform data distribution, we consider a more realistic and challenging setting called imbalanced SSL, where imbalanced class distributions occur in both labeled and unlabeled data. Although there are existing endeavors to tackle this challenge, their performance degenerates when facing severe imbalance since they can not reduce the class imbalance sufficiently and effectively. In this paper, we study a simple yet overlooked baseline -- SimiS -- which tackles data imbalance by simply supplementing labeled data with pseudo-labels, according to the difference in class distribution from the most frequent class. Such a simple baseline turns out to be highly effective in reducing class imbalance. It outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, e.g., 12.8%, 13.6%, and 16.7% over previous SOTA on CIFAR100-LT, FOOD101-LT, and ImageNet127 respectively. The reduced imbalance results in faster convergence and better pseudo-label accuracy of SimiS. The simplicity of our method also makes it possible to be combined with other re-balancing techniques to improve the performance further. Moreover, our method shows great robustness to a wide range of data distributions, which holds enormous potential in practice. Code will be publicly available."
2211.11133,Enhancing Accuracy and Robustness of Steering Angle Prediction with   Attention Mechanism,"In this paper, our focus is on enhancing steering angle prediction for autonomous driving tasks. We initiate our exploration by investigating two veins of widely adopted deep neural architectures, namely ResNets and InceptionNets. Within both families, we systematically evaluate various model sizes to understand their impact on performance. Notably, our key contribution lies in the incorporation of an attention mechanism to augment steering angle prediction accuracy and robustness. By introducing attention, our models gain the ability to selectively focus on crucial regions within the input data, leading to improved predictive outcomes. Our findings showcase that our attention-enhanced models not only achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of steering angle Mean Squared Error (MSE) but also exhibit enhanced adversarial robustness, addressing critical concerns in real-world deployment. For example, in our experiments on the Kaggle SAP and our created publicly available datasets, attention can lead to over 6% error reduction in steering angle prediction and boost model robustness by up to 56.09%."
2211.11137,Long Range Constraints for Neural Texture Synthesis Using Sliced   Wasserstein Loss,"In the past decade, exemplar-based texture synthesis algorithms have seen strong gains in performance by matching statistics of deep convolutional neural networks. However, these algorithms require regularization terms or user-added spatial tags to capture long range constraints in images. Having access to a user-added spatial tag for all situations is not always feasible, and regularization terms can be difficult to tune. Thus, we propose a new set of statistics for texture synthesis based on Sliced Wasserstein Loss, create a multi-scale method to synthesize textures without a user-added spatial tag, study the ability of our proposed method to capture long range constraints, and compare our results to other optimization-based, single texture synthesis algorithms."
2211.11167,Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling,"Vision transformer has achieved impressive performance for many vision tasks. However, it may suffer from high redundancy in capturing local features for shallow layers. Local self-attention or early-stage convolutions are thus utilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A challenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context modeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of image primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into vision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful tessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in self-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose a simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the first samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning, the second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back to the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into multiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention, leading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies. Based on STA, we develop a hierarchical vision transformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate its strong performance on various vision tasks. In particular, without any extra training data or label, it achieves 86.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with less than 100M parameters. It also achieves 53.9 box AP and 46.8 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 51.9 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task. Code is released at https://github.com/hhb072/STViT."
2211.11174,Unveiling the Tapestry: the Interplay of Generalization and Forgetting   in Continual Learning,"In AI, generalization refers to a model's ability to perform well on out-of-distribution data related to the given task, beyond the data it was trained on. For an AI agent to excel, it must also possess the continual learning capability, whereby an agent incrementally learns to perform a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge to solve the old tasks. Intuitively, generalization within a task allows the model to learn underlying features that can readily be applied to novel tasks, facilitating quicker learning and enhanced performance in subsequent tasks within a continual learning framework. Conversely, continual learning methods often include mechanisms to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, ensuring that knowledge from earlier tasks is retained. This preservation of knowledge over tasks plays a role in enhancing generalization for the ongoing task at hand. Despite the intuitive appeal of the interplay of both abilities, existing literature on continual learning and generalization has proceeded separately. In the preliminary effort to promote studies that bridge both fields, we first present empirical evidence showing that each of these fields has a mutually positive effect on the other. Next, building upon this finding, we introduce a simple and effective technique known as Shape-Texture Consistency Regularization (STCR), which caters to continual learning. STCR learns both shape and texture representations for each task, consequently enhancing generalization and thereby mitigating forgetting. Remarkably, extensive experiments validate that our STCR, can be seamlessly integrated with existing continual learning methods, including replay-free approaches. Its performance surpasses these continual learning methods in isolation or when combined with established generalization techniques by a large margin."
2211.11188,Simultaneous Multiple Object Detection and Pose Estimation using 3D   Model Infusion with Monocular Vision,"Multiple object detection and pose estimation are vital computer vision tasks. The latter relates to the former as a downstream problem in applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, due to the high complexity of both tasks, existing methods generally treat them independently, which is sub-optimal. We propose simultaneous neural modeling of both using monocular vision and 3D model infusion. Our Simultaneous Multiple Object detection and Pose Estimation network (SMOPE-Net) is an end-to-end trainable multitasking network with a composite loss that also provides the advantages of anchor-free detections for efficient downstream pose estimation. To enable the annotation of training data for our learning objective, we develop a Twin-Space object labeling method and demonstrate its correctness analytically and empirically. Using the labeling method, we provide the KITTI-6DoF dataset with $\sim7.5$K annotated frames. Extensive experiments on KITTI-6DoF and the popular LineMod datasets show a consistent performance gain with SMOPE-Net over existing pose estimation methods. Here are links to our proposed SMOPE-Net, KITTI-6DoF dataset, and LabelImg3D labeling tool."
2211.11236,Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks with Global Momentum   Initialization,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the benign inputs. Simultaneously, adversarial examples exhibit transferability across models, enabling practical black-box attacks. However, existing methods are still incapable of achieving the desired transfer attack performance. In this work, focusing on gradient optimization and consistency, we analyse the gradient elimination phenomenon as well as the local momentum optimum dilemma. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Global Momentum Initialization (GI), providing global momentum knowledge to mitigate gradient elimination. Specifically, we perform gradient pre-convergence before the attack and a global search during this stage. GI seamlessly integrates with existing transfer methods, significantly improving the success rate of transfer attacks by an average of 6.4% under various advanced defense mechanisms compared to the state-of-the-art method. Ultimately, GI demonstrates strong transferability in both image and video attack domains. Particularly, when attacking advanced defense methods in the image domain, it achieves an average attack success rate of 95.4%. The code is available at $\href{https://github.com/Omenzychen/Global-Momentum-Initialization}{https://github.com/Omenzychen/Global-Momentum-Initialization}$."
2211.11257,Computational Imaging for Machine Perception: Transferring Semantic   Segmentation beyond Aberrations,"Semantic scene understanding with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS) in mobile and wearable applications remains a challenge due to the corrupted imaging quality induced by optical aberrations. However, previous works only focus on improving the subjective imaging quality through the Computational Imaging (CI) technique, ignoring the feasibility of advancing semantic segmentation. In this paper, we pioneer the investigation of Semantic Segmentation under Optical Aberrations (SSOA) with MOS. To benchmark SSOA, we construct Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of aberrations. We look into SSOA via an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world scenarios. Further, we propose Computational Imaging Assisted Domain Adaptation (CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of classical segmenters against aberrations. In addition, extensive evaluations of possible solutions to SSOA reveal that CIADA achieves superior performance under all aberration distributions, bridging the gap between computational imaging and downstream applications for MOS. The project page is at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/CIADA."
2211.11293,Beyond the Field-of-View: Enhancing Scene Visibility and Perception with   Clip-Recurrent Transformer,"Vision sensors are widely applied in vehicles, robots, and roadside infrastructure. However, due to limitations in hardware cost and system size, camera Field-of-View (FoV) is often restricted and may not provide sufficient coverage. Nevertheless, from a spatiotemporal perspective, it is possible to obtain information beyond the camera's physical FoV from past video streams. In this paper, we propose the concept of online video inpainting for autonomous vehicles to expand the field of view, thereby enhancing scene visibility, perception, and system safety. To achieve this, we introduce the FlowLens architecture, which explicitly employs optical flow and implicitly incorporates a novel clip-recurrent transformer for feature propagation. FlowLens offers two key features: 1) FlowLens includes a newly designed Clip-Recurrent Hub with 3D-Decoupled Cross Attention (DDCA) to progressively process global information accumulated over time. 2) It integrates a multi-branch Mix Fusion Feed Forward Network (MixF3N) to enhance the precise spatial flow of local features. To facilitate training and evaluation, we derive the KITTI360 dataset with various FoV mask, which covers both outer- and inner FoV expansion scenarios. We also conduct both quantitative assessments and qualitative comparisons of beyond-FoV semantics and beyond-FoV object detection across different models. We illustrate that employing FlowLens to reconstruct unseen scenes even enhances perception within the field of view by providing reliable semantic context. Extensive experiments and user studies involving offline and online video inpainting, as well as beyond-FoV perception tasks, demonstrate that FlowLens achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and dataset are made publicly available at https://github.com/MasterHow/FlowLens."
2211.11312,Understanding the Vulnerability of Skeleton-based Human Activity   Recognition via Black-box Attack,"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been employed in a wide range of applications, e.g. self-driving cars, where safety and lives are at stake. Recently, the robustness of skeleton-based HAR methods have been questioned due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, the proposed attacks require the full-knowledge of the attacked classifier, which is overly restrictive. In this paper, we show such threats indeed exist, even when the attacker only has access to the input/output of the model. To this end, we propose the very first black-box adversarial attack approach in skeleton-based HAR called BASAR. BASAR explores the interplay between the classification boundary and the natural motion manifold. To our best knowledge, this is the first time data manifold is introduced in adversarial attacks on time series. Via BASAR, we find on-manifold adversarial samples are extremely deceitful and rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation, we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across classifiers, datasets, and attack modes. By attack, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of the model vulnerability and provides insights on possible improvements. Finally, to mitigate the newly identified threat, we propose a new adversarial training approach by leveraging the sophisticated distributions of on/off-manifold adversarial samples, called mixed manifold-based adversarial training (MMAT). MMAT can successfully help defend against adversarial attacks without compromising classification accuracy."
2211.11337,DreamArtist++: Controllable One-Shot Text-to-Image Generation via   Positive-Negative Adapter,"State-of-the-arts text-to-image generation models such as Imagen and Stable Diffusion Model have succeed remarkable progresses in synthesizing high-quality, feature-rich images with high resolution guided by human text prompts. Since certain characteristics of image content \emph{e.g.}, very specific object entities or styles, are very hard to be accurately described by text, some example-based image generation approaches have been proposed, \emph{i.e.} generating new concepts based on absorbing the salient features of a few input references. Despite of acknowledged successes, these methods have struggled on accurately capturing the reference examples' characteristics while keeping diverse and high-quality image generation, particularly in the one-shot scenario (\emph{i.e.} given only one reference). To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet effective framework, namely DreamArtist, which adopts a novel positive-negative prompt-tuning learning strategy on the pre-trained diffusion model, and it has shown to well handle the trade-off between the accurate controllability and fidelity of image generation with only one reference example. Specifically, our proposed framework incorporates both positive and negative embeddings or adapters and optimizes them in a joint manner. The positive part aggressively captures the salient characteristics of the reference image to drive diversified generation and the negative part rectifies inadequacies from the positive part. We have conducted extensive experiments and evaluated the proposed method from image similarity (fidelity) and diversity, generation controllability, and style cloning. And our DreamArtist has achieved a superior generation performance over existing methods. Besides, our additional evaluation on extended tasks, including concept compositions and prompt-guided image editing, demonstrates its effectiveness for more applications."
2211.11424,Modeling Hierarchical Structural Distance for Unsupervised Domain   Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to estimate a transferable model for unlabeled target domains by exploiting labeled source data. Optimal Transport (OT) based methods have recently been proven to be a promising solution for UDA with a solid theoretical foundation and competitive performance. However, most of these methods solely focus on domain-level OT alignment by leveraging the geometry of domains for domain-invariant features based on the global embeddings of images. However, global representations of images may destroy image structure, leading to the loss of local details that offer category-discriminative information. This study proposes an end-to-end Deep Hierarchical Optimal Transport method (DeepHOT), which aims to learn both domain-invariant and category-discriminative representations by mining hierarchical structural relations among domains. The main idea is to incorporate a domain-level OT and image-level OT into a unified OT framework, hierarchical optimal transport, to model the underlying geometry in both domain space and image space. In DeepHOT framework, an image-level OT serves as the ground distance metric for the domain-level OT, leading to the hierarchical structural distance. Compared with the ground distance of the conventional domain-level OT, the image-level OT captures structural associations among local regions of images that are beneficial to classification. In this way, DeepHOT, a unified OT framework, not only aligns domains by domain-level OT, but also enhances the discriminative power through image-level OT. Moreover, to overcome the limitation of high computational complexity, we propose a robust and efficient implementation of DeepHOT by approximating origin OT with sliced Wasserstein distance in image-level OT and accomplishing the mini-batch unbalanced domain-level OT."
2211.11435,ZigZag: Universal Sampling-free Uncertainty Estimation Through Two-Step   Inference,"Whereas the ability of deep networks to produce useful predictions has been amply demonstrated, estimating the reliability of these predictions remains challenging. Sampling approaches such as MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles have emerged as the most popular ones for this purpose. Unfortunately, they require many forward passes at inference time, which slows them down. Sampling-free approaches can be faster but suffer from other drawbacks, such as lower reliability of uncertainty estimates, difficulty of use, and limited applicability to different types of tasks and data.   In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach that is generic and easy to deploy, while producing reliable uncertainty estimates on par with state-of-the-art methods at a significantly lower computational cost. It is predicated on training the network to produce the same output with and without additional information about it. At inference time, when no prior information is given, we use the network's own prediction as the additional information. We then take the distance between the predictions with and without prior information as our uncertainty measure.   We demonstrate our approach on several classification and regression tasks. We show that it delivers results on par with those of Ensembles but at a much lower computational cost."
2211.11571,SLLEN: Semantic-aware Low-light Image Enhancement Network,"How to effectively explore semantic feature is vital for low-light image enhancement (LLE). Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SSLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives."
2211.11612,Plug and Play Active Learning for Object Detection,"Annotating datasets for object detection is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. To minimize this burden, active learning (AL) techniques are employed to select the most informative samples for annotation within a constrained ""annotation budget"". Traditional AL strategies typically rely on model uncertainty or sample diversity for query sampling, while more advanced methods have focused on developing AL-specific object detector architectures to enhance performance. However, these specialized approaches are not readily adaptable to different object detectors due to the significant engineering effort required for integration. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL), a simple and effective AL strategy for object detection. PPAL is a two-stage method comprising uncertainty-based and diversity-based sampling phases. In the first stage, our Difficulty Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling leverage a category-wise difficulty coefficient that combines both classification and localisation difficulties to re-weight instance uncertainties, from which we sample a candidate pool for the subsequent diversity-based sampling. In the second stage, we propose Category Conditioned Matching Similarity to better compute the similarities of multi-instance images as ensembles of their instance similarities, which is used by the k-Means++ algorithm to sample the final AL queries. PPAL makes no change to model architectures or detector training pipelines; hence it can be easily generalized to different object detectors. We benchmark PPAL on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets using different detector architectures and show that our method outperforms prior work by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/ChenhongyiYang/PPAL"
2211.11825,Multi-Directional Subspace Editing in Style-Space,"This paper describes a new technique for finding disentangled semantic directions in the latent space of StyleGAN. Our method identifies meaningful orthogonal subspaces that allow editing of one human face attribute, while minimizing undesired changes in other attributes. Our model is capable of editing a single attribute in multiple directions, resulting in a range of possible generated images. We compare our scheme with three state-of-the-art models and show that our method outperforms them in terms of face editing and disentanglement capabilities. Additionally, we suggest quantitative measures for evaluating attribute separation and disentanglement, and exhibit the superiority of our model with respect to those measures."
2211.12036,Dual Prototype Attention for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,"Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect and segment the most salient object in videos. The primary techniques used in unsupervised VOS are 1) the collaboration of appearance and motion information; and 2) temporal fusion between different frames. This paper proposes two novel prototype-based attention mechanisms, inter-modality attention (IMA) and inter-frame attention (IFA), to incorporate these techniques via dense propagation across different modalities and frames. IMA densely integrates context information from different modalities based on a mutual refinement. IFA injects global context of a video to the query frame, enabling a full utilization of useful properties from multiple frames. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all existing methods by a substantial margin. The proposed two components are also thoroughly validated via ablative study."
2211.12123,GAN Inversion for Image Editing via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Existing GAN inversion methods work brilliantly in reconstructing high-quality (HQ) images while struggling with more common low-quality (LQ) inputs in practical application. To address this issue, we propose Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the inversion process, namely UDA-inversion, for effective inversion and editing of both HQ and LQ images. Regarding unpaired HQ images as the source domain and LQ images as the unlabeled target domain, we introduce a theoretical guarantee: loss value in the target domain is upper-bounded by loss in the source domain and a novel discrepancy function measuring the difference between two domains. Following that, we can only minimize this upper bound to obtain accurate latent codes for HQ and LQ images. Thus, constructive representations of HQ images can be spontaneously learned and transformed into LQ images without supervision. UDA-Inversion achieves a better PSNR of 22.14 on FFHQ dataset and performs comparably to supervised methods."
2211.12222,Event Transformer+. A multi-purpose solution for efficient event data   processing,"Event cameras record sparse illumination changes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Thanks to their sparse recording and low consumption, they are increasingly used in applications such as AR/VR and autonomous driving. Current topperforming methods often ignore specific event-data properties, leading to the development of generic but computationally expensive algorithms, while event-aware methods do not perform as well. We propose Event Transformer+, that improves our seminal work EvT with a refined patch-based event representation and a more robust backbone to achieve more accurate results, while still benefiting from event-data sparsity to increase its efficiency. Additionally, we show how our system can work with different data modalities and propose specific output heads, for event-stream classification (i.e. action recognition) and per-pixel predictions (dense depth estimation). Evaluation results show better performance to the state-of-the-art while requiring minimal computation resources, both on GPU and CPU."
2211.12343,Diffusion Model Based Posterior Sampling for Noisy Linear Inverse   Problems,"With the rapid development of diffusion models and flow-based generative models, there has been a surge of interests in solving noisy linear inverse problems, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, colorization, etc, with generative models. However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score. For both diffusion and flow-based models, extensive experiments are conducted on various noisy linear inverse problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, and colorization. In all these tasks, our method (namely DMPS) demonstrates highly competitive or even better reconstruction performances while being significantly faster than all the baseline methods."
2211.12353,U-Flow: A U-shaped Normalizing Flow for Anomaly Detection with   Unsupervised Threshold,"In this work we propose a one-class self-supervised method for anomaly segmentation in images that benefits both from a modern machine learning approach and a more classic statistical detection theory. The method consists of four phases. First, features are extracted using a multi-scale image Transformer architecture. Then, these features are fed into a U-shaped Normalizing Flow (NF) that lays the theoretical foundations for the subsequent phases. The third phase computes a pixel-level anomaly map from the NF embedding, and the last phase performs a segmentation based on the a contrario framework. This multiple hypothesis testing strategy permits the derivation of robust unsupervised detection thresholds, which are crucial in real-world applications where an operational point is needed. The segmentation results are evaluated using the Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, and for assessing the generated anomaly maps we report the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), as well as the Area Under the Per-Region-Overlap curve (AUPRO). Extensive experimentation in various datasets shows that the proposed approach produces state-of-the-art results for all metrics and all datasets, ranking first in most MVTec-AD categories, with a mean pixel-level AUROC of 98.74%. Code and trained models are available at https:// github.com/mtailanian/uflow."
2211.12371,Gait Recognition in Large-scale Free Environment via Single LiDAR,"Human gait recognition is crucial in multimedia, enabling identification through walking patterns without direct interaction, enhancing the integration across various media forms in real-world applications like smart homes, healthcare and non-intrusive security. LiDAR's ability to capture depth makes it pivotal for robotic perception and holds promise for real-world gait recognition. In this paper, based on a single LiDAR, we present the Hierarchical Multi-representation Feature Interaction Network (HMRNet) for robust gait recognition. Prevailing LiDAR-based gait datasets primarily derive from controlled settings with predefined trajectory, remaining a gap with real-world scenarios. To facilitate LiDAR-based gait recognition research, we introduce FreeGait, a comprehensive gait dataset from large-scale, unconstrained settings, enriched with multi-modal and varied 2D/3D data. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on prior dataset (SUSTech1K) and on FreeGait."
2211.12492,"VideoMap: Supporting Video Editing Exploration, Brainstorming, and   Prototyping in the Latent Space","Video editing is a creative and complex endeavor and we believe that there is potential for reimagining a new video editing interface to better support the creative and exploratory nature of video editing. We take inspiration from latent space exploration tools that help users find patterns and connections within complex datasets. We present VideoMap, a proof-of-concept video editing interface that operates on video frames projected onto a latent space. We support intuitive navigation through map-inspired navigational elements and facilitate transitioning between different latent spaces through swappable lenses. We built three VideoMap components to support editors in three common video tasks. In a user study with both professionals and non-professionals, editors found that VideoMap helps reduce grunt work, offers a user-friendly experience, provides an inspirational way of editing, and effectively supports the exploratory nature of video editing. We further demonstrate the versatility of VideoMap by implementing three extended applications. For interactive examples, we invite you to visit our project page: https://humanvideointeraction.github.io/videomap."
2211.12493,Videogenic: Identifying Highlight Moments in Videos with Professional   Photographs as a Prior,"This paper investigates the challenge of extracting highlight moments from videos. To perform this task, we need to understand what constitutes a highlight for arbitrary video domains while at the same time being able to scale across different domains. Our key insight is that photographs taken by photographers tend to capture the most remarkable or photogenic moments of an activity. Drawing on this insight, we present Videogenic, a technique capable of creating domain-specific highlight videos for a diverse range of domains. In a human evaluation study (N=50), we show that a high-quality photograph collection combined with CLIP-based retrieval (which uses a neural network with semantic knowledge of images) can serve as an excellent prior for finding video highlights. In a within-subjects expert study (N=12), we demonstrate the usefulness of Videogenic in helping video editors create highlight videos with lighter workload, shorter task completion time, and better usability."
2211.12702,Evaluating Feature Attribution Methods for Electrocardiogram,"The performance of cardiac arrhythmia detection with electrocardiograms(ECGs) has been considerably improved since the introduction of deep learning models. In practice, the high performance alone is not sufficient and a proper explanation is also required. Recently, researchers have started adopting feature attribution methods to address this requirement, but it has been unclear which of the methods are appropriate for ECG. In this work, we identify and customize three evaluation metrics for feature attribution methods based on the characteristics of ECG: localization score, pointing game, and degradation score. Using the three evaluation metrics, we evaluate and analyze eleven widely-used feature attribution methods. We find that some of the feature attribution methods are much more adequate for explaining ECG, where Grad-CAM outperforms the second-best method by a large margin."
2211.12735,Fast-iTPN: Integrally Pre-Trained Transformer Pyramid Network with Token   Migration,"We propose integrally pre-trained transformer pyramid network (iTPN), towards jointly optimizing the network backbone and the neck, so that transfer gap between representation models and downstream tasks is minimal. iTPN is born with two elaborated designs: 1) The first pre-trained feature pyramid upon vision transformer (ViT). 2) Multi-stage supervision to the feature pyramid using masked feature modeling (MFM). iTPN is updated to Fast-iTPN, reducing computational memory overhead and accelerating inference through two flexible designs. 1) Token migration: dropping redundant tokens of the backbone while replenishing them in the feature pyramid without attention operations. 2) Token gathering: reducing computation cost caused by global attention by introducing few gathering tokens. The base/large-level Fast-iTPN achieve 88.75%/89.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. With 1x training schedule using DINO, the base/large-level Fast-iTPN achieves 58.4%/58.8% box AP on COCO object detection, and a 57.5%/58.7% mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation using MaskDINO. Fast-iTPN can accelerate the inference procedure by up to 70%, with negligible performance loss, demonstrating the potential to be a powerful backbone for downstream vision tasks.

2211.12827,Video Instance Shadow Detection Under the Sun and Sky,"Instance shadow detection, crucial for applications such as photo editing and light direction estimation, has undergone significant advancements in predicting shadow instances, object instances, and their associations. The extension of this task to videos presents challenges in annotating diverse video data and addressing complexities arising from occlusion and temporary disappearances within associations. In response to these challenges, we introduce ViShadow, a semi-supervised video instance shadow detection framework that leverages both labeled image data and unlabeled video data for training. ViShadow features a two-stage training pipeline: the first stage, utilizing labeled image data, identifies shadow and object instances through contrastive learning for cross-frame pairing. The second stage employs unlabeled videos, incorporating an associated cycle consistency loss to enhance tracking ability. A retrieval mechanism is introduced to manage temporary disappearances, ensuring tracking continuity. The SOBA-VID dataset, comprising unlabeled training videos and labeled testing videos, along with the SOAP-VID metric, is introduced for the quantitative evaluation of VISD solutions. The effectiveness of ViShadow is further demonstrated through various video-level applications such as video inpainting, instance cloning, shadow editing, and text-instructed shadow-object manipulation."
2211.12829,Unsupervised 3D Keypoint Discovery with Multi-View Geometry,"Analyzing and training 3D body posture models depend heavily on the availability of joint labels that are commonly acquired through laborious manual annotation of body joints or via marker-based joint localization using carefully curated markers and capturing systems. However, such annotations are not always available, especially for people performing unusual activities. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that learns to discover 3D keypoints on human bodies from multiple-view images without any supervision or labels other than the constraints multiple-view geometry provides. To ensure that the discovered 3D keypoints are meaningful, they are re-projected to each view to estimate the person's mask that the model itself has initially estimated without supervision. Our approach discovers more interpretable and accurate 3D keypoints compared to other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets."
2211.12981,Holistic Visual-Textual Sentiment Analysis with Prior Models,"Visual-textual sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiment with the input of a pair of image and text, which poses a challenge in learning effective features for diverse input images. To address this, we propose a holistic method that achieves robust visual-textual sentiment analysis by exploiting a rich set of powerful pre-trained visual and textual prior models. The proposed method consists of four parts: (1) a visual-textual branch to learn features directly from data for sentiment analysis, (2) a visual expert branch with a set of pre-trained ""expert"" encoders to extract selected semantic visual features, (3) a CLIP branch to implicitly model visual-textual correspondence, and (4) a multimodal feature fusion network based on BERT to fuse multimodal features and make sentiment predictions. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method produces better visual-textual sentiment analysis performance than existing methods."
2211.13087,Can Machines Imitate Humans? Integrative Turing Tests for Vision and   Language Demonstrate a Narrowing Gap,"As AI algorithms increasingly participate in daily activities, it becomes critical to ascertain whether the agents we interact with are human or not. To address this question, we turn to the Turing test and systematically benchmark current AIs in their abilities to imitate humans in three language tasks (Image captioning, Word association, and Conversation) and three vision tasks (Object detection, Color estimation, and Attention prediction). The experiments involved 549 human agents plus 26 AI agents for dataset creation, and 1,126 human judges plus 10 AI judges, in 25,650 Turing-like tests. The results reveal that current AIs are not far from being able to impersonate humans in complex language and vision challenges. While human judges were often deceived, simple AI judges outperformed human judges in distinguishing human answers from AI answers. The results of imitation tests are only minimally correlated with standard performance metrics in AI. Thus, evaluating whether a machine can pass as a human constitutes an important independent test to evaluate AI algorithms. The curated, large-scale, Turing datasets introduced here and their evaluation metrics provide new benchmarks and insights to assess whether an agent is human or not and emphasize the relevance of rigorous, systematic, and quantitative imitation tests in these and other AI domains."
2211.13093,Autonomous Marker-less Rapid Aerial Grasping,"In a future with autonomous robots, visual and spatial perception is of utmost importance for robotic systems. Particularly for aerial robotics, there are many applications where utilizing visual perception is necessary for any real-world scenarios. Robotic aerial grasping using drones promises fast pick-and-place solutions with a large increase in mobility over other robotic solutions. Utilizing Mask R-CNN scene segmentation (detectron2), we propose a vision-based system for autonomous rapid aerial grasping which does not rely on markers for object localization and does not require the appearance of the object to be previously known. Combining segmented images with spatial information from a depth camera, we generate a dense point cloud of the detected objects and perform geometry-based grasp planning to determine grasping points on the objects. In real-world experiments on a dynamically grasping aerial platform, we show that our system can replicate the performance of a motion capture system for object localization up to 94.5 % of the baseline grasping success rate. With our results, we show the first use of geometry-based grasping techniques with a flying platform and aim to increase the autonomy of existing aerial manipulation platforms, bringing them further towards real-world applications in warehouses and similar environments."
2211.13174,Evolutionary Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,"Attribute-based Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has revolutionized the ability of models to recognize new classes not seen during training. However, with the advancement of large-scale models, the expectations have risen. Beyond merely achieving zero-shot generalization, there is a growing demand for universal models that can continually evolve in expert domains using unlabeled data. To address this, we introduce a scaled-down instantiation of this challenge: Evolutionary Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (EGZSL). This setting allows a low-performing zero-shot model to adapt to the test data stream and evolve online. We elaborate on three challenges of this special task, \ie, catastrophic forgetting, initial prediction bias, and evolutionary data class bias. Moreover, we propose targeted solutions for each challenge, resulting in a generic method capable of continuous evolution from a given initial IGZSL model. Experiments on three popular GZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model can learn from the test data stream while other baselines fail. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/cdb342/EGZSL}."
2211.13189,ASiT: Local-Global Audio Spectrogram vIsion Transformer for Event   Classification,"Transformers, which were originally developed for natural language processing, have recently generated significant interest in the computer vision and audio communities due to their flexibility in learning long-range relationships. Constrained by the data hungry nature of transformers and the limited amount of labelled data, most transformer-based models for audio tasks are finetuned from ImageNet pretrained models, despite the huge gap between the domain of natural images and audio. This has motivated the research in self-supervised pretraining of audio transformers, which reduces the dependency on large amounts of labeled data and focuses on extracting concise representations of audio spectrograms. In this paper, we propose \textbf{L}ocal-\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{A}udio \textbf{S}pectrogram v\textbf{I}sion \textbf{T}ransformer, namely ASiT, a novel self-supervised learning framework that captures local and global contextual information by employing group masked model learning and self-distillation. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks, including audio event classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies, including evaluations of different pretraining strategies. The proposed ASiT framework significantly boosts the performance on all tasks and sets a new state-of-the-art performance in five audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming recent methods, including the approaches that use additional datasets for pretraining."
2211.13220,TetraDiffusion: Tetrahedral Diffusion Models for 3D Shape Generation,"Probabilistic denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have set a new standard for 2D image generation. Extending DDMs for 3D content creation is an active field of research. Here, we propose TetraDiffusion, a diffusion model that operates on a tetrahedral partitioning of 3D space to enable efficient, high-resolution 3D shape generation. Our model introduces operators for convolution and transpose convolution that act directly on the tetrahedral partition, and seamlessly includes additional attributes such as color. Remarkably, TetraDiffusion enables rapid sampling of detailed 3D objects in nearly real-time with unprecedented resolution. It's also adaptable for generating 3D shapes conditioned on 2D images. Compared to existing 3D mesh diffusion techniques, our method is up to 200 times faster in inference speed, works on standard consumer hardware, and delivers superior results."
2211.13333,Learning to Rasterize Differentiably,"Differentiable rasterization changes the standard formulation of primitive rasterization -- by enabling gradient flow from a pixel to its underlying triangles -- using distribution functions in different stages of rendering, creating a ""soft"" version of the original rasterizer. However, choosing the optimal softening function that ensures the best performance and convergence to a desired goal requires trial and error. Previous work has analyzed and compared several combinations of softening. In this work, we take it a step further and, instead of making a combinatorial choice of softening operations, parameterize the continuous space of common softening operations. We study meta-learning tunable softness functions over a set of inverse rendering tasks (2D and 3D shape, pose and occlusion) so it generalizes to new and unseen differentiable rendering tasks with optimal softness."
2211.13398,CPPF++: Uncertainty-Aware Sim2Real Object Pose Estimation by Vote   Aggregation,"Object pose estimation constitutes a critical area within the domain of 3D vision. While contemporary state-of-the-art methods that leverage real-world pose annotations have demonstrated commendable performance, the procurement of such real training data incurs substantial costs. This paper focuses on a specific setting wherein only 3D CAD models are utilized as a priori knowledge, devoid of any background or clutter information. We introduce a novel method, CPPF++, designed for sim-to-real pose estimation. This method builds upon the foundational point-pair voting scheme of CPPF, reformulating it through a probabilistic view. To address the challenge posed by vote collision, we propose a novel approach that involves modeling the voting uncertainty by estimating the probabilistic distribution of each point pair within the canonical space. Furthermore, we augment the contextual information provided by each voting unit through the introduction of N-point tuples. To enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model, we incorporate several innovative modules, including noisy pair filtering, online alignment optimization, and a tuple feature ensemble. Alongside these methodological advancements, we introduce a new category-level pose estimation dataset, named DiversePose 300. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our method significantly surpasses previous sim-to-real approaches and achieves comparable or superior performance on novel datasets. Our code is available on https://github.com/qq456cvb/CPPF2."
2211.13613,Ham2Pose: Animating Sign Language Notation into Pose Sequences,"Translating spoken languages into Sign languages is necessary for open communication between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities. To achieve this goal, we propose the first method for animating a text written in HamNoSys, a lexical Sign language notation, into signed pose sequences. As HamNoSys is universal, our proposed method offers a generic solution invariant to the target Sign language. Our method gradually generates pose predictions using transformer encoders that create meaningful representations of the text and poses while considering their spatial and temporal information. We use weak supervision for the training process and show that our method succeeds in learning from partial and inaccurate data. Additionally, we offer a new distance measurement for pose sequences, normalized Dynamic Time Warping (nDTW), based on DTW over normalized keypoints trajectories, and validate its correctness using AUTSL, a large-scale Sign language dataset. We show that it measures the distance between pose sequences more accurately than existing measurements and use it to assess the quality of our generated pose sequences. Code for the data pre-processing, the model, and the distance measurement is publicly released for future research."
2211.13726,Lightweight Event-based Optical Flow Estimation via Iterative Deblurring,"Inspired by frame-based methods, state-of-the-art event-based optical flow networks rely on the explicit construction of correlation volumes, which are expensive to compute and store, rendering them unsuitable for robotic applications with limited compute and energy budget. Moreover, correlation volumes scale poorly with resolution, prohibiting them from estimating high-resolution flow. We observe that the spatiotemporally continuous traces of events provide a natural search direction for seeking pixel correspondences, obviating the need to rely on gradients of explicit correlation volumes as such search directions. We introduce IDNet (Iterative Deblurring Network), a lightweight yet high-performing event-based optical flow network directly estimating flow from event traces without using correlation volumes. We further propose two iterative update schemes: ""ID"" which iterates over the same batch of events, and ""TID"" which iterates over time with streaming events in an online fashion. Our top-performing ID model sets a new state of the art on DSEC benchmark. Meanwhile, the base ID model is competitive with prior arts while using 80% fewer parameters, consuming 20x less memory footprint and running 40% faster on the NVidia Jetson Xavier NX. Furthermore, the TID model is even more efficient offering an additional 5x faster inference speed and 8 ms ultra-low latency at the cost of only a 9% performance drop, making it the only model among current literature capable of real-time operation while maintaining decent performance."
2211.13756,Contrastive pretraining for semantic segmentation is robust to noisy   positive pairs,"Domain-specific variants of contrastive learning can construct positive pairs from two distinct in-domain images, while traditional methods just augment the same image twice. For example, we can form a positive pair from two satellite images showing the same location at different times. Ideally, this teaches the model to ignore changes caused by seasons, weather conditions or image acquisition artifacts. However, unlike in traditional contrastive methods, this can result in undesired positive pairs, since we form them without human supervision. For example, a positive pair might consist of one image before a disaster and one after. This could teach the model to ignore the differences between intact and damaged buildings, which might be what we want to detect in the downstream task. Similar to false negative pairs, this could impede model performance. Crucially, in this setting only parts of the images differ in relevant ways, while other parts remain similar. Surprisingly, we find that downstream semantic segmentation is either robust to such badly matched pairs or even benefits from them. The experiments are conducted on the remote sensing dataset xBD, and a synthetic segmentation dataset for which we have full control over the pairing conditions. As a result, practitioners can use these domain-specific contrastive methods without having to filter their positive pairs beforehand, or might even be encouraged to purposefully include such pairs in their pretraining dataset."
2211.13812,Improving Siamese Based Trackers with Light or No Training through   Multiple Templates and Temporal Network,"High computational power and significant time are usually needed to train a deep learning based tracker on large datasets. Depending on many factors, training might not always be an option. In this paper, we propose a framework with two ideas on Siamese-based trackers. (i) Extending number of templates in a way that removes the need to retrain the network and (ii) a lightweight temporal network with a novel architecture focusing on both local and global information that can be used independently from trackers. Most Siamese-based trackers only rely on the first frame as the ground truth for objects and struggle when the target's appearance changes significantly in subsequent frames in presence of similar distractors. Some trackers use multiple templates which mostly rely on constant thresholds to update, or they replace those templates that have low similarity scores only with more similar ones. Unlike previous works, we use adaptive thresholds that update the bag with similar templates as well as those templates which are slightly diverse. Adaptive thresholds also cause an overall improvement over constant ones. In addition, mixing feature maps obtained by each template in the last stage of networks removes the need to retrain trackers. Our proposed lightweight temporal network, CombiNet, learns the path history of different objects using only object coordinates and predicts target's potential location in the next frame. It is tracker independent and applying it on new trackers does not need further training. By implementing these ideas, trackers' performance improved on all datasets tested on, including LaSOT, LaSOT extension, TrackingNet, OTB100, OTB50, UAV123 and UAV20L. Experiments indicate the proposed framework works well with both convolutional and transformer-based trackers. The official python code for this paper will be publicly available upon publication."
2211.13854,ComCLIP: Training-Free Compositional Image and Text Matching,"Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated great zero-shot performance for matching images and text. However, it is still challenging to adapt vision-lanaguage pretrained models like CLIP to compositional image and text matching -- a more challenging image and text matching task requiring the model understanding of compositional word concepts and visual components. Towards better compositional generalization in zero-shot image and text matching, in this paper, we study the problem from a causal perspective: the erroneous semantics of individual entities are essentially confounders that cause the matching failure. Therefore, we propose a novel \textbf{\textit{training-free}} compositional CLIP model (ComCLIP). ComCLIP disentangles input images into subjects, objects, and action sub-images and composes CLIP's vision encoder and text encoder to perform evolving matching over compositional text embedding and sub-image embeddings. In this way, ComCLIP can mitigate spurious correlations introduced by the pretrained CLIP models and dynamically evaluate the importance of each component. Experiments on four compositional image-text matching datasets: SVO, ComVG, Winoground, and VL-checklist, and two general image-text retrieval datasets: Flick30K, and MSCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play method, which boosts the \textbf{\textit{zero-shot}} inference ability of CLIP, SLIP, and BLIP2 even without further training or fine-tuning. Our codes can be found at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/ComCLIP."
2211.13928,MUSTER: A Multi-scale Transformer-based Decoder for Semantic   Segmentation,"In recent works on semantic segmentation, there has been a significant focus on designing and integrating transformer-based encoders. However, less attention has been given to transformer-based decoders. We emphasize that the decoder stage is equally vital as the encoder in achieving superior segmentation performance. It disentangles and refines high-level cues, enabling precise object boundary delineation at the pixel level. In this paper, we introduce a novel transformer-based decoder called MUSTER, which seamlessly integrates with hierarchical encoders and consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results, regardless of the encoder architecture. Furthermore, we present a variant of MUSTER that reduces FLOPS while maintaining performance. MUSTER incorporates carefully designed multi-head skip attention (MSKA) units and introduces innovative upsampling operations. The MSKA units enable the fusion of multi-scale features from the encoder and decoder, facilitating comprehensive information integration. The upsampling operation leverages encoder features to enhance object localization and surpasses traditional upsampling methods, improving mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) by 0.4% to 3.2%. On the challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model achieves a single-scale mIoU of 50.23 and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.88, which is on-par with the current state-of-the-art model. Remarkably, we achieve this while significantly reducing the number of FLOPs by 61.3%. Our source code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/shiwt03/MUSTER."
2211.13984,Aggregated Text Transformer for Scene Text Detection,"This paper explores the multi-scale aggregation strategy for scene text detection in natural images. We present the Aggregated Text TRansformer(ATTR), which is designed to represent texts in scene images with a multi-scale self-attention mechanism. Starting from the image pyramid with multiple resolutions, the features are first extracted at different scales with shared weight and then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture of Transformer. The multi-scale image representations are robust and contain rich information on text contents of various sizes. The text Transformer aggregates these features to learn the interaction across different scales and improve text representation. The proposed method detects scene texts by representing each text instance as an individual binary mask, which is tolerant of curve texts and regions with dense instances. Extensive experiments on public scene text detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
2211.14049,Task-Oriented Communication for Edge Video Analytics,"With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and the increasing popularity of camera-equipped devices, many edge video analytics applications are emerging, calling for the deployment of computation-intensive AI models at the network edge. Edge inference is a promising solution to move the computation-intensive workloads from low-end devices to a powerful edge server for video analytics, but the device-server communications will remain a bottleneck due to the limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a task-oriented communication framework for edge video analytics, where multiple devices collect the visual sensory data and transmit the informative features to an edge server for processing. To enable low-latency inference, this framework removes video redundancy in spatial and temporal domains and transmits minimal information that is essential for the downstream task, rather than reconstructing the videos at the edge server. Specifically, it extracts compact task-relevant features based on the deterministic information bottleneck (IB) principle, which characterizes a tradeoff between the informativeness of the features and the communication cost. As the features of consecutive frames are temporally correlated, we propose a temporal entropy model (TEM) to reduce the bitrate by taking the previous features as side information in feature encoding. To further improve the inference performance, we build a spatial-temporal fusion module at the server to integrate features of the current and previous frames for joint inference. Extensive experiments on video analytics tasks evidence that the proposed framework effectively encodes task-relevant information of video data and achieves a better rate-performance tradeoff than existing methods."
2211.14054,CAD2Render: A Modular Toolkit for GPU-accelerated Photorealistic   Synthetic Data Generation for the Manufacturing Industry,"The use of computer vision for product and assembly quality control is becoming ubiquitous in the manufacturing industry. Lately, it is apparent that machine learning based solutions are outperforming classical computer vision algorithms in terms of performance and robustness. However, a main drawback is that they require sufficiently large and labeled training datasets, which are often not available or too tedious and too time consuming to acquire. This is especially true for low-volume and high-variance manufacturing. Fortunately, in this industry, CAD models of the manufactured or assembled products are available. This paper introduces CAD2Render, a GPU-accelerated synthetic data generator based on the Unity High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). CAD2Render is designed to add variations in a modular fashion, making it possible for high customizable data generation, tailored to the needs of the industrial use case at hand. Although CAD2Render is specifically designed for manufacturing use cases, it can be used for other domains as well. We validate CAD2Render by demonstrating state of the art performance in two industrial relevant setups. We demonstrate that the data generated by our approach can be used to train object detection and pose estimation models with a high enough accuracy to direct a robot. The code for CAD2Render is available at https://github.com/EDM-Research/CAD2Render."
2211.14154,Interaction Region Visual Transformer for Egocentric Action Anticipation,"Human-object interaction is one of the most important visual cues and we propose a novel way to represent human-object interactions for egocentric action anticipation. We propose a novel transformer variant to model interactions by computing the change in the appearance of objects and human hands due to the execution of the actions and use those changes to refine the video representation. Specifically, we model interactions between hands and objects using Spatial Cross-Attention (SCA) and further infuse contextual information using Trajectory Cross-Attention to obtain environment-refined interaction tokens. Using these tokens, we construct an interaction-centric video representation for action anticipation. We term our model InAViT which achieves state-of-the-art action anticipation performance on large-scale egocentric datasets EPICKTICHENS100 (EK100) and EGTEA Gaze+. InAViT outperforms other visual transformer-based methods including object-centric video representation. On the EK100 evaluation server, InAViT is the top-performing method on the public leaderboard (at the time of submission) where it outperforms the second-best model by 3.3% on mean-top5 recall."
2211.14235,DoubleU-NetPlus: A Novel Attention and Context Guided Dual U-Net with   Multi-Scale Residual Feature Fusion Network for Semantic Segmentation of   Medical Images,"Accurate segmentation of the region of interest in medical images can provide an essential pathway for devising effective treatment plans for life-threatening diseases. It is still challenging for U-Net, and its state-of-the-art variants, such as CE-Net and DoubleU-Net, to effectively model the higher-level output feature maps of the convolutional units of the network mostly due to the presence of various scales of the region of interest, intricacy of context environments, ambiguous boundaries, and multiformity of textures in medical images. In this paper, we exploit multi-contextual features and several attention strategies to increase networks' ability to model discriminative feature representation for more accurate medical image segmentation, and we present a novel dual U-Net-based architecture named DoubleU-NetPlus. The DoubleU-NetPlus incorporates several architectural modifications. In particular, we integrate EfficientNetB7 as the feature encoder module, a newly designed multi-kernel residual convolution module, and an adaptive feature re-calibrating attention-based atrous spatial pyramid pooling module to progressively and precisely accumulate discriminative multi-scale high-level contextual feature maps and emphasize the salient regions. In addition, we introduce a novel triple attention gate module and a hybrid triple attention module to encourage selective modeling of relevant medical image features. Moreover, to mitigate the gradient vanishing issue and incorporate high-resolution features with deeper spatial details, the standard convolution operation is replaced with the attention-guided residual convolution operations, ..."
2211.14282,Domain generalization in fetal brain MRI segmentation \\with   multi-reconstruction augmentation,"Quantitative analysis of in utero human brain development is crucial for abnormal characterization. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation is therefore an asset for quantitative analysis. However, the development of automated segmentation methods is hampered by the scarce availability of fetal brain MRI annotated datasets and the limited variability within these cohorts. In this context, we propose to leverage the power of fetal brain MRI super-resolution (SR) reconstruction methods to generate multiple reconstructions of a single subject with different parameters, thus as an efficient tuning-free data augmentation strategy. Overall, the latter significantly improves the generalization of segmentation methods over SR pipelines."
2211.14298,PIP: Positional-encoding Image Prior,"In Deep Image Prior (DIP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is fitted to map a latent space to a degraded (e.g. noisy) image but in the process learns to reconstruct the clean image. This phenomenon is attributed to CNN's internal image-prior. We revisit the DIP framework, examining it from the perspective of a neural implicit representation. Motivated by this perspective, we replace the random or learned latent with Fourier-Features (Positional Encoding). We show that thanks to the Fourier features properties, we can replace the convolution layers with simple pixel-level MLPs. We name this scheme ``Positional Encoding Image Prior"" (PIP) and exhibit that it performs very similarly to DIP on various image-reconstruction tasks with much less parameters required. Additionally, we demonstrate that PIP can be easily extended to videos, where 3D-DIP struggles and suffers from instability. Code and additional examples for all tasks, including videos, are available on the project page https://nimrodshabtay.github.io/PIP/"
2211.14307,MAEDAY: MAE for few and zero shot AnomalY-Detection,"We propose using Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), a transformer model self-supervisedly trained on image inpainting, for anomaly detection (AD). Assuming anomalous regions are harder to reconstruct compared with normal regions. MAEDAY is the first image-reconstruction-based anomaly detection method that utilizes a pre-trained model, enabling its use for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD). We also show the same method works surprisingly well for the novel tasks of Zero-Shot AD (ZSAD) and Zero-Shot Foreign Object Detection (ZSFOD), where no normal samples are available. Code is available at https://github.com/EliSchwartz/MAEDAY ."
2211.14309,FutureHuman3D: Forecasting Complex Long-Term 3D Human Behavior from   Video Observations,"We present a generative approach to forecast long-term future human behavior in 3D, requiring only weak supervision from readily available 2D human action data. This is a fundamental task enabling many downstream applications. The required ground-truth data is hard to capture in 3D (mocap suits, expensive setups) but easy to acquire in 2D (simple RGB cameras). Thus, we design our method to only require 2D RGB data at inference time while being able to generate 3D human motion sequences. We use a differentiable 2D projection scheme in an autoregressive manner for weak supervision, and an adversarial loss for 3D regularization. Our method predicts long and complex human behavior sequences (e.g., cooking, assembly) consisting of multiple sub-actions. We tackle this in a semantically hierarchical manner, jointly predicting high-level coarse action labels together with their low-level fine-grained realizations as characteristic 3D human poses. We observe that these two action representations are coupled in nature, and joint prediction benefits both action and pose forecasting. Our experiments demonstrate the complementary nature of joint action and 3D pose prediction: our joint approach outperforms each task treated individually, enables robust longer-term sequence prediction, and improves over alternative approaches to forecast actions and characteristic 3D poses."
2211.14310,"Efficient 3D Reconstruction, Streaming and Visualization of Static and   Dynamic Scene Parts for Multi-client Live-telepresence in Large-scale   Environments","Despite the impressive progress of telepresence systems for room-scale scenes with static and dynamic scene entities, expanding their capabilities to scenarios with larger dynamic environments beyond a fixed size of a few square-meters remains challenging.   In this paper, we aim at sharing 3D live-telepresence experiences in large-scale environments beyond room scale with both static and dynamic scene entities at practical bandwidth requirements only based on light-weight scene capture with a single moving consumer-grade RGB-D camera. To this end, we present a system which is built upon a novel hybrid volumetric scene representation in terms of the combination of a voxel-based scene representation for the static contents, that not only stores the reconstructed surface geometry but also contains information about the object semantics as well as their accumulated dynamic movement over time, and a point-cloud-based representation for dynamic scene parts, where the respective separation from static parts is achieved based on semantic and instance information extracted for the input frames. With an independent yet simultaneous streaming of both static and dynamic content, where we seamlessly integrate potentially moving but currently static scene entities in the static model until they are becoming dynamic again, as well as the fusion of static and dynamic data at the remote client, our system is able to achieve VR-based live-telepresence at close to real-time rates. Our evaluation demonstrates the potential of our novel approach in terms of visual quality, performance, and ablation studies regarding involved design choices."
2211.14312,Karyotype AI for Precision Oncology,"We present a machine learning method capable of accurately detecting chromosome abnormalities that cause blood cancers directly from microscope images of the metaphase stage of cell division. The pipeline is built on a series of fine-tuned Vision Transformers. Current state of the art (and standard clinical practice) requires expensive, manual expert analysis, whereas our pipeline takes only 15 seconds per metaphase image. Using a novel pretraining-finetuning strategy to mitigate the challenge of data scarcity, we achieve a high precision-recall score of 94% AUC for the clinically significant del(5q) and t(9;22) anomalies. Our method also unlocks zero-shot detection of rare aberrations based on model latent embeddings. The ability to quickly, accurately, and scalably diagnose genetic abnormalities directly from metaphase images could transform karyotyping practice and improve patient outcomes. We will make code publicly available."
2211.14396,Non-invasive Liver Fibrosis Screening on CT Images using Radiomics,"Objectives: To develop and evaluate a radiomics machine learning model for detecting liver fibrosis on CT of the liver.   Methods: For this retrospective, single-centre study, radiomic features were extracted from Regions of Interest (ROIs) on CT images of patients who underwent simultaneous liver biopsy and CT examinations. Combinations of contrast, normalization, machine learning model, and feature selection method were determined based on their mean test Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) on randomly placed ROIs. The combination and selected features with the highest AUC were used to develop a final liver fibrosis screening model.   Results: The study included 101 male and 68 female patients (mean age = 51.2 years $\pm$ 14.7 [SD]). When averaging the AUC across all combinations, non-contrast enhanced (NC) CT (AUC, 0.6100; 95% CI: 0.5897, 0.6303) outperformed contrast-enhanced CT (AUC, 0.5680; 95% CI: 0.5471, 0.5890). The combination of hyperparameters and features that yielded the highest AUC was a logistic regression model with inputs features of maximum, energy, kurtosis, skewness, and small area high gray level emphasis extracted from non-contrast enhanced NC CT normalized using Gamma correction with $\gamma$ = 1.5 (AUC, 0.7833; 95% CI: 0.7821, 0.7845), (sensitivity, 0.9091; 95% CI: 0.9091, 0.9091).   Conclusions: Radiomics-based machine learning models allow for the detection of liver fibrosis with reasonable accuracy and high sensitivity on NC CT. Thus, these models can be used to non-invasively screen for liver fibrosis, contributing to earlier detection of the disease at a potentially curable stage."
2211.14456,TetraSphere: A Neural Descriptor for O(3)-Invariant Point Cloud Analysis,"In many practical applications, 3D point cloud analysis requires rotation invariance. In this paper, we present a learnable descriptor invariant under 3D rotations and reflections, i.e., the O(3) actions, utilizing the recently introduced steerable 3D spherical neurons and vector neurons. Specifically, we propose an embedding of the 3D spherical neurons into 4D vector neurons, which leverages end-to-end training of the model. In our approach, we perform TetraTransform--an equivariant embedding of the 3D input into 4D, constructed from the steerable neurons--and extract deeper O(3)-equivariant features using vector neurons. This integration of the TetraTransform into the VN-DGCNN framework, termed TetraSphere, negligibly increases the number of parameters by less than 0.0002%. TetraSphere sets a new state-of-the-art performance classifying randomly rotated real-world object scans of the challenging subsets of ScanObjectNN. Additionally, TetraSphere outperforms all equivariant methods on randomly rotated synthetic data: classifying objects from ModelNet40 and segmenting parts of the ShapeNet shapes. Thus, our results reveal the practical value of steerable 3D spherical neurons for learning in 3D Euclidean space. The code is available at https://github.com/pavlo-melnyk/tetrasphere."
2211.14513,Rethinking Alignment and Uniformity in Unsupervised Semantic   Segmentation,"Unsupervised image semantic segmentation(UISS) aims to match low-level visual features with semantic-level representations without outer supervision. In this paper, we address the critical properties from the view of feature alignments and feature uniformity for UISS models. We also make a comparison between UISS and image-wise representation learning. Based on the analysis, we argue that the existing MI-based methods in UISS suffer from representation collapse. By this, we proposed a robust network called Semantic Attention Network(SAN), in which a new module Semantic Attention(SEAT) is proposed to generate pixel-wise and semantic features dynamically. Experimental results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks show that our unsupervised segmentation framework specializes in catching semantic representations, which outperforms all the unpretrained and even several pretrained methods."
2211.14743,Searching for Uncollected Litter with Computer Vision,"This study combines photo metadata and computer vision to quantify where uncollected litter is present. Images from the Trash Annotations in Context (TACO) dataset were used to teach an algorithm to detect 10 categories of garbage. Although it worked well with smartphone photos, it struggled when trying to process images from vehicle mounted cameras. However, increasing the variety of perspectives and backgrounds in the dataset will help it improve in unfamiliar situations. These data are plotted onto a map which, as accuracy improves, could be used for measuring waste management strategies and quantifying trends."
2211.14769,Navigation as Attackers Wish? Towards Building Robust Embodied Agents   under Federated Learning,"Federated embodied agent learning protects the data privacy of individual visual environments by keeping data locally at each client (the individual environment) during training. However, since the local data is inaccessible to the server under federated learning, attackers may easily poison the training data of the local client to build a backdoor in the agent without notice. Deploying such an agent raises the risk of potential harm to humans, as the attackers may easily navigate and control the agent as they wish via the backdoor. Towards Byzantine-robust federated embodied agent learning, in this paper, we study the attack and defense for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), where the agent is required to follow natural language instructions to navigate indoor environments. First, we introduce a simple but effective attack strategy, Navigation as Wish (NAW), in which the malicious client manipulates local trajectory data to implant a backdoor into the global model. Results on two VLN datasets (R2R and RxR) show that NAW can easily navigate the deployed VLN agent regardless of the language instruction, without affecting its performance on normal test sets. Then, we propose a new Prompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) to defend against the NAW attack in federated VLN, which provides the server with a ''prompt'' of the vision-and-language alignment variance between the benign and malicious clients so that they can be distinguished during training. We validate the effectiveness of the PBA method on protecting the global model from the NAW attack, which outperforms other state-of-the-art defense methods by a large margin in the defense metrics on R2R and RxR."
2211.14823,3D Scene Creation and Rendering via Rough Meshes: A Lighting Transfer   Avenue,"This paper studies how to flexibly integrate reconstructed 3D models into practical 3D modeling pipelines such as 3D scene creation and rendering. Due to the technical difficulty, one can only obtain rough 3D models (R3DMs) for most real objects using existing 3D reconstruction techniques. As a result, physically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for scenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be representing real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able to generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints. However, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields Rendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR pipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause local shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network (LighTNet) to bridge NFR and PBR, such that they can benefit from each other. LighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the uneven surface issue caused by R3DMs, and is empowered by several perceptual-motivated constraints and a new Lab angle loss which enhances the contrast between lighting strength and colors. Comparisons demonstrate that LighTNet is superior in synthesizing impressive lighting, and is promising in pushing NFR further in practical 3D modeling workflows."
2211.14835,CLID: Controlled-Length Image Descriptions with Limited Data,"Controllable image captioning models generate human-like image descriptions, enabling some kind of control over the generated captions. This paper focuses on controlling the caption length, i.e. a short and concise description or a long and detailed one. Since existing image captioning datasets contain mostly short captions, generating long captions is challenging. To address the shortage of long training examples, we propose to enrich the dataset with varying-length self-generated captions. These, however, might be of varying quality and are thus unsuitable for conventional training. We introduce a novel training strategy that selects the data points to be used at different times during the training. Our method dramatically improves the length-control abilities, while exhibiting SoTA performance in terms of caption quality. Our approach is general and is shown to be applicable also to paragraph generation."
2211.14912,Impact of Strategic Sampling and Supervision Policies on Semi-supervised   Learning,"In semi-supervised representation learning frameworks, when the number of labelled data is very scarce, the quality and representativeness of these samples become increasingly important. Existing literature on semi-supervised learning randomly sample a limited number of data points for labelling. All these labelled samples are then used along with the unlabelled data throughout the training process. In this work, we ask two important questions in this context: (1) does it matter which samples are selected for labelling? (2) does it matter how the labelled samples are used throughout the training process along with the unlabelled data? To answer the first question, we explore a number of unsupervised methods for selecting specific subsets of data to label (without prior knowledge of their labels), with the goal of maximizing representativeness w.r.t. the unlabelled set. Then, for our second line of inquiry, we define a variety of different label injection strategies in the training process. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and STL-10, show that unsupervised selection of samples that are more representative of the entire data improves performance by up to ~2% over the existing semi-supervised frameworks such as MixMatch, ReMixMatch, FixMatch and others with random sample labelling. We show that this boost could even increase to 7.5% for very few-labelled scenarios. However, our study shows that gradually injecting the labels throughout the training procedure does not impact the performance considerably versus when all the existing labels are used throughout the entire training."
2211.14950,Leveraging Image Matching Toward End-to-End Relative Camera Pose   Regression,"This paper proposes a generalizable, end-to-end deep learning-based method for relative pose regression between two images. Given two images of the same scene captured from different viewpoints, our method predicts the relative rotation and translation (including direction and scale) between the two respective cameras. Inspired by the classical pipeline, our method leverages Image Matching (IM) as a pre-trained task for relative pose regression. Specifically, we use LoFTR, an architecture that utilizes an attention-based network pre-trained on Scannet, to extract semi-dense feature maps, which are then warped and fed into a pose regression network. Notably, we use a loss function that utilizes separate terms to account for the translation direction and scale. We believe such a separation is important because translation direction is determined by point correspondences while the scale is inferred from prior on shape sizes. Our ablations further support this choice. We evaluate our method on several datasets and show that it outperforms previous end-to-end methods. The method also generalizes well to unseen datasets."
2211.15055,AdaTask: A Task-aware Adaptive Learning Rate Approach to Multi-task   Learning,"Multi-task learning (MTL) models have demonstrated impressive results in computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. Even though many approaches have been proposed, how well these approaches balance different tasks on each parameter still remains unclear. In this paper, we propose to measure the task dominance degree of a parameter by the total updates of each task on this parameter. Specifically, we compute the total updates by the exponentially decaying Average of the squared Updates (AU) on a parameter from the corresponding task.Based on this novel metric, we observe that many parameters in existing MTL methods, especially those in the higher shared layers, are still dominated by one or several tasks. The dominance of AU is mainly due to the dominance of accumulative gradients from one or several tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a Task-wise Adaptive learning rate approach, AdaTask in short, to separate the \emph{accumulative gradients} and hence the learning rate of each task for each parameter in adaptive learning rate approaches (e.g., AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam). Comprehensive experiments on computer vision and recommender system MTL datasets demonstrate that AdaTask significantly improves the performance of dominated tasks, resulting SOTA average task-wise performance. Analysis on both synthetic and real-world datasets shows AdaTask balance parameters in every shared layer well."
2211.15143,Explaining Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification   by Evolving Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations,"Deep convolutional neural networks have proven their effectiveness, and have been acknowledged as the most dominant method for image classification. However, a severe drawback of deep convolutional neural networks is poor explainability. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, users need to understand the rationale behind the predictions of deep convolutional neural networks when determining whether they should trust the predictions or not. To resolve this issue, a novel genetic algorithm-based method is proposed for the first time to automatically evolve local explanations that can assist users to assess the rationality of the predictions. Furthermore, the proposed method is model-agnostic, i.e., it can be utilised to explain any deep convolutional neural network models. In the experiments, ResNet is used as an example model to be explained, and the ImageNet dataset is selected as the benchmark dataset. DenseNet and MobileNet are further explained to demonstrate the model-agnostic characteristic of the proposed method. The evolved local explanations on four images, randomly selected from ImageNet, are presented, which show that the evolved local explanations are straightforward to be recognised by humans. Moreover, the evolved explanations can explain the predictions of deep convolutional neural networks on all four images very well by successfully capturing meaningful interpretable features of the sample images. Further analysis based on the 30 runs of the experiments exhibits that the evolved local explanations can also improve the probabilities/confidences of the deep convolutional neural network models in making the predictions. The proposed method can obtain local explanations within one minute, which is more than ten times faster than LIME (the state-of-the-art method)."
2211.15341,Non-inferiority of Deep Learning Acute Ischemic Stroke Segmentation on   Non-Contrast CT Compared to Expert Neuroradiologists,"To determine if a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model can accurately segment acute ischemic changes on non-contrast CT compared to neuroradiologists. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) examinations from 232 acute ischemic stroke patients who were enrolled in the DEFUSE 3 trial were included in this study. Three experienced neuroradiologists independently segmented hypodensity that reflected the ischemic core on each scan. The neuroradiologist with the most experience (expert A) served as the ground truth for deep learning model training. Two additional neuroradiologists (experts B and C) segmentations were used for data testing. The 232 studies were randomly split into training and test sets. The training set was further randomly divided into 5 folds with training and validation sets. A 3-dimensional CNN architecture was trained and optimized to predict the segmentations of expert A from NCCT. The performance of the model was assessed using a set of volume, overlap, and distance metrics using non-inferiority thresholds of 20%, 3ml, and 3mm. The optimized model trained on expert A was compared to test experts B and C. We used a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test for the non-inferiority of the model-expert compared to the inter-expert agreement. The final model performance for the ischemic core segmentation task reached a performance of 0.46+-0.09 Surface Dice at Tolerance 5mm and 0.47+-0.13 Dice when trained on expert A. Compared to the two test neuroradiologists the model-expert agreement was non-inferior to the inter-expert agreement, p < 0.05. The CNN accurately delineates the hypodense ischemic core on NCCT in acute ischemic stroke patients with an accuracy comparable to neuroradiologists."
2211.15362,Exploring the Coordination of Frequency and Attention in Masked Image   Modeling,"Recently, masked image modeling (MIM), which learns visual representations by reconstructing the masked patches of an image, has dominated self-supervised learning in computer vision. However, the pre-training of MIM always takes massive time due to the large-scale data and large-size backbones. We mainly attribute it to the random patch masking in previous MIM works, which fails to leverage the crucial semantic information for effective visual representation learning. To tackle this issue, we propose the Frequency \& Attention-driven Masking and Throwing Strategy (FAMT), which can extract semantic patches and reduce the number of training patches to boost model performance and training efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, FAMT utilizes the self-attention mechanism to extract semantic information from the image for masking during training in an unsupervised manner. However, attention alone could sometimes focus on inappropriate areas regarding the semantic information. Thus, we are motivated to incorporate the information from the frequency domain into the self-attention mechanism to derive the sampling weights for masking, which captures semantic patches for visual representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a patch throwing strategy based on the derived sampling weights to reduce the training cost. FAMT can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module and surpasses previous works, \emph{e.g.} reducing the training phase time by nearly $50\%$ and improving the linear probing accuracy of MAE by $1.3\% \sim 3.9\%$ across various datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K. FAMT also demonstrates superior performance in downstream detection and segmentation tasks."
2211.15374,Identification of Surface Defects on Solar PV Panels and Wind Turbine   Blades using Attention based Deep Learning Model,"The global generation of renewable energy has rapidly increased, primarily due to the installation of large-scale renewable energy power plants. However, monitoring renewable energy assets in these large plants remains challenging due to environmental factors that could result in reduced power generation, malfunctioning, and degradation of asset life. Therefore, the detection of surface defects on renewable energy assets is crucial for maintaining the performance and efficiency of these plants. This paper proposes an innovative detection framework to achieve an economical surface monitoring system for renewable energy assets. High-resolution images of the assets are captured regularly and inspected to identify surface or structural damages on solar panels and wind turbine blades. {Vision transformer (ViT), one of the latest attention-based deep learning (DL) models in computer vision, is proposed in this work to classify surface defects.} The ViT model outperforms other DL models, including MobileNet, VGG16, Xception, EfficientNetB7, and ResNet50, achieving high accuracy scores above 97\% for both wind and solar plant assets. From the results, our proposed model demonstrates its potential for monitoring and detecting damages in renewable energy assets for efficient and reliable operation of renewable power plants."
2211.15406,Automated Detection of Dolphin Whistles with Convolutional Networks and   Transfer Learning,"Effective conservation of maritime environments and wildlife management of endangered species require the implementation of efficient, accurate and scalable solutions for environmental monitoring. Ecoacoustics offers the advantages of non-invasive, long-duration sampling of environmental sounds and has the potential to become the reference tool for biodiversity surveying. However, the analysis and interpretation of acoustic data is a time-consuming process that often requires a great amount of human supervision. This issue might be tackled by exploiting modern techniques for automatic audio signal analysis, which have recently achieved impressive performance thanks to the advances in deep learning research. In this paper we show that convolutional neural networks can indeed significantly outperform traditional automatic methods in a challenging detection task: identification of dolphin whistles from underwater audio recordings. The proposed system can detect signals even in the presence of ambient noise, at the same time consistently reducing the likelihood of producing false positives and false negatives. Our results further support the adoption of artificial intelligence technology to improve the automatic monitoring of marine ecosystems."
2211.15597,Lightning Fast Video Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Knowledge   Distillation,"We propose a very fast frame-level model for anomaly detection in video, which learns to detect anomalies by distilling knowledge from multiple highly accurate object-level teacher models. To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive ablation study to justify our architectural design choices. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/fast-aed."
2211.15656,SuperFusion: Multilevel LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Long-Range HD Map   Generation,"High-definition (HD) semantic map generation of the environment is an essential component of autonomous driving. Existing methods have achieved good performance in this task by fusing different sensor modalities, such as LiDAR and camera. However, current works are based on raw data or network feature-level fusion and only consider short-range HD map generation, limiting their deployment to realistic autonomous driving applications. In this paper, we focus on the task of building the HD maps in both short ranges, i.e., within 30 m, and also predicting long-range HD maps up to 90 m, which is required by downstream path planning and control tasks to improve the smoothness and safety of autonomous driving. To this end, we propose a novel network named SuperFusion, exploiting the fusion of LiDAR and camera data at multiple levels. We use LiDAR depth to improve image depth estimation and use image features to guide long-range LiDAR feature prediction. We benchmark our SuperFusion on the nuScenes dataset and a self-recorded dataset and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods with large margins on all intervals. Additionally, we apply the generated HD map to a downstream path planning task, demonstrating that the long-range HD maps predicted by our method can lead to better path planning for autonomous vehicles. Our code has been released at https://github.com/haomo-ai/SuperFusion."
2211.15759,PIDS: Joint Point Interaction-Dimension Search for 3D Point Cloud,"The interaction and dimension of points are two important axes in designing point operators to serve hierarchical 3D models. Yet, these two axes are heterogeneous and challenging to fully explore. Existing works craft point operator under a single axis and reuse the crafted operator in all parts of 3D models. This overlooks the opportunity to better combine point interactions and dimensions by exploiting varying geometry/density of 3D point clouds. In this work, we establish PIDS, a novel paradigm to jointly explore point interactions and point dimensions to serve semantic segmentation on point cloud data. We establish a large search space to jointly consider versatile point interactions and point dimensions. This supports point operators with various geometry/density considerations. The enlarged search space with heterogeneous search components calls for a better ranking of candidate models. To achieve this, we improve the search space exploration by leveraging predictor-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and enhance the quality of prediction by assigning unique encoding to heterogeneous search components based on their priors. We thoroughly evaluate the networks crafted by PIDS on two semantic segmentation benchmarks, showing ~1% mIOU improvement on SemanticKITTI and S3DIS over state-of-the-art 3D models."
2211.15918,Similarity Distribution based Membership Inference Attack on Person   Re-identification,"While person Re-identification (Re-ID) has progressed rapidly due to its wide real-world applications, it also causes severe risks of leaking personal information from training data. Thus, this paper focuses on quantifying this risk by membership inference (MI) attack. Most of the existing MI attack algorithms focus on classification models, while Re-ID follows a totally different training and inference paradigm. Re-ID is a fine-grained recognition task with complex feature embedding, and model outputs commonly used by existing MI like logits and losses are not accessible during inference. Since Re-ID focuses on modelling the relative relationship between image pairs instead of individual semantics, we conduct a formal and empirical analysis which validates that the distribution shift of the inter-sample similarity between training and test set is a critical criterion for Re-ID membership inference. As a result, we propose a novel membership inference attack method based on the inter-sample similarity distribution. Specifically, a set of anchor images are sampled to represent the similarity distribution conditioned on a target image, and a neural network with a novel anchor selection module is proposed to predict the membership of the target image. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both the Re-ID task and conventional classification task."
2211.15975,Analyzing Infrastructure LiDAR Placement with Realistic LiDAR Simulation   Library,"Recently, Vehicle-to-Everything(V2X) cooperative perception has attracted increasing attention. Infrastructure sensors play a critical role in this research field; however, how to find the optimal placement of infrastructure sensors is rarely studied. In this paper, we investigate the problem of infrastructure sensor placement and propose a pipeline that can efficiently and effectively find optimal installation positions for infrastructure sensors in a realistic simulated environment. To better simulate and evaluate LiDAR placement, we establish a Realistic LiDAR Simulation library that can simulate the unique characteristics of different popular LiDARs and produce high-fidelity LiDAR point clouds in the CARLA simulator. Through simulating point cloud data in different LiDAR placements, we can evaluate the perception accuracy of these placements using multiple detection models. Then, we analyze the correlation between the point cloud distribution and perception accuracy by calculating the density and uniformity of regions of interest. Experiments show that when using the same number and type of LiDAR, the placement scheme optimized by our proposed method improves the average precision by 15%, compared with the conventional placement scheme in the standard lane scene. We also analyze the correlation between perception performance in the region of interest and LiDAR point cloud distribution and validate that density and uniformity can be indicators of performance. Both the RLS Library and related code will be released at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/PCSim."
2211.16005,Convex Relaxations for Isometric and Equiareal NRSfM,"Extensible objects form a challenging case for NRSfM, owing to the lack of a sufficiently constrained extensible model of the point-cloud. We tackle the challenge by proposing 1) convex relaxations of the isometric model up to quasi-isometry, and 2) convex relaxations involving the equiareal deformation model, which preserves local area and has not been used in NRSfM. The equiareal model is appealing because it is physically plausible and widely applicable. However, it has two main difficulties: first, when used on its own, it is ambiguous, and second, it involves quartic, hence highly nonconvex, constraints. Our approach handles the first difficulty by mixing the equiareal with the isometric model and the second difficulty by new convex relaxations. We validate our methods on multiple real and synthetic data, including well-known benchmarks."
2211.16098,Three-stage binarization of color document images based on discrete   wavelet transform and generative adversarial networks,"The efficient extraction of text information from the background in degraded color document images is an important challenge in the preservation of ancient manuscripts. The imperfect preservation of ancient manuscripts has led to different types of degradation over time, such as page yellowing, staining, and ink bleeding, seriously affecting the results of document image binarization. This work proposes an effective three-stage network method to image enhancement and binarization of degraded documents using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, in Stage-1, we first split the input images into multiple patches, and then split these patches into four single-channel patch images (gray, red, green, and blue). Then, three single-channel patch images (red, green, and blue) are processed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with normalization. In Stage-2, we use four independent generators to separately train GAN models based on the four channels on the processed patch images to extract color foreground information. Finally, in Stage-3, we train two independent GAN models on the outputs of Stage-2 and the resized original input images (512x512) as the local and global predictions to obtain the final outputs. The experimental results show that the Avg-Score metrics of the proposed method are 77.64, 77.95, 79.05, 76.38, 75.34, and 77.00 on the (H)-DIBCO 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 datasets, which are at the state-of-the-art level. The implementation code for this work is available at https://github.com/abcpp12383/ThreeStageBinarization."
2211.16141,Mind the Gap: Scanner-induced domain shifts pose challenges for   representation learning in histopathology,"Computer-aided systems in histopathology are often challenged by various sources of domain shift that impact the performance of these algorithms considerably. We investigated the potential of using self-supervised pre-training to overcome scanner-induced domain shifts for the downstream task of tumor segmentation. For this, we present the Barlow Triplets to learn scanner-invariant representations from a multi-scanner dataset with local image correspondences. We show that self-supervised pre-training successfully aligned different scanner representations, which, interestingly only results in a limited benefit for our downstream task. We thereby provide insights into the influence of scanner characteristics for downstream applications and contribute to a better understanding of why established self-supervised methods have not yet shown the same success on histopathology data as they have for natural images."
2211.16213,Identification of Rare Cortical Folding Patterns using Unsupervised Deep   Learning,"Like fingerprints, cortical folding patterns are unique to each brain even though they follow a general species-specific organization. Some folding patterns have been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, due to the high inter-individual variability, the identification of rare folding patterns that could become biomarkers remains a very complex task. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised deep learning approach to identify rare folding patterns and assess the degree of deviations that can be detected. To this end, we preprocess the brain MR images to focus the learning on the folding morphology and train a beta-VAE to model the inter-individual variability of the folding. We compare the detection power of the latent space and of the reconstruction errors, using synthetic benchmarks and one actual rare configuration related to the central sulcus. Finally, we assess the generalization of our method on a developmental anomaly located in another region. Our results suggest that this method enables encoding relevant folding characteristics that can be enlightened and better interpreted based on the generative power of the beta-VAE. The latent space and the reconstruction errors bring complementary information and enable the identification of rare patterns of different nature. This method generalizes well to a different region on another dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2022_lguillon_rare_folding_detection."
2211.16234,SimCS: Simulation for Domain Incremental Online Continual Segmentation,"Continual Learning is a step towards lifelong intelligence where models continuously learn from recently collected data without forgetting previous knowledge. Existing continual learning approaches mostly focus on image classification in the class-incremental setup with clear task boundaries and unlimited computational budget. This work explores the problem of Online Domain-Incremental Continual Segmentation (ODICS), where the model is continually trained over batches of densely labeled images from different domains, with limited computation and no information about the task boundaries. ODICS arises in many practical applications. In autonomous driving, this may correspond to the realistic scenario of training a segmentation model over time on a sequence of cities. We analyze several existing continual learning methods and show that they perform poorly in this setting despite working well in class-incremental segmentation. We propose SimCS, a parameter-free method complementary to existing ones that uses simulated data to regularize continual learning. Experiments show that SimCS provides consistent improvements when combined with different CL methods."
2211.16290,LocPoseNet: Robust Location Prior for Unseen Object Pose Estimation,"Object location prior is critical for the standard 6D object pose estimation setting. The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources. Our project website is at: https://sailor-z.github.io/projects/3DV2024_LocPoseNet.html."
2211.16570,"Performance Evaluation of Vanilla, Residual, and Dense 2D U-Net   Architectures for Skull Stripping of Augmented 3D T1-weighted MRI Head Scans","Skull Stripping is a requisite preliminary step in most diagnostic neuroimaging applications. Manual Skull Stripping methods define the gold standard for the domain but are time-consuming and challenging to integrate into processing pipelines with a high number of data samples. Automated methods are an active area of research for head MRI segmentation, especially deep learning methods such as U-Net architecture implementations. This study compares Vanilla, Residual, and Dense 2D U-Net architectures for Skull Stripping. The Dense 2D U-Net architecture outperforms the Vanilla and Residual counterparts by achieving an accuracy of 99.75% on a test dataset. It is observed that dense interconnections in a U-Net encourage feature reuse across layers of the architecture and allow for shallower models with the strengths of a deeper network."
2211.16986,A Geometric Model for Polarization Imaging on Projective Cameras,"The vast majority of Shape-from-Polarization (SfP) methods work under the oversimplified assumption of using orthographic cameras. Indeed, it is still not well understood how to project the Stokes vectors when the incoming rays are not orthogonal to the image plane. We try to answer this question presenting a geometric model describing how a general projective camera captures the light polarization state. Based on the optical properties of a tilted polarizer, our model is implemented as a pre-processing operation acting on raw images, followed by a per-pixel rotation of the reconstructed normal field. In this way, all the existing SfP methods assuming orthographic cameras can behave like they were designed for projective ones. Moreover, our model is consistent with state-of-the-art forward and inverse renderers (like Mitsuba3 and ART), intrinsically enforces physical constraints among the captured channels, and handles demosaicing of DoFP sensors. Experiments on existing and new datasets demonstrate the accuracy of the model when applied to commercially available polarimetric cameras."
2211.17126,BEVUDA: Multi-geometric Space Alignments for Domain Adaptive BEV 3D   Object Detection,"Vision-centric bird-eye-view (BEV) perception has shown promising potential in autonomous driving. Recent works mainly focus on improving efficiency or accuracy but neglect the challenges when facing environment changing, resulting in severe degradation of transfer performance. For BEV perception, we figure out the significant domain gaps existing in typical real-world cross-domain scenarios and comprehensively solve the Domain Adaption (DA) problem for multi-view 3D object detection. Since BEV perception approaches are complicated and contain several components, the domain shift accumulation on multiple geometric spaces (i.e., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) makes BEV DA even challenging. In this paper, we propose a Multi-space Alignment Teacher-Student (MATS) framework to ease the domain shift accumulation, which consists of a Depth-Aware Teacher (DAT) and a Geometric-space Aligned Student (GAS) model. DAT tactfully combines target lidar and reliable depth prediction to construct depth-aware information, extracting target domain-specific knowledge in Voxel and BEV feature spaces. It then transfers the sufficient domain knowledge of multiple spaces to the student model. In order to jointly alleviate the domain shift, GAS projects multi-geometric space features to a shared geometric embedding space and decreases data distribution distance between two domains. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct BEV 3D object detection experiments on three cross-domain scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance."
2212.00069,MrSARP: A Hierarchical Deep Generative Prior for SAR Image   Super-resolution,"Generative models learned from training using deep learning methods can be used as priors in inverse under-determined inverse problems, including imaging from sparse set of measurements. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical deep-generative model MrSARP for SAR imagery that can synthesize SAR images of a target at different resolutions jointly. MrSARP is trained in conjunction with a critic that scores multi resolution images jointly to decide if they are realistic images of a target at different resolutions. We show how this deep generative model can be used to retrieve the high spatial resolution image from low resolution images of the same target. The cost function of the generator is modified to improve its capability to retrieve the input parameters for a given set of resolution images. We evaluate the model's performance using the three standard error metrics used for evaluating super-resolution performance on simulated data and compare it to upsampling and sparsity based image sharpening approaches."
2212.00210,Shape-Guided Diffusion with Inside-Outside Attention,"We introduce precise object silhouette as a new form of user control in text-to-image diffusion models, which we dub Shape-Guided Diffusion. Our training-free method uses an Inside-Outside Attention mechanism during the inversion and generation process to apply a shape constraint to the cross- and self-attention maps. Our mechanism designates which spatial region is the object (inside) vs. background (outside) then associates edits to the correct region. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the shape-guided editing task, where the model must replace an object according to a text prompt and object mask. We curate a new ShapePrompts benchmark derived from MS-COCO and achieve SOTA results in shape faithfulness without a degradation in text alignment or image realism according to both automatic metrics and annotator ratings. Our data and code will be made available at https://shape-guided-diffusion.github.io."
2212.00214,Test-Time Mixup Augmentation for Data and Class-Specific Uncertainty   Estimation in Deep Learning Image Classification,"Uncertainty estimation of trained deep learning networks is valuable for optimizing learning efficiency and evaluating the reliability of network predictions. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating uncertainty in deep learning image classification using test-time mixup augmentation (TTMA). To improve the ability to distinguish correct and incorrect predictions in existing aleatoric uncertainty, we introduce TTMA data uncertainty (TTMA-DU) by applying mixup augmentation to test data and measuring the entropy of the predicted label histogram. In addition to TTMA-DU, we propose TTMA class-specific uncertainty (TTMA-CSU), which captures aleatoric uncertainty specific to individual classes and provides insight into class confusion and class similarity within the trained network. We validate our proposed methods on the ISIC-18 skin lesion diagnosis dataset and the CIFAR-100 real-world image classification dataset. Our experiments show that (1) TTMA-DU more effectively differentiates correct and incorrect predictions compared to existing uncertainty measures due to mixup perturbation, and (2) TTMA-CSU provides information on class confusion and class similarity for both datasets."
2212.00281,Localization vs. Semantics: Visual Representations in Unimodal and   Multimodal Models,"Despite the impressive advancements achieved through vision-and-language pretraining, it remains unclear whether this joint learning paradigm can help understand each individual modality. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of the visual representations in existing vision-and-language models and vision-only models by probing a broad range of tasks, aiming to assess the quality of the learned representations in a nuanced manner. Interestingly, our empirical observations suggest that vision-and-language models are better at label prediction tasks like object and attribute prediction, while vision-only models are stronger at dense prediction tasks that require more localized information. We hope our study sheds light on the role of language in visual learning, and serves as an empirical guide for various pretrained models. Code will be released at https://github.com/Lizw14/visual_probing"
2212.00330,Reliable Joint Segmentation of Retinal Edema Lesions in OCT Images,"Focusing on the complicated pathological features, such as blurred boundaries, severe scale differences between symptoms, background noise interference, etc., in the task of retinal edema lesions joint segmentation from OCT images and enabling the segmentation results more reliable. In this paper, we propose a novel reliable multi-scale wavelet-enhanced transformer network, which can provide accurate segmentation results with reliability assessment. Specifically, aiming at improving the model's ability to learn the complex pathological features of retinal edema lesions in OCT images, we develop a novel segmentation backbone that integrates a wavelet-enhanced feature extractor network and a multi-scale transformer module of our newly designed. Meanwhile, to make the segmentation results more reliable, a novel uncertainty segmentation head based on the subjective logical evidential theory is introduced to generate the final segmentation results with a corresponding overall uncertainty evaluation score map. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the public database of AI-Challenge 2018 for retinal edema lesions segmentation, and the results show that our proposed method achieves better segmentation accuracy with a high degree of reliability as compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. The code will be released on: https://github.com/LooKing9218/ReliableRESeg."
2212.00386,Automated Coronary Arteries Labeling Via Geometric Deep Learning,"Automatic labelling of anatomical structures, such as coronary arteries, is critical for diagnosis, yet existing (non-deep learning) methods are limited by a reliance on prior topological knowledge of the expected tree-like structures. As the structure such vascular systems is often difficult to conceptualize, graph-based representations have become popular due to their ability to capture the geometric and topological properties of the morphology in an orientation-independent and abstract manner. However, graph-based learning for automated labeling of tree-like anatomical structures has received limited attention in the literature. The majority of prior studies have limitations in the entity graph construction, are dependent on topological structures, and have limited accuracy due to the anatomical variability between subjects. In this paper, we propose an intuitive graph representation method, well suited to use with 3D coordinate data obtained from angiography scans. We subsequently seek to analyze subject-specific graphs using geometric deep learning. The proposed models leverage expert annotated labels from 141 patients to learn representations of each coronary segment, while capturing the effects of anatomical variability within the training data. We investigate different variants of so-called message passing neural networks. Through extensive evaluations, our pipeline achieves a promising weighted F1-score of 0.805 for labeling coronary artery (13 classes) for a five-fold cross-validation. Considering the ability of graph models in dealing with irregular data, and their scalability for data segmentation, this work highlights the potential of such methods to provide quantitative evidence to support the decisions of medical experts."
2212.00394,From CNNs to Shift-Invariant Twin Models Based on Complex Wavelets,"We propose a novel method to increase shift invariance and prediction accuracy in convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we replace the first-layer combination ""real-valued convolutions + max pooling"" (RMax) by ""complex-valued convolutions + modulus"" (CMod), which is stable to translations, or shifts. To justify our approach, we claim that CMod and RMax produce comparable outputs when the convolution kernel is band-pass and oriented (Gabor-like filter). In this context, CMod can therefore be considered as a stable alternative to RMax. To enforce this property, we constrain the convolution kernels to adopt such a Gabor-like structure. The corresponding architecture is called mathematical twin, because it employs a well-defined mathematical operator to mimic the behavior of the original, freely-trained model. Our approach achieves superior accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 classification tasks, compared to prior methods based on low-pass filtering. Arguably, our approach's emphasis on retaining high-frequency details contributes to a better balance between shift invariance and information preservation, resulting in improved performance. Furthermore, it has a lower computational cost and memory footprint than concurrent work, making it a promising solution for practical implementation."
2212.00422,Linear Combinations of Patches are Unreasonably Effective for   Single-Image Denoising,"In the past decade, deep neural networks have revolutionized image denoising in achieving significant accuracy improvements by learning on datasets composed of noisy/clean image pairs. However, this strategy is extremely dependent on training data quality, which is a well-established weakness. To alleviate the requirement to learn image priors externally, single-image (a.k.a., self-supervised or zero-shot) methods perform denoising solely based on the analysis of the input noisy image without external dictionary or training dataset. This work investigates the effectiveness of linear combinations of patches for denoising under this constraint. Although conceptually very simple, we show that linear combinations of patches are enough to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The proposed parametric approach relies on quadratic risk approximation via multiple pilot images to guide the estimation of the combination weights. Experiments on images corrupted artificially with Gaussian noise as well as on real-world noisy images demonstrate that our method is on par with the very best single-image denoisers, outperforming the recent neural network based techniques, while being much faster and fully interpretable."
2212.00459,Disparity-based Stereo Image Compression with Aligned Cross-View Priors,"With the wide application of stereo images in various fields, the research on stereo image compression (SIC) attracts extensive attention from academia and industry. The core of SIC is to fully explore the mutual information between the left and right images and reduce redundancy between views as much as possible. In this paper, we propose DispSIC, an end-to-end trainable deep neural network, in which we jointly train a stereo matching model to assist in the image compression task. Based on the stereo matching results (i.e. disparity), the right image can be easily warped to the left view, and only the residuals between the left and right views are encoded for the left image. A three-branch auto-encoder architecture is adopted in DispSIC, which encodes the right image, the disparity map and the residuals respectively. During training, the whole network can learn how to adaptively allocate bitrates to these three parts, achieving better rate-distortion performance at the cost of a lower disparity map bitrates. Moreover, we propose a conditional entropy model with aligned cross-view priors for SIC, which takes the warped latents of the right image as priors to improve the accuracy of the probability estimation for the left image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to other existing SIC methods on the KITTI and InStereo2K datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively."
2212.00479,Noisy Label Classification using Label Noise Selection with Test-Time   Augmentation Cross-Entropy and NoiseMix Learning,"As the size of the dataset used in deep learning tasks increases, the noisy label problem, which is a task of making deep learning robust to the incorrectly labeled data, has become an important task. In this paper, we propose a method of learning noisy label data using the label noise selection with test-time augmentation (TTA) cross-entropy and classifier learning with the NoiseMix method. In the label noise selection, we propose TTA cross-entropy by measuring the cross-entropy to predict the test-time augmented training data. In the classifier learning, we propose the NoiseMix method based on MixUp and BalancedMix methods by mixing the samples from the noisy and the clean label data. In experiments on the ISIC-18 public skin lesion diagnosis dataset, the proposed TTA cross-entropy outperformed the conventional cross-entropy and the TTA uncertainty in detecting label noise data in the label noise selection process. Moreover, the proposed NoiseMix not only outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in the classification performance but also showed the most robustness to the label noise in the classifier learning."
2212.00564,Leveraging Single-View Images for Unsupervised 3D Point Cloud Completion,"Point clouds captured by scanning devices are often incomplete due to occlusion. To overcome this limitation, point cloud completion methods have been developed to predict the complete shape of an object based on its partial input. These methods can be broadly classified as supervised or unsupervised. However, both categories require a large number of 3D complete point clouds, which may be difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose Cross-PCC, an unsupervised point cloud completion method without requiring any 3D complete point clouds. We only utilize 2D images of the complete objects, which are easier to capture than 3D complete and clean point clouds. Specifically, to take advantage of the complementary information from 2D images, we use a single-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a fusion module to fuse the 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point cloud. To guide the shape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted points of the object to the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its silhouette maps to constrain the position of the projected points. To reduce the outliers of the predicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to move the points projected to the background into the foreground by the single-view silhouette image. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first point cloud completion method that does not require any 3D supervision. The experimental results of our method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin. Moreover, our method even achieves comparable performance to some supervised methods. We will make the source code publicly available at https://github.com/ltwu6/cross-pcc."
2212.00621,CONDA: Continual Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Learning in Visual   Perception for Self-Driving Cars,"Although unsupervised domain adaptation methods have achieved remarkable performance in semantic scene segmentation in visual perception for self-driving cars, these approaches remain impractical in real-world use cases. In practice, the segmentation models may encounter new data that have not been seen yet. Also, the previous data training of segmentation models may be inaccessible due to privacy problems. Therefore, to address these problems, in this work, we propose a Continual Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CONDA) approach that allows the model to continuously learn and adapt with respect to the presence of the new data. Moreover, our proposed approach is designed without the requirement of accessing previous training data. To avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem and maintain the performance of the segmentation models, we present a novel Bijective Maximum Likelihood loss to impose the constraint of predicted segmentation distribution shifts. The experimental results on the benchmark of continual unsupervised domain adaptation have shown the advanced performance of the proposed CONDA method."
2212.00731,FuRPE: Learning Full-body Reconstruction from Part Experts,"In the field of full-body reconstruction, the scarcity of annotated data often impedes the efficacy of prevailing methods. To address this issue, we introduce FuRPE, a novel framework that employs part-experts and an ingenious pseudo ground-truth selection scheme to derive high-quality pseudo labels. These labels, central to our approach, equip our network with the capability to efficiently learn from the available data. Integral to FuRPE is a unique exponential moving average training strategy and expert-derived feature distillation strategy. These novel elements of FuRPE not only serve to further refine the model but also to reduce potential biases that may arise from inaccuracies in pseudo labels, thereby optimizing the network's training process and enhancing the robustness of the model. We apply FuRPE to train both two-stage and fully convolutional single-stage full-body reconstruction networks. Our exhaustive experiments on numerous benchmark datasets illustrate a substantial performance boost over existing methods, underscoring FuRPE's potential to reshape the state-of-the-art in full-body reconstruction."
2212.00749,Multimodal Query-guided Object Localization,"Consider a scenario in one-shot query-guided object localization where neither an image of the object nor the object category name is available as a query. In such a scenario, a hand-drawn sketch of the object could be a choice for a query. However, hand-drawn crude sketches alone, when used as queries, might be ambiguous for object localization, e.g., a sketch of a laptop could be confused for a sofa. On the other hand, a linguistic definition of the category, e.g., a small portable computer small enough to use in your lap"" along with the sketch query, gives better visual and semantic cues for object localization. In this work, we present a multimodal query-guided object localization approach under the challenging open-set setting. In particular, we use queries from two modalities, namely, hand-drawn sketch and description of the object (also known as gloss), to perform object localization. Multimodal query-guided object localization is a challenging task, especially when a large domain gap exists between the queries and the natural images, as well as due to the challenge of combining the complementary and minimal information present across the queries. For example, hand-drawn crude sketches contain abstract shape information of an object, while the text descriptions often capture partial semantic information about a given object category. To address the aforementioned challenges, we present a novel cross-modal attention scheme that guides the region proposal network to generate object proposals relevant to the input queries and a novel orthogonal projection-based proposal scoring technique that scores each proposal with respect to the queries, thereby yielding the final localization results. ..."
2212.00773,FakeOut: Leveraging Out-of-domain Self-supervision for Multi-modal Video   Deepfake Detection,"Video synthesis methods rapidly improved in recent years, allowing easy creation of synthetic humans. This poses a problem, especially in the era of social media, as synthetic videos of speaking humans can be used to spread misinformation in a convincing manner. Thus, there is a pressing need for accurate and robust deepfake detection methods, that can detect forgery techniques not seen during training. In this work, we explore whether this can be done by leveraging a multi-modal, out-of-domain backbone trained in a self-supervised manner, adapted to the video deepfake domain. We propose FakeOut; a novel approach that relies on multi-modal data throughout both the pre-training phase and the adaption phase. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of FakeOut in detecting various types of deepfakes, especially manipulations which were not seen during training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in cross-dataset generalization on audio-visual datasets. This study shows that, perhaps surprisingly, training on out-of-domain videos (i.e., not especially featuring speaking humans), can lead to better deepfake detection systems. Code is available on GitHub."
2212.00787,Multi-Class Segmentation from Aerial Views using Recursive Noise   Diffusion,"Semantic segmentation from aerial views is a crucial task for autonomous drones, as they rely on precise and accurate segmentation to navigate safely and efficiently. However, aerial images present unique challenges such as diverse viewpoints, extreme scale variations, and high scene complexity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-class semantic segmentation diffusion model that addresses these challenges. We introduce recursive denoising to allow information to propagate through the denoising process, as well as a hierarchical multi-scale approach that complements the diffusion process. Our method achieves promising results on the UAVid dataset and state-of-the-art performance on the Vaihingen Building segmentation benchmark. Being the first iteration of this method, it shows great promise for future improvements."
2212.00789,An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection,"Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively."
2212.01426,Learning a Pedestrian Social Behavior Dictionary,"Understanding pedestrian behavior patterns is a key component to building autonomous agents that can navigate among humans. We seek a learned dictionary of pedestrian behavior to obtain a semantic description of pedestrian trajectories. Supervised methods for dictionary learning are impractical since pedestrian behaviors may be unknown a priori and the process of manually generating behavior labels is prohibitively time consuming. We instead utilize a novel, unsupervised framework to create a taxonomy of pedestrian behavior observed in a specific space. First, we learn a trajectory latent space that enables unsupervised clustering to create an interpretable pedestrian behavior dictionary. We show the utility of this dictionary for building pedestrian behavior maps to visualize space usage patterns and for computing the distributions of behaviors. We demonstrate a simple but effective trajectory prediction by conditioning on these behavior labels. While many trajectory analysis methods rely on RNNs or transformers, we develop a lightweight, low-parameter approach and show results comparable to SOTA on the ETH and UCY datasets."
2212.01596,Average degree of the essential variety,"The essential variety is an algebraic subvariety of dimension $5$ in real projective space $\mathbb R\mathrm P^{8}$ which encodes the relative pose of two calibrated pinhole cameras. The $5$-point algorithm in computer vision computes the real points in the intersection of the essential variety with a linear space of codimension $5$. The degree of the essential variety is $10$, so this intersection consists of 10 complex points in general.   We compute the expected number of real intersection points when the linear space is random. We focus on two probability distributions for linear spaces. The first distribution is invariant under the action of the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(9)$ acting on linear spaces in $\mathbb R\mathrm P^{8}$. In this case, the expected number of real intersection points is equal to $4$. The second distribution is motivated from computer vision and is defined by choosing 5 point correspondences in the image planes $\mathbb R\mathrm P^2\times \mathbb R\mathrm P^2$ uniformly at random. A Monte Carlo computation suggests that with high probability the expected value lies in the interval $(3.95 - 0.05,\ 3.95 + 0.05)$."
2212.01742,Lightweight Facial Attractiveness Prediction Using Dual Label   Distribution,"Facial attractiveness prediction (FAP) aims to assess facial attractiveness automatically based on human aesthetic perception. Previous methods using deep convolutional neural networks have improved the performance, but their large-scale models have led to a deficiency in flexibility. In addition, most methods fail to take full advantage of the dataset. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end FAP approach that integrates dual label distribution and lightweight design. The manual ratings, attractiveness score, and standard deviation are aggregated explicitly to construct a dual-label distribution to make the best use of the dataset, including the attractiveness distribution and the rating distribution. Such distributions, as well as the attractiveness score, are optimized under a joint learning framework based on the label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm. The data processing is simplified to a minimum for a lightweight design, and MobileNetV2 is selected as our backbone. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, where our approach achieves promising results and succeeds in balancing performance and efficiency. Ablation studies demonstrate that our delicately designed learning modules are indispensable and correlated. Additionally, the visualization indicates that our approach can perceive facial attractiveness and capture attractive facial regions to facilitate semantic predictions. The code is available at https://github.com/enquan/2D_FAP."
2212.01764,Synthesize Boundaries: A Boundary-aware Self-consistent Framework for   Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection,"Fully supervised salient object detection (SOD) has made considerable progress based on expensive and time-consuming data with pixel-wise annotations. Recently, to relieve the labeling burden while maintaining performance, some scribble-based SOD methods have been proposed. However, learning precise boundary details from scribble annotations that lack edge information is still difficult. In this paper, we propose to learn precise boundaries from our designed synthetic images and labels without introducing any extra auxiliary data. The synthetic image creates boundary information by inserting synthetic concave regions that simulate the real concave regions of salient objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-consistent framework that consists of a global integral branch (GIB) and a boundary-aware branch (BAB) to train a saliency detector. GIB aims to identify integral salient objects, whose input is the original image. BAB aims to help predict accurate boundaries, whose input is the synthetic image. These two branches are connected through a self-consistent loss to guide the saliency detector to predict precise boundaries while identifying salient objects. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised SOD methods and further narrows the gap with the fully supervised methods."
2212.01959,INGeo: Accelerating Instant Neural Scene Reconstruction with Noisy   Geometry Priors,"We present a method that accelerates reconstruction of 3D scenes and objects, aiming to enable instant reconstruction on edge devices such as mobile phones and AR/VR headsets. While recent works have accelerated scene reconstruction training to minute/second-level on high-end GPUs, there is still a large gap to the goal of instant training on edge devices which is yet highly desired in many emerging applications such as immersive AR/VR. To this end, this work aims to further accelerate training by leveraging geometry priors of the target scene. Our method proposes strategies to alleviate the noise of the imperfect geometry priors to accelerate the training speed on top of the highly optimized Instant-NGP. On the NeRF Synthetic dataset, our work uses half of the training iterations to reach an average test PSNR of >30."
2212.02014,Med-Query: Steerable Parsing of 9-DoF Medical Anatomies with Query   Embedding,"Automatic parsing of human anatomies at the instance-level from 3D computed tomography (CT) is a prerequisite step for many clinical applications. The presence of pathologies, broken structures or limited field-of-view (FOV) can all make anatomy parsing algorithms vulnerable. In this work, we explore how to leverage and implement the successful detection-then-segmentation paradigm for 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing framework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT scans. Considering the complicated shapes, sizes, and orientations of anatomies, without loss of generality, we present a nine degrees of freedom (9-DoF) pose estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage, non-hierarchical representation. Our whole framework is executed in a steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to further boost inference efficiency. We have validated our method on three medical imaging parsing tasks: ribs, spine, and abdominal organs. For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs. Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of 97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%), compared favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and nnU-Net). For spine parsing and abdominal multi-organ segmentation, our method achieves competitive results on par with state-of-the-art methods on the public CTSpine1K dataset and FLARE22 competition, respectively. Our annotations, code, and models are available at: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Med_Query."
2212.02096,FBLNet: FeedBack Loop Network for Driver Attention Prediction,"The problem of predicting driver attention from the driving perspective is gaining increasing research focus due to its remarkable significance for autonomous driving and assisted driving systems. The driving experience is extremely important for safe driving,a skilled driver is able to effortlessly predict oncoming danger (before it becomes salient) based on the driving experience and quickly pay attention to the corresponding zones. However, the nonobjective driving experience is difficult to model, so a mechanism simulating the driver experience accumulation procedure is absent in existing methods, and the current methods usually follow the technique line of saliency prediction methods to predict driver attention. In this paper, we propose a FeedBack Loop Network (FBLNet), which attempts to model the driving experience accumulation procedure. By over-and-over iterations, FBLNet generates the incremental knowledge that carries rich historically-accumulative and long-term temporal information. The incremental knowledge in our model is like the driving experience of humans. Under the guidance of the incremental knowledge, our model fuses the CNN feature and Transformer feature that are extracted from the input image to predict driver attention. Our model exhibits a solid advantage over existing methods, achieving an outstanding performance improvement on two driver attention benchmark datasets."
2212.02190,L2SR: Learning to Sample and Reconstruct for Accelerated MRI via   Reinforcement Learning,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging technique, but its long acquisition time can be a limiting factor in clinical settings. To address this issue, researchers have been exploring ways to reduce the acquisition time while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Previous works have focused on finding either sparse samplers with a fixed reconstructor or finding reconstructors with a fixed sampler. However, these approaches do not fully utilize the potential of joint learning of samplers and reconstructors. In this paper, we propose an alternating training framework for jointly learning a good pair of samplers and reconstructors via deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we consider the process of MRI sampling as a sampling trajectory controlled by a sampler, and introduce a novel sparse-reward Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to formulate the MRI sampling trajectory. Compared to the dense-reward POMDP used in existing works, the proposed sparse-reward POMDP is more computationally efficient and has a provable advantage. Moreover, the proposed framework, called L2SR (Learning to Sample and Reconstruct), overcomes the training mismatch problem that arises in previous methods that use dense-reward POMDP. By alternately updating samplers and reconstructors, L2SR learns a pair of samplers and reconstructors that achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performances on the fastMRI dataset. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/yangpuPKU/L2SR-Learning-to-Sample-and-Reconstruct}."
2212.02280,DARF: Depth-Aware Generalizable Neural Radiance Field,"Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has revolutionized novel-view rendering tasks and achieved impressive results. However, the inefficient sampling and per-scene optimization hinder its wide applications. Though some generalizable NeRFs have been proposed, the rendering quality is unsatisfactory due to the lack of geometry and scene uniqueness. To address these issues, we propose the Depth-Aware Generalizable Neural Radiance Field (DARF) with a Depth-Aware Dynamic Sampling (DADS) strategy to perform efficient novel view rendering and unsupervised depth estimation on unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. Distinct from most existing generalizable NeRFs, our framework infers the unseen scenes on both pixel level and geometry level with only a few input images. By introducing a pre-trained depth estimation module to derive the depth prior, narrowing down the ray sampling interval to the proximity space of the estimated surface, and sampling in expectation maximum position, we preserve scene characteristics while learning common attributes for novel-view synthesis. Moreover, we introduce a Multi-level Semantic Consistency loss (MSC) to assist with more informative representation learning. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art generalizable NeRF methods, DARF reduces samples by 50%, while improving rendering quality and depth estimation. Our code is available on https://github.com/shiyue001/GARF.git."
2212.02340,CBNet: A Plug-and-Play Network for Segmentation-Based Scene Text   Detection,"Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text detection, which mainly contain two steps: text kernel segmentation and expansion. However, the segmentation process only considers each pixel independently, and the expansion process is difficult to achieve a favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and Boundary-guided Network (CBN) to tackle these problems. In CBN, a basic text detector is firstly used to predict initial segmentation results. Then, we propose a context-aware module to enhance text kernel feature representations, which considers both global and local contexts. Finally, we introduce a boundary-guided module to expand enhanced text kernels adaptively with only the pixels on the contours, which not only obtains accurate text boundaries but also keeps high speed, especially on high-resolution output maps. In particular, with a lightweight backbone, the basic detector equipped with our proposed CBN achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks, and our proposed CBN can be plugged into several segmentation-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/XiiZhao/cbn.pytorch."
2212.02477,Malaria Parasitic Detection using a New Deep Boosted and Ensemble   Learning Framework,"Malaria is a potentially fatal plasmodium parasite injected by female anopheles mosquitoes that infect red blood cells and millions worldwide yearly. However, specialists' manual screening in clinical practice is laborious and prone to error. Therefore, a novel Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DBEL) framework, comprising the stacking of new Boosted-BR-STM convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the ensemble ML classifiers, is developed to screen malaria parasite images. The proposed Boosted-BR-STM is based on a new dilated-convolutional block-based split transform merge (STM) and feature-map Squeezing-Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and boundary operations to learn the malaria parasite's homogeneity, heterogeneity, and boundary with patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are attained by employing Transfer Learning-based new feature-map SB in STM blocks at the abstract, medium, and conclusion levels to learn minute intensity and texture variation of the parasitic pattern. The proposed DBEL framework implicates the stacking of prominent and diverse boosted channels and provides the generated discriminative features of the developed Boosted-BR-STM to the ensemble of ML classifiers. The proposed framework improves the discrimination ability and generalization of ensemble learning. Moreover, the deep feature spaces of the developed Boosted-BR-STM and customized CNNs are fed into ML classifiers for comparative analysis. The proposed DBEL framework outperforms the existing techniques on the NIH malaria dataset that are enhanced using discrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework achieved Accuracy (98.50%), Sensitivity (0.9920), F-score (0.9850), and AUC (0.997), which suggest it to be utilized for malaria parasite screening."
2212.02506,This changes to that : Combining causal and non-causal explanations to   generate disease progression in capsule endoscopy,"Due to the unequivocal need for understanding the decision processes of deep learning networks, both modal-dependent and model-agnostic techniques have become very popular. Although both of these ideas provide transparency for automated decision making, most methodologies focus on either using the modal-gradients (model-dependent) or ignoring the model internal states and reasoning with a model's behavior/outcome (model-agnostic) to instances. In this work, we propose a unified explanation approach that given an instance combines both model-dependent and agnostic explanations to produce an explanation set. The generated explanations are not only consistent in the neighborhood of a sample but can highlight causal relationships between image content and the outcome. We use Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) domain to illustrate the effectiveness of our explanations. The saliency maps generated by our approach are comparable or better on the softmax information score."
2212.02687,Vision Transformer Computation and Resilience for Dynamic Inference,"State-of-the-art deep learning models for computer vision tasks are based on the transformer architecture and often deployed in real-time applications. In this scenario, the resources available for every inference can vary, so it is useful to be able to dynamically adapt execution to trade accuracy for efficiency. To create dynamic models, we leverage the resilience of vision transformers to pruning and switch between different scaled versions of a model. Surprisingly, we find that most FLOPs are generated by convolutions, not attention. These relative FLOP counts are not a good predictor of GPU performance since GPUs have special optimizations for convolutions. Some models are fairly resilient and their model execution can be adapted without retraining, while all models achieve better accuracy with retraining alternative execution paths. These insights mean that we can leverage CNN accelerators and these alternative execution paths to enable efficient and dynamic vision transformer inference. Our analysis shows that leveraging this type of dynamic execution can lead to saving 28\% of energy with a 1.4\% accuracy drop for SegFormer (63 GFLOPs), with no additional training, and 53\% of energy for ResNet-50 (4 GFLOPs) with a 3.3\% accuracy drop by switching between pretrained Once-For-All models."
2212.02757,Attention-Enhanced Cross-modal Localization Between 360 Images and Point   Clouds,"Visual localization plays an important role for intelligent robots and autonomous driving, especially when the accuracy of GNSS is unreliable. Recently, camera localization in LiDAR maps has attracted more and more attention for its low cost and potential robustness to illumination and weather changes. However, the commonly used pinhole camera has a narrow Field-of-View, thus leading to limited information compared with the omni-directional LiDAR data. To overcome this limitation, we focus on correlating the information of 360 equirectangular images to point clouds, proposing an end-to-end learnable network to conduct cross-modal visual localization by establishing similarity in high-dimensional feature space. Inspired by the attention mechanism, we optimize the network to capture the salient feature for comparing images and point clouds. We construct several sequences containing 360 equirectangular images and corresponding point clouds based on the KITTI-360 dataset and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
2212.02991,Proximal methods for point source localisation,"Point source localisation is generally modelled as a Lasso-type problem on measures. However, optimisation methods in non-Hilbert spaces, such as the space of Radon measures, are much less developed than in Hilbert spaces. Most numerical algorithms for point source localisation are based on the Frank-Wolfe conditional gradient method, for which ad hoc convergence theory is developed. We develop extensions of proximal-type methods to spaces of measures. This includes forward-backward splitting, its inertial version, and primal-dual proximal splitting. Their convergence proofs follow standard patterns. We demonstrate their numerical efficacy."
2212.03095,Interpretation of Neural Networks is Susceptible to Universal   Adversarial Perturbations,"Interpreting neural network classifiers using gradient-based saliency maps has been extensively studied in the deep learning literature. While the existing algorithms manage to achieve satisfactory performance in application to standard image recognition datasets, recent works demonstrate the vulnerability of widely-used gradient-based interpretation schemes to norm-bounded perturbations adversarially designed for every individual input sample. However, such adversarial perturbations are commonly designed using the knowledge of an input sample, and hence perform sub-optimally in application to an unknown or constantly changing data point. In this paper, we show the existence of a Universal Perturbation for Interpretation (UPI) for standard image datasets, which can alter a gradient-based feature map of neural networks over a significant fraction of test samples. To design such a UPI, we propose a gradient-based optimization method as well as a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach to compute a UPI which can effectively alter a neural network's gradient-based interpretation on different samples. We support the proposed UPI approaches by presenting several numerical results of their successful applications to standard image datasets."
2212.03338,Framework-agnostic Semantically-aware Global Reasoning for Segmentation,"Recent advances in pixel-level tasks (e.g. segmentation) illustrate the benefit of of long-range interactions between aggregated region-based representations that can enhance local features. However, such aggregated representations, often in the form of attention, fail to model the underlying semantics of the scene (e.g. individual objects and, by extension, their interactions). In this work, we address the issue by proposing a component that learns to project image features into latent representations and reason between them using a transformer encoder to generate contextualized and scene-consistent representations which are fused with original image features. Our design encourages the latent regions to represent semantic concepts by ensuring that the activated regions are spatially disjoint and the union of such regions corresponds to a connected object segment. The proposed semantic global reasoning (SGR) component is end-to-end trainable and can be easily added to a wide variety of backbones (CNN or transformer-based) and segmentation heads (per-pixel or mask classification) to consistently improve the segmentation results on different datasets. In addition, our latent tokens are semantically interpretable and diverse and provide a rich set of features that can be transferred to downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, with improved performance. Furthermore, we also proposed metrics to quantify the semantics of latent tokens at both class \& instance level."
2212.03836,PaDPaF: Partial Disentanglement with Partially-Federated GANs,"Federated learning has become a popular machine learning paradigm with many potential real-life applications, including recommendation systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and self-driving cars. Though most current applications focus on classification-based tasks, learning personalized generative models remains largely unexplored, and their benefits in the heterogeneous setting still need to be better understood. This work proposes a novel architecture combining global client-agnostic and local client-specific generative models. We show that using standard techniques for training federated models, our proposed model achieves privacy and personalization by implicitly disentangling the globally consistent representation (i.e. content) from the client-dependent variations (i.e. style). Using such decomposition, personalized models can generate locally unseen labels while preserving the given style of the client and can predict the labels for all clients with high accuracy by training a simple linear classifier on the global content features. Furthermore, disentanglement enables other essential applications, such as data anonymization, by sharing only the content. Extensive experimental evaluation corroborates our findings, and we also discuss a theoretical motivation for the proposed approach."
2212.04119,DialogCC: An Automated Pipeline for Creating High-Quality Multi-Modal   Dialogue Dataset,"As sharing images in an instant message is a crucial factor, there has been active research on learning an image-text multi-modal dialogue models. However, training a well-generalized multi-modal dialogue model remains challenging due to the low quality and limited diversity of images per dialogue in existing multi-modal dialogue datasets. In this paper, we propose an automated pipeline to construct a multi-modal dialogue dataset, ensuring both dialogue quality and image diversity without requiring minimum human effort. In our pipeline, to guarantee the coherence between images and dialogue, we prompt GPT-4 to infer potential image-sharing moments - specifically, the utterance, speaker, rationale, and image description. Furthermore, we leverage CLIP similarity to maintain consistency between aligned multiple images to the utterance. Through this pipeline, we introduce DialogCC, a high-quality and diverse multi-modal dialogue dataset that surpasses existing datasets in terms of quality and diversity in human evaluation. Our comprehensive experiments highlight that when multi-modal dialogue models are trained using our dataset, their generalization performance on unseen dialogue datasets is significantly enhanced. We make our source code and dataset publicly available."
2212.04227,Self-training via Metric Learning for Source-Free Domain Adaptation of   Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised source-free domain adaptation methods aim to train a model for the target domain utilizing a pretrained source-domain model and unlabeled target-domain data, particularly when accessibility to source data is restricted due to intellectual property or privacy concerns. Traditional methods usually use self-training with pseudo-labeling, which is often subjected to thresholding based on prediction confidence. However, such thresholding limits the effectiveness of self-training due to insufficient supervision. This issue becomes more severe in a source-free setting, where supervision comes solely from the predictions of the pre-trained source model. In this study, we propose a novel approach by incorporating a mean-teacher model, wherein the student network is trained using all predictions from the teacher network. Instead of employing thresholding on predictions, we introduce a method to weight the gradients calculated from pseudo-labels based on the reliability of the teacher's predictions. To assess reliability, we introduce a novel approach using proxy-based metric learning. Our method is evaluated in synthetic-to-real and cross-city scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."
2212.04489,SINE: SINgle Image Editing with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Recent works on diffusion models have demonstrated a strong capability for conditioning image generation, e.g., text-guided image synthesis. Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation. The code is available for research purposes at https://github.com/zhang-zx/SINE.git ."
2212.04492,Few-View Object Reconstruction with Unknown Categories and Camera Poses,"While object reconstruction has made great strides in recent years, current methods typically require densely captured images and/or known camera poses, and generalize poorly to novel object categories. To step toward object reconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general real-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object categories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems -- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Our approach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose estimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate reconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views and facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from each view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish cross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D features are then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fused into a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volume rendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape ground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects from five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by a large margin. The reconstruction results under predicted poses are comparable to the ones using ground-truth poses. The performance on novel testing categories matches the results on categories seen during training. Project page: https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/FORGE/"
2212.04497,UNETR++: Delving into Efficient and Accurate 3D Medical Image   Segmentation,"Owing to the success of transformer models, recent works study their applicability in 3D medical segmentation tasks. Within the transformer models, the self-attention mechanism is one of the main building blocks that strives to capture long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention operation has quadratic complexity which proves to be a computational bottleneck, especially in volumetric medical imaging, where the inputs are 3D with numerous slices. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++, that offers both high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms of parameters, compute cost, and inference speed. The core of our design is the introduction of a novel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently learns spatial and channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of inter-dependent branches based on spatial and channel attention. Our spatial attention formulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the input sequence length. To enable communication between spatial and channel-focused branches, we share the weights of query and key mapping functions that provide a complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also reducing the overall network parameters. Our extensive evaluations on five benchmarks, Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, BRaTs, and Decathlon-Lung, reveal the effectiveness of our contributions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. On Synapse, our UNETR++ sets a new state-of-the-art with a Dice Score of 87.2%, while being significantly efficient with a reduction of over 71% in terms of both parameters and FLOPs, compared to the best method in the literature. Code: https://github.com/Amshaker/unetr_plus_plus."
2212.04582,Towards Holistic Surgical Scene Understanding,"Most benchmarks for studying surgical interventions focus on a specific challenge instead of leveraging the intrinsic complementarity among different tasks. In this work, we present a new experimental framework towards holistic surgical scene understanding. First, we introduce the Phase, Step, Instrument, and Atomic Visual Action recognition (PSI-AVA) Dataset. PSI-AVA includes annotations for both long-term (Phase and Step recognition) and short-term reasoning (Instrument detection and novel Atomic Action recognition) in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy videos. Second, we present Transformers for Action, Phase, Instrument, and steps Recognition (TAPIR) as a strong baseline for surgical scene understanding. TAPIR leverages our dataset's multi-level annotations as it benefits from the learned representation on the instrument detection task to improve its classification capacity. Our experimental results in both PSI-AVA and other publicly available databases demonstrate the adequacy of our framework to spur future research on holistic surgical scene understanding."
2212.04681,Dynamic Test-Time Augmentation via Differentiable Functions,"Distribution shifts, which often occur in the real world, degrade the accuracy of deep learning systems, and thus improving robustness to distribution shifts is essential for practical applications. To improve robustness, we study an image enhancement method that generates recognition-friendly images without retraining the recognition model. We propose a novel image enhancement method, DynTTA, which is based on differentiable data augmentation techniques and generates a blended image from many augmented images to improve the recognition accuracy under distribution shifts. In addition to standard data augmentations, DynTTA also incorporates deep neural network-based image transformation, further improving the robustness. Because DynTTA is composed of differentiable functions, it can be directly trained with the classification loss of the recognition model. In experiments with widely used image recognition datasets using various classification models, DynTTA improves the robustness with almost no reduction in classification accuracy for clean images, thus outperforming the existing methods. Furthermore, the results show that robustness is significantly improved by estimating the training-time augmentations for distribution-shifted datasets using DynTTA and retraining the recognition model with the estimated augmentations. DynTTA is a promising approach for applications that require both clean accuracy and robustness. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/s-enmt/DynTTA}."
2212.04687,"Selective Amnesia: On Efficient, High-Fidelity and Blind Suppression of   Backdoor Effects in Trojaned Machine Learning Models","In this paper, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective technique to induce ""selective amnesia"" on a backdoored model. Our approach, called SEAM, has been inspired by the problem of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a long standing issue in continual learning. Our idea is to retrain a given DNN model on randomly labeled clean data, to induce a CF on the model, leading to a sudden forget on both primary and backdoor tasks; then we recover the primary task by retraining the randomized model on correctly labeled clean data. We analyzed SEAM by modeling the unlearning process as continual learning and further approximating a DNN using Neural Tangent Kernel for measuring CF. Our analysis shows that our random-labeling approach actually maximizes the CF on an unknown backdoor in the absence of triggered inputs, and also preserves some feature extraction in the network to enable a fast revival of the primary task. We further evaluated SEAM on both image processing and Natural Language Processing tasks, under both data contamination and training manipulation attacks, over thousands of models either trained on popular image datasets or provided by the TrojAI competition. Our experiments show that SEAM vastly outperforms the state-of-the-art unlearning techniques, achieving a high Fidelity (measuring the gap between the accuracy of the primary task and that of the backdoor) within a few minutes (about 30 times faster than training a model from scratch using the MNIST dataset), with only a small amount of clean data (0.1% of training data for TrojAI models)."
2212.04740,Predicting Shape Development: a Riemannian Method,"Predicting the future development of an anatomical shape from a single baseline observation is a challenging task. But it can be essential for clinical decision-making. Research has shown that it should be tackled in curved shape spaces, as (e.g., disease-related) shape changes frequently expose nonlinear characteristics. We thus propose a novel prediction method that encodes the whole shape in a Riemannian shape space. It then learns a simple prediction technique founded on hierarchical statistical modeling of longitudinal training data. When applied to predict the future development of the shape of the right hippocampus under Alzheimer's disease and to human body motion, it outperforms deep learning-supported variants as well as state-of-the-art."
2212.04745,SLAM for Visually Impaired People: a Survey,"In recent decades, several assistive technologies have been developed to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired (BVI) individuals to navigate independently and safely. At the same time, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques have become sufficiently robust and efficient to be adopted in developing these assistive technologies. We present the first systematic literature review of 54 recent studies on SLAM-based solutions for blind and visually impaired people, focusing on literature published from 2017 onward. This review explores various localization and mapping techniques employed in this context. We systematically identified and categorized diverse SLAM approaches and analyzed their localization and mapping techniques, sensor types, computing resources, and machine-learning methods. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these techniques for blind and visually impaired navigation. Moreover, we examine the major challenges described across studies, including practical challenges and considerations that affect usability and adoption. Our analysis also evaluates the effectiveness of these SLAM-based solutions in real-world scenarios and user satisfaction, providing insights into their practical impact on BVI mobility. The insights derived from this review identify critical gaps and opportunities for future research activities, particularly in addressing the challenges presented by dynamic and complex environments. We explain how SLAM technology offers the potential to improve the ability of visually impaired individuals to navigate effectively. Finally, we present future opportunities and challenges in this domain."
2212.04873,Multimodal Prototype-Enhanced Network for Few-Shot Action Recognition,"Current methods for few-shot action recognition mainly fall into the metric learning framework following ProtoNet, which demonstrates the importance of prototypes. Although they achieve relatively good performance, the effect of multimodal information is ignored, e.g. label texts. In this work, we propose a novel MultimOdal PRototype-ENhanced Network (MORN), which uses the semantic information of label texts as multimodal information to enhance prototypes. A CLIP visual encoder and a frozen CLIP text encoder are introduced to obtain features with good multimodal initialization. Then in the visual flow, visual prototypes are computed by a visual prototype-computed module. In the text flow, a semantic-enhanced (SE) module and an inflating operation are used to obtain text prototypes. The final multimodal prototypes are then computed by a multimodal prototype-enhanced (MPE) module. Besides, we define a PRototype SImilarity DiffErence (PRIDE) to evaluate the quality of prototypes, which is used to verify our improvement on the prototype level and effectiveness of MORN. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular few-shot action recognition datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics and SSv2, and MORN achieves state-of-the-art results. When plugging PRIDE into the training stage, the performance can be further improved."
2212.04965,Seeing a Rose in Five Thousand Ways,"What is a rose, visually? A rose comprises its intrinsics, including the distribution of geometry, texture, and material specific to its object category. With knowledge of these intrinsic properties, we may render roses of different sizes and shapes, in different poses, and under different lighting conditions. In this work, we build a generative model that learns to capture such object intrinsics from a single image, such as a photo of a bouquet. Such an image includes multiple instances of an object type. These instances all share the same intrinsics, but appear different due to a combination of variance within these intrinsics and differences in extrinsic factors, such as pose and illumination. Experiments show that our model successfully learns object intrinsics (distribution of geometry, texture, and material) for a wide range of objects, each from a single Internet image. Our method achieves superior results on multiple downstream tasks, including intrinsic image decomposition, shape and image generation, view synthesis, and relighting."
2212.04981,LoopDraw: a Loop-Based Autoregressive Model for Shape Synthesis and   Editing,"There is no settled universal 3D representation for geometry with many alternatives such as point clouds, meshes, implicit functions, and voxels to name a few. In this work, we present a new, compelling alternative for representing shapes using a sequence of cross-sectional closed loops. The loops across all planes form an organizational hierarchy which we leverage for autoregressive shape synthesis and editing. Loops are a non-local description of the underlying shape, as simple loop manipulations (such as shifts) result in significant structural changes to the geometry. This is in contrast to manipulating local primitives such as points in a point cloud or a triangle in a triangle mesh. We further demonstrate that loops are intuitive and natural primitive for analyzing and editing shapes, both computationally and for users."
2212.05005,Memories are One-to-Many Mapping Alleviators in Talking Face Generation,"Talking face generation aims at generating photo-realistic video portraits of a target person driven by input audio. Due to its nature of one-to-many mapping from the input audio to the output video (e.g., one speech content may have multiple feasible visual appearances), learning a deterministic mapping like previous works brings ambiguity during training, and thus causes inferior visual results. Although this one-to-many mapping could be alleviated in part by a two-stage framework (i.e., an audio-to-expression model followed by a neural-rendering model), it is still insufficient since the prediction is produced without enough information (e.g., emotions, wrinkles, etc.). In this paper, we propose MemFace to complement the missing information with an implicit memory and an explicit memory that follow the sense of the two stages respectively. More specifically, the implicit memory is employed in the audio-to-expression model to capture high-level semantics in the audio-expression shared space, while the explicit memory is employed in the neural-rendering model to help synthesize pixel-level details. Our experimental results show that our proposed MemFace surpasses all the state-of-the-art results across multiple scenarios consistently and significantly."
2212.05023,Mesh Neural Networks for SE(3)-Equivariant Hemodynamics Estimation on   the Artery Wall,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a valuable asset for patient-specific cardiovascular-disease diagnosis and prognosis, but its high computational demands hamper its adoption in practice. Machine-learning methods that estimate blood flow in individual patients could accelerate or replace CFD simulation to overcome these limitations. In this work, we consider the estimation of vector-valued quantities on the wall of three-dimensional geometric artery models. We employ group equivariant graph convolution in an end-to-end SE(3)-equivariant neural network that operates directly on triangular surface meshes and makes efficient use of training data. We run experiments on a large dataset of synthetic coronary arteries and find that our method estimates directional wall shear stress (WSS) with an approximation error of 7.6% and normalised mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.4% while up to two orders of magnitude faster than CFD. Furthermore, we show that our method is powerful enough to accurately predict transient, vector-valued WSS over the cardiac cycle while conditioned on a range of different inflow boundary conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method as a plugin replacement for CFD in the personalised prediction of hemodynamic vector and scalar fields."
2212.05040,Cross-Domain Synthetic-to-Real In-the-Wild Depth and Normal Estimation   for 3D Scene Understanding,"We present a cross-domain inference technique that learns from synthetic data to estimate depth and normals for in-the-wild omnidirectional 3D scenes encountered in real-world uncontrolled settings. To this end, we introduce UBotNet, an architecture that combines UNet and Bottleneck Transformer elements to predict consistent scene normals and depth. We also introduce the OmniHorizon synthetic dataset containing 24,335 omnidirectional images that represent a wide variety of outdoor environments, including buildings, streets, and diverse vegetation. This dataset is generated from expansive, lifelike virtual spaces and encompasses dynamic scene elements, such as changing lighting conditions, different times of day, pedestrians, and vehicles. Our experiments show that UBotNet achieves significantly improved accuracy in depth estimation and normal estimation compared to existing models. Lastly, we validate cross-domain synthetic-to-real depth and normal estimation on real outdoor images using UBotNet trained solely on our synthetic OmniHorizon dataset, demonstrating the potential of both the synthetic dataset and the proposed network for real-world scene understanding applications."
2212.05140,Local Neighborhood Features for 3D Classification,"With advances in deep learning model training strategies, the training of Point cloud classification methods is significantly improving. For example, PointNeXt, which adopts prominent training techniques and InvResNet layers into PointNet++, achieves over 7% improvement on the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset. However, most of these models use point coordinates features of neighborhood points mapped to higher dimensional space while ignoring the neighborhood point features computed before feeding to the network layers. In this paper, we revisit the PointNeXt model to study the usage and benefit of such neighborhood point features. We train and evaluate PointNeXt on ModelNet40 (synthetic), ScanObjectNN (real-world), and a recent large-scale, real-world grocery dataset, i.e., 3DGrocery100. In addition, we provide an additional inference strategy of weight averaging the top two checkpoints of PointNeXt to improve classification accuracy. Together with the abovementioned ideas, we gain 0.5%, 1%, 4.8%, 3.4%, and 1.6% overall accuracy on the PointNeXt model with real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN (hardest variant), 3DGrocery100's Apple10, Fruits, Vegetables, and Packages subsets, respectively. We also achieve a comparable 0.2% accuracy gain on ModelNet40."
2212.05216,Information-Preserved Blending Method for Forward-Looking Sonar   Mosaicing in Non-Ideal System Configuration,"Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) has started to gain attention in the field of near-bottom close-range underwater inspection because of its high resolution and high framerate features. Although Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms have been applied tentatively for object-searching tasks, human supervision is still indispensable, especially when involving critical areas. A clear FLS mosaic containing all suspicious information is in demand to help experts deal with tremendous perception data. However, previous work only considered that FLS is working in an ideal system configuration, which assumes an appropriate sonar imaging setup and the availability of accurate positioning data. Without those promises, the intra-frame and inter-frame artifacts will appear and degrade the quality of the final mosaic by making the information of interest invisible. In this paper, we propose a novel blending method for FLS mosaicing which can preserve interested information. A Long-Short Time Sliding Window (LST-SW) is designed to rectify the local statistics of raw sonar images. The statistics are then utilized to construct a Global Variance Map (GVM). The GVM helps to emphasize the useful information contained in images in the blending phase by classifying the informative and featureless pixels, thereby enhancing the quality of final mosaic. The method is verified using data collected in the real environment. The results show that our method can preserve more details in FLS mosaics for human inspection purposes in practice."
2212.05245,Joint Spatio-Temporal Modeling for the Semantic Change Detection in   Remote Sensing Images,"Semantic Change Detection (SCD) refers to the task of simultaneously extracting the changed areas and the semantic categories (before and after the changes) in Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). This is more meaningful than Binary Change Detection (BCD) since it enables detailed change analysis in the observed areas. Previous works established triple-branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures as the paradigm for SCD. However, it remains challenging to exploit semantic information with a limited amount of change samples. In this work, we investigate to jointly consider the spatio-temporal dependencies to improve the accuracy of SCD. First, we propose a Semantic Change Transformer (SCanFormer) to explicitly model the 'from-to' semantic transitions between the bi-temporal RSIs. Then, we introduce a semantic learning scheme to leverage the spatio-temporal constraints, which are coherent to the SCD task, to guide the learning of semantic changes. The resulting network (SCanNet) significantly outperforms the baseline method in terms of both detection of critical semantic changes and semantic consistency in the obtained bi-temporal results. It achieves the SOTA accuracy on two benchmark datasets for the SCD."
2212.05315,Mind The Edge: Refining Depth Edges in Sparsely-Supervised Monocular   Depth Estimation,"Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications. Recently, LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved remarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However, significant errors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities, i.e., depth edges, which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications that are sensitive to such inaccuracies, e.g., novel view synthesis and augmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is typically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes, encouraging the MDE model to produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first attempt to address the depth edges issue for LIDAR-supervised scenes. In this work we propose to learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised synthetic data, and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the MDE training. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, and due to the lack of depth edges GT in LIDAR-based scenes, we manually annotated subsets of the KITTI and the DDAD datasets with depth edges ground truth. We demonstrate significant gains in the accuracy of the depth edges with comparable per-pixel depth accuracy on several challenging datasets. Code and datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/liortalker/MindTheEdge}."
2212.05376,What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?,"One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations."
2212.05510,Mutimodal Ranking Optimization for Heterogeneous Face Re-identification,"Heterogeneous face re-identification, namely matching heterogeneous faces across disjoint visible light (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) cameras, has become an important problem in video surveillance application. However, the large domain discrepancy between heterogeneous NIR-VIS faces makes the performance of face re-identification degraded dramatically. To solve this problem, a multimodal fusion ranking optimization algorithm for heterogeneous face re-identification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we design a heterogeneous face translation network to obtain multimodal face pairs, including NIR-VIS/NIR-NIR/VIS-VIS face pairs, through mutual transformation between NIR-VIS faces. Secondly, we propose linear and non-linear fusion strategies to aggregate initial ranking lists of multimodal face pairs and acquire the optimized re-ranked list based on modal complementarity. The experimental results show that the proposed multimodal fusion ranking optimization algorithm can effectively utilize the complementarity and outperforms some relative methods on the SCface dataset."
2212.05758,BEV-MAE: Bird's Eye View Masked Autoencoders for Point Cloud   Pre-training in Autonomous Driving Scenarios,"Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods for autonomous driving scenarios mainly adopt the training-from-scratch paradigm. Unfortunately, this paradigm heavily relies on large-scale labeled data, whose collection can be expensive and time-consuming. Self-supervised pre-training is an effective and desirable way to alleviate this dependence on extensive annotated data. In this work, we present BEV-MAE, an efficient masked autoencoder pre-training framework for LiDAR-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a bird's eye view (BEV) guided masking strategy to guide the 3D encoder learning feature representation in a BEV perspective and avoid complex decoder design during pre-training. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable point token to maintain a consistent receptive field size of the 3D encoder with fine-tuning for masked point cloud inputs. Based on the property of outdoor point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios, i.e., the point clouds of distant objects are more sparse, we propose point density prediction to enable the 3D encoder to learn location information, which is essential for object detection. Experimental results show that BEV-MAE surpasses prior state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and achieves a favorably pre-training efficiency. Furthermore, based on TransFusion-L, BEV-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art LiDAR-based 3D object detection results, with 73.6 NDS and 69.6 mAP on the nuScenes benchmark. The source code will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/BEV-MAE"
2212.05808,Z-SSMNet: Zonal-aware Self-supervised Mesh Network for Prostate Cancer   Detection and Diagnosis with Bi-parametric MRI,"Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) has become a pivotal modality in the detection and diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Developing AI-based systems to identify csPCa using bpMRI can transform PCa management by improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, current state-of-the-art methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are limited in learning in-plane and three-dimensional spatial information from anisotropic images. Their performances also depend on the availability of large, diverse, and well-annotated bpMRI datasets. We propose a Zonal-aware Self-supervised Mesh Network (Z-SSMNet) that adaptively integrates multi-dimensional (2D/2.5D/3D) convolutions to learn dense intra-slice information and sparse inter-slice information of the anisotropic bpMRI in a balanced manner. A self-supervised learning (SSL) technique is proposed to pre-train our network using large-scale unlabeled data to learn the appearance, texture, and structure semantics of bpMRI. It aims to capture both intra-slice and inter-slice information during the pre-training stage. Furthermore, we constrained our network to focus on the zonal anatomical regions to further improve the detection and diagnosis capability of csPCa. We conducted extensive experiments on the PI-CAI dataset comprising 10000+ multi-center and multi-scanner data. Our Z-SSMNet excelled in both lesion-level detection (AP score of 0.633) and patient-level diagnosis (AUROC score of 0.881), securing the top position in the Open Development Phase of the PI-CAI challenge and maintained strong performance, achieving an AP score of 0.690 and an AUROC score of 0.909, and securing the second-place ranking in the Closed Testing Phase."
2212.05861,"Joint Counting, Detection and Re-Identification for Multi-Object   Tracking","The recent trend in 2D multiple object tracking (MOT) is jointly solving detection and tracking, where object detection and appearance feature (or motion) are learned simultaneously. Despite competitive performance, in crowded scenes, joint detection and tracking usually fail to find accurate object associations due to missed or false detections. In this paper, we jointly model counting, detection and re-identification in an end-to-end framework, named CountingMOT, tailored for crowded scenes. By imposing mutual object-count constraints between detection and counting, the CountingMOT tries to find a balance between object detection and crowd density map estimation, which can help it to recover missed detections or reject false detections. Our approach is an attempt to bridge the gap of object detection, counting, and re-Identification. This is in contrast to prior MOT methods that either ignore the crowd density and thus are prone to failure in crowded scenes,or depend on local correlations to build a graphical relationship for matching targets. The proposed MOT tracker can perform online and real-time tracking, and achieves the state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks MOT16 (MOTA of 79.7), MOT17 (MOTA of 81.3%) and MOT20 (MOTA of 78.9%)."
2212.05911,Adaptive Self-Training for Object Detection,"Deep learning has emerged as an effective solution for solving the task of object detection in images but at the cost of requiring large labeled datasets. To mitigate this cost, semi-supervised object detection methods, which consist in leveraging abundant unlabeled data, have been proposed and have already shown impressive results. However, most of these methods require linking a pseudo-label to a ground-truth object by thresholding. In previous works, this threshold value is usually determined empirically, which is time consuming, and only done for a single data distribution. When the domain, and thus the data distribution, changes, a new and costly parameter search is necessary. In this work, we introduce our method Adaptive Self-Training for Object Detection (ASTOD), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student method. ASTOD determines without cost a threshold value based directly on the ground value of the score histogram. To improve the quality of the teacher predictions, we also propose a novel pseudo-labeling procedure. We use different views of the unlabeled images during the pseudo-labeling step to reduce the number of missed predictions and thus obtain better candidate labels. Our teacher and our student are trained separately, and our method can be used in an iterative fashion by replacing the teacher by the student. On the MS-COCO dataset, our method consistently performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods that do not require a threshold parameter, and shows competitive results with methods that require a parameter sweep search. Additional experiments with respect to a supervised baseline on the DIOR dataset containing satellite images lead to similar conclusions, and prove that it is possible to adapt the score threshold automatically in self-training, regardless of the data distribution. The code is available at https:// github.com/rvandeghen/ASTOD"
2212.05922,Audiovisual Masked Autoencoders,"Can we leverage the audiovisual information already present in video to improve self-supervised representation learning? To answer this question, we study various pretraining architectures and objectives within the masked autoencoding framework, motivated by the success of similar methods in natural language and image understanding. We show that we can achieve significant improvements on audiovisual downstream classification tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on VGGSound and AudioSet. Furthermore, we can leverage our audiovisual pretraining scheme for multiple unimodal downstream tasks using a single audiovisual pretrained model. We additionally demonstrate the transferability of our representations, achieving state-of-the-art audiovisual results on Epic Kitchens without pretraining specifically for this dataset."
2212.06149,Forecasting formation of a Tropical Cyclone Using Reanalysis Data,"The tropical cyclone formation process is one of the most complex natural phenomena which is governed by various atmospheric, oceanographic, and geographic factors that varies with time and space. Despite several years of research, accurately predicting tropical cyclone formation remains a challenging task. While the existing numerical models have inherent limitations, the machine learning models fail to capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of the causal factors behind TC formation. In this study, a deep learning model has been proposed that can forecast the formation of a tropical cyclone with a lead time of up to 60 hours with high accuracy. The model uses the high-resolution reanalysis data ERA5 (ECMWF reanalysis 5th generation), and best track data IBTrACS (International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship) to forecast tropical cyclone formation in six ocean basins of the world. For 60 hours lead time the models achieve an accuracy in the range of 86.9% - 92.9% across the six ocean basins. The model takes about 5-15 minutes of training time depending on the ocean basin, and the amount of data used and can predict within seconds, thereby making it suitable for real-life usage."
2212.06218,Comparison Of Deep Object Detectors On A New Vulnerable Pedestrian   Dataset,"Pedestrian safety is one primary concern in autonomous driving. The under-representation of vulnerable groups in today's pedestrian datasets points to an urgent need for a dataset of vulnerable road users. In order to help train comprehensive models and subsequently drive research to improve the accuracy of vulnerable pedestrian identification, we first introduce a new dataset for vulnerable pedestrian detection in this paper: the BG Vulnerable Pedestrian (BGVP) dataset. The dataset includes four classes, i.e., Children Without Disability, Elderly without Disability, With Disability, and Non-Vulnerable. This dataset consists of images collected from the public domain and manually-annotated bounding boxes. In addition, on the proposed dataset, we have trained and tested five classic or state-of-the-art object detection models, i.e., YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOX, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Our results indicate that YOLOX and YOLOv4 perform the best on our dataset, YOLOv4 scoring 0.7999 and YOLOX scoring 0.7779 on the mAP 0.5 metric, while YOLOX outperforms YOLOv4 by 3.8 percent on the mAP 0.5:0.95 metric. Generally speaking, all five detectors do well predicting the With Disability class and perform poorly in the Elderly Without Disability class. YOLOX consistently outperforms all other detectors on the mAP (0.5:0.95) per class metric, obtaining 0.5644, 0.5242, 0.4781, and 0.6796 for Children Without Disability, Elderly Without Disability, Non-vulnerable, and With Disability, respectively. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/devvansh1997/BGVP."
2212.06244,PathFusion: Path-consistent Lidar-Camera Deep Feature Fusion,"Fusing 3D LiDAR features with 2D camera features is a promising technique for enhancing the accuracy of 3D detection, thanks to their complementary physical properties. While most of the existing methods focus on directly fusing camera features with raw LiDAR point clouds or shallow-level 3D features, it is observed that directly combining 2D and 3D features in deeper layers actually leads to a decrease in accuracy due to feature misalignment. The misalignment, which stems from the aggregation of features learned from large receptive fields, becomes increasingly more severe as we delve into deeper layers. In this paper, we propose PathFusion as a solution to enable the alignment of semantically coherent LiDAR-camera deep feature fusion. PathFusion introduces a path consistency loss at multiple stages within the network, encouraging the 2D backbone and its fusion path to transform 2D features in a way that aligns semantically with the transformation of the 3D backbone. This ensures semantic consistency between 2D and 3D features, even in deeper layers, and amplifies the usage of the network's learning capacity. We apply PathFusion to improve a prior-art fusion baseline, Focals Conv, and observe an improvement of over 1.6% in mAP on the nuScenes test split consistently with and without testing-time data augmentations, and moreover, PathFusion also improves KITTI $\text{AP}_{\text{3D}}$ (R11) by about 0.6% on the moderate level."
2212.06278,Efficient Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for nnU-Net,"The self-configuring nnU-Net has achieved leading performance in a large range of medical image segmentation challenges. It is widely considered as the model of choice and a strong baseline for medical image segmentation. However, despite its extraordinary performance, nnU-Net does not supply a measure of uncertainty to indicate its possible failure. This can be problematic for large-scale image segmentation applications, where data are heterogeneous and nnU-Net may fail without notice. In this work, we introduce a novel method to estimate nnU-Net uncertainty for medical image segmentation. We propose a highly effective scheme for posterior sampling of weight space for Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Different from previous baseline methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout and mean-field Bayesian Neural Networks, our proposed method does not require a variational architecture and keeps the original nnU-Net architecture intact, thereby preserving its excellent performance and ease of use. Additionally, we boost the segmentation performance over the original nnU-Net via marginalizing multi-modal posterior models. We applied our method on the public ACDC and M&M datasets of cardiac MRI and demonstrated improved uncertainty estimation over a range of baseline methods. The proposed method further strengthens nnU-Net for medical image segmentation in terms of both segmentation accuracy and quality control."
2212.06310,Structure-Guided Image Completion with Image-level and Object-level   Semantic Discriminators,"Structure-guided image completion aims to inpaint a local region of an image according to an input guidance map from users. While such a task enables many practical applications for interactive editing, existing methods often struggle to hallucinate realistic object instances in complex natural scenes. Such a limitation is partially due to the lack of semantic-level constraints inside the hole region as well as the lack of a mechanism to enforce realistic object generation. In this work, we propose a learning paradigm that consists of semantic discriminators and object-level discriminators for improving the generation of complex semantics and objects. Specifically, the semantic discriminators leverage pretrained visual features to improve the realism of the generated visual concepts. Moreover, the object-level discriminators take aligned instances as inputs to enforce the realism of individual objects. Our proposed scheme significantly improves the generation quality and achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks, including segmentation-guided completion, edge-guided manipulation and panoptically-guided manipulation on Places2 datasets. Furthermore, our trained model is flexible and can support multiple editing use cases, such as object insertion, replacement, removal and standard inpainting. In particular, our trained model combined with a novel automatic image completion pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard inpainting task."
2212.06431,Object-fabrication Targeted Attack for Object Detection,"Recent studies have demonstrated that object detection networks are usually vulnerable to adversarial examples. Generally, adversarial attacks for object detection can be categorized into targeted and untargeted attacks. Compared with untargeted attacks, targeted attacks present greater challenges and all existing targeted attack methods launch the attack by misleading detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, since these methods must depend on the presence of the detected objects within the victim image, they suffer from limitations in attack scenarios and attack success rates. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature space attack method that can mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra designated objects regardless of whether the victim image contains objects or not. Specifically, we introduce a guided image to extract coarse-grained features of the target objects and design an innovative dual attention mechanism to filter out the critical features of the target objects efficiently. The attack performance of the proposed method is evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets with FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed targeted feature space attack method shows significant improvements in terms of image-specific, universality, and generalization attack performance, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection."
2212.06512,DifFace: Blind Face Restoration with Diffused Error Contraction,"While deep learning-based methods for blind face restoration have achieved unprecedented success, they still suffer from two major limitations. First, most of them deteriorate when facing complex degradations out of their training data. Second, these methods require multiple constraints, e.g., fidelity, perceptual, and adversarial losses, which require laborious hyper-parameter tuning to stabilize and balance their influences. In this work, we propose a novel method named DifFace that is capable of coping with unseen and complex degradations more gracefully without complicated loss designs. The key of our method is to establish a posterior distribution from the observed low-quality (LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) counterpart. In particular, we design a transition distribution from the LQ image to the intermediate state of a pre-trained diffusion model and then gradually transmit from this intermediate state to the HQ target by recursively applying a pre-trained diffusion model. The transition distribution only relies on a restoration backbone that is trained with $L_2$ loss on some synthetic data, which favorably avoids the cumbersome training process in existing methods. Moreover, the transition distribution can contract the error of the restoration backbone and thus makes our method more robust to unknown degradations. Comprehensive experiments show that DifFace is superior to current state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases with severe degradations. Code and model are available at https://github.com/zsyOAOA/DifFace."
2212.06550,Body Segmentation Using Multi-task Learning,"Body segmentation is an important step in many computer vision problems involving human images and one of the key components that affects the performance of all downstream tasks. Several prior works have approached this problem using a multi-task model that exploits correlations between different tasks to improve segmentation performance. Based on the success of such solutions, we present in this paper a novel multi-task model for human segmentation/parsing that involves three tasks, i.e., (i) keypoint-based skeleton estimation, (ii) dense pose prediction, and (iii) human-body segmentation. The main idea behind the proposed Segmentation--Pose--DensePose model (or SPD for short) is to learn a better segmentation model by sharing knowledge across different, yet related tasks. SPD is based on a shared deep neural network backbone that branches off into three task-specific model heads and is learned using a multi-task optimization objective. The performance of the model is analysed through rigorous experiments on the LIP and ATR datasets and in comparison to a recent (state-of-the-art) multi-task body-segmentation model. Comprehensive ablation studies are also presented. Our experimental results show that the proposed multi-task (segmentation) model is highly competitive and that the introduction of additional tasks contributes towards a higher overall segmentation performance."
2212.06776,Unfolding Local Growth Rate Estimates for (Almost) Perfect Adversarial   Detection,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) define the state-of-the-art solution on many perceptual tasks. However, current CNN approaches largely remain vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to the human eye. In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to defend CNNs against such attacks, for example by model hardening or by adding explicit defence mechanisms. Thereby, a small ""detector"" is included in the network and trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. In this work, we propose a simple and light-weight detector, which leverages recent findings on the relation between networks' local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) and adversarial attacks. Based on a re-interpretation of the LID measure and several simple adaptations, we surpass the state-of-the-art on adversarial detection by a significant margin and reach almost perfect results in terms of F1-score for several networks and datasets.

2212.06872,Comparing the Decision-Making Mechanisms by Transformers and CNNs via   Explanation Methods,"In order to gain insights about the decision-making of different visual recognition backbones, we propose two methodologies, sub-explanation counting and cross-testing, that systematically applies deep explanation algorithms on a dataset-wide basis, and compares the statistics generated from the amount and nature of the explanations. These methodologies reveal the difference among networks in terms of two properties called compositionality and disjunctivism. Transformers and ConvNeXt are found to be more compositional, in the sense that they jointly consider multiple parts of the image in building their decisions, whereas traditional CNNs and distilled transformers are less compositional and more disjunctive, which means that they use multiple diverse but smaller set of parts to achieve a confident prediction. Through further experiments, we pinpointed the choice of normalization to be especially important in the compositionality of a model, in that batch normalization leads to less compositionality while group and layer normalization lead to more. Finally, we also analyze the features shared by different backbones and plot a landscape of different models based on their feature-use similarity."
2212.07050,Significantly improving zero-shot X-ray pathology classification via   fine-tuning pre-trained image-text encoders,"Deep neural networks are increasingly used in medical imaging for tasks such as pathological classification, but they face challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality, expert-labeled training data. Recent efforts have utilized pre-trained contrastive image-text models like CLIP, adapting them for medical use by fine-tuning the model with chest X-ray images and corresponding reports for zero-shot pathology classification, thus eliminating the need for pathology-specific annotations. However, most studies continue to use the same contrastive learning objectives as in the general domain, overlooking the multi-labeled nature of medical image-report pairs. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning strategy that includes positive-pair loss relaxation and random sentence sampling. We aim to improve the performance of zero-shot pathology classification without relying on external knowledge. Our method can be applied to any pre-trained contrastive image-text encoder and easily transferred to out-of-domain datasets without further training, as it does not use external data. Our approach consistently improves overall zero-shot pathology classification across four chest X-ray datasets and three pre-trained models, with an average macro AUROC increase of 4.3%. Additionally, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art and marginally surpasses board-certified radiologists in zero-shot classification for the five competition pathologies in the CheXpert dataset."
2212.07143,Reproducible scaling laws for contrastive language-image learning,"Scaling up neural networks has led to remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, performance often follows reliable scaling laws as a function of training set size, model size, and compute, which offers valuable guidance as large-scale experiments are becoming increasingly expensive. However, previous work on scaling laws has primarily used private data \& models or focused on uni-modal language or vision learning. To address these limitations, we investigate scaling laws for contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) with the public LAION dataset and the open-source OpenCLIP repository. Our large-scale experiments involve models trained on up to two billion image-text pairs and identify power law scaling for multiple downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, linear probing, and end-to-end fine-tuning. We find that the training distribution plays a key role in scaling laws as the OpenAI and OpenCLIP models exhibit different scaling behavior despite identical model architectures and similar training recipes. We open-source our evaluation workflow and all models, including the largest public CLIP models, to ensure reproducibility and make scaling laws research more accessible. Source code and instructions to reproduce this study will be available at https://github.com/LAION-AI/scaling-laws-openclip"
2212.07350,A Fast Geometric Regularizer to Mitigate Event Collapse in the Contrast   Maximization Framework,"Event cameras are emerging vision sensors and their advantages are suitable for various applications such as autonomous robots. Contrast maximization (CMax), which provides state-of-the-art accuracy on motion estimation using events, may suffer from an overfitting problem called event collapse. Prior works are computationally expensive or cannot alleviate the overfitting, which undermines the benefits of the CMax framework. We propose a novel, computationally efficient regularizer based on geometric principles to mitigate event collapse. The experiments show that the proposed regularizer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy results, while its reduced computational complexity makes it two to four times faster than previous approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our regularizer is the only effective solution for event collapse without trading off runtime. We hope our work opens the door for future applications that unlocks the advantages of event cameras."
2212.07495,SAIF: Sparse Adversarial and Imperceptible Attack Framework,"Adversarial attacks hamper the decision-making ability of neural networks by perturbing the input signal. The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset."
2212.07699,Retrieval-based Disentangled Representation Learning with Natural   Language Supervision,"Disentangled representation learning remains challenging as the underlying factors of variation in the data do not naturally exist. The inherent complexity of real-world data makes it unfeasible to exhaustively enumerate and encapsulate all its variations within a finite set of factors. However, it is worth noting that most real-world data have linguistic equivalents, typically in the form of textual descriptions. These linguistic counterparts can represent the data and effortlessly decomposed into distinct tokens. In light of this, we present Vocabulary Disentangled Retrieval (VDR), a retrieval-based framework that harnesses natural language as proxies of the underlying data variation to drive disentangled representation learning. Our approach employ a bi-encoder model to represent both data and natural language in a vocabulary space, enabling the model to distinguish dimensions that capture intrinsic characteristics within data through its natural language counterpart, thus facilitating disentanglement. We extensively assess the performance of VDR across 15 retrieval benchmark datasets, covering text-to-text and cross-modal retrieval scenarios, as well as human evaluation. Our experimental results compellingly demonstrate the superiority of VDR over previous bi-encoder retrievers with comparable model size and training costs, achieving an impressive 8.7% improvement in NDCG@10 on the BEIR benchmark, a 5.3% increase on MS COCO, and a 6.0% increase on Flickr30k in terms of mean recall in the zero-shot setting. Moreover, The results from human evaluation indicate that interpretability of our method is on par with SOTA captioning models."
2212.07778,Efficient Visual Computing with Camera RAW Snapshots,"Conventional cameras capture image irradiance on a sensor and convert it to RGB images using an image signal processor (ISP). The images can then be used for photography or visual computing tasks in a variety of applications, such as public safety surveillance and autonomous driving. One can argue that since RAW images contain all the captured information, the conversion of RAW to RGB using an ISP is not necessary for visual computing. In this paper, we propose a novel $\rho$-Vision framework to perform high-level semantic understanding and low-level compression using RAW images without the ISP subsystem used for decades. Considering the scarcity of available RAW image datasets, we first develop an unpaired CycleR2R network based on unsupervised CycleGAN to train modular unrolled ISP and inverse ISP (invISP) models using unpaired RAW and RGB images. We can then flexibly generate simulated RAW images (simRAW) using any existing RGB image dataset and finetune different models originally trained for the RGB domain to process real-world camera RAW images. We demonstrate object detection and image compression capabilities in RAW-domain using RAW-domain YOLOv3 and RAW image compressor (RIC) on snapshots from various cameras. Quantitative results reveal that RAW-domain task inference provides better detection accuracy and compression compared to RGB-domain processing. Furthermore, the proposed \r{ho}-Vision generalizes across various camera sensors and different task-specific models. Additional advantages of the proposed $\rho$-Vision that eliminates the ISP are the potential reductions in computations and processing times."
2212.08044,Benchmarking Robustness of Multimodal Image-Text Models under   Distribution Shift,"Multimodal image-text models have shown remarkable performance in the past few years. However, evaluating robustness against distribution shifts is crucial before adopting them in real-world applications. In this work, we investigate the robustness of 12 popular open-sourced image-text models under common perturbations on five tasks (image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, visual entailment, image captioning, and text-to-image generation). In particular, we propose several new multimodal robustness benchmarks by applying 17 image perturbation and 16 text perturbation techniques on top of existing datasets. We observe that multimodal models are not robust to image and text perturbations, especially to image perturbations. Among the tested perturbation methods, character-level perturbations constitute the most severe distribution shift for text, and zoom blur is the most severe shift for image data. We also introduce two new robustness metrics (\textbf{MMI} for MultiModal Impact score and \textbf{MOR} for Missing Object Rate) for proper evaluations of multimodal models. We hope our extensive study sheds light on new directions for the development of robust multimodal models. More details can be found on the project webpage: \url{https://MMRobustness.github.io}."
2212.08123,Bayesian posterior approximation with stochastic ensembles,"We introduce ensembles of stochastic neural networks to approximate the Bayesian posterior, combining stochastic methods such as dropout with deep ensembles. The stochastic ensembles are formulated as families of distributions and trained to approximate the Bayesian posterior with variational inference. We implement stochastic ensembles based on Monte Carlo dropout, DropConnect and a novel non-parametric version of dropout and evaluate them on a toy problem and CIFAR image classification. For both tasks, we test the quality of the posteriors directly against Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that stochastic ensembles provide more accurate posterior estimates than other popular baselines for Bayesian inference."
2212.08158,MM-SHAP: A Performance-agnostic Metric for Measuring Multimodal   Contributions in Vision and Language Models & Tasks,"Vision and language models (VL) are known to exploit unrobust indicators in individual modalities (e.g., introduced by distributional biases) instead of focusing on relevant information in each modality. That a unimodal model achieves similar accuracy on a VL task to a multimodal one, indicates that so-called unimodal collapse occurred. However, accuracy-based tests fail to detect e.g., when the model prediction is wrong, while the model used relevant information from a modality. Instead, we propose MM-SHAP, a performance-agnostic multimodality score based on Shapley values that reliably quantifies in which proportions a multimodal model uses individual modalities. We apply MM-SHAP in two ways: (1) to compare models for their average degree of multimodality, and (2) to measure for individual models the contribution of individual modalities for different tasks and datasets. Experiments with six VL models -- LXMERT, CLIP and four ALBEF variants -- on four VL tasks highlight that unimodal collapse can occur to different degrees and in different directions, contradicting the wide-spread assumption that unimodal collapse is one-sided. Based on our results, we recommend MM-SHAP for analysing multimodal tasks, to diagnose and guide progress towards multimodal integration. Code available at \url{https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/MM-SHAP}."
2212.08251,Task-Adaptive Saliency Guidance for Exemplar-free Class Incremental   Learning,"Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn tasks with access only to data from the current one. EFCIL is of interest because it mitigates concerns about privacy and long-term storage of data, while at the same time alleviating the problem of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning. In this work, we introduce task-adaptive saliency for EFCIL and propose a new framework, which we call Task-Adaptive Saliency Supervision (TASS), for mitigating the negative effects of saliency drift between different tasks. We first apply boundary-guided saliency to maintain task adaptivity and \textit{plasticity} on model attention. Besides, we introduce task-agnostic low-level signals as auxiliary supervision to increase the \textit{stability} of model attention. Finally, we introduce a module for injecting and recovering saliency noise to increase the robustness of saliency preservation. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can better preserve saliency maps across tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset EFCIL benchmarks. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/scok30/tass}."
2212.08341,Adversarial Example Defense via Perturbation Grading Strategy,"Deep Neural Networks have been widely used in many fields. However, studies have shown that DNNs are easily attacked by adversarial examples, which have tiny perturbations and greatly mislead the correct judgment of DNNs. Furthermore, even if malicious attackers cannot obtain all the underlying model parameters, they can use adversarial examples to attack various DNN-based task systems. Researchers have proposed various defense methods to protect DNNs, such as reducing the aggressiveness of adversarial examples by preprocessing or improving the robustness of the model by adding modules. However, some defense methods are only effective for small-scale examples or small perturbations but have limited defense effects for adversarial examples with large perturbations. This paper assigns different defense strategies to adversarial perturbations of different strengths by grading the perturbations on the input examples. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves defense performance. In addition, the proposed method does not modify any task model, which can be used as a preprocessing module, which significantly reduces the deployment cost in practical applications."
2212.08380,Instance-dependent Label Distribution Estimation for Learning with Label   Noise,"Noise transition matrix (NTM) estimation is a promising approach for learning with label noise. It can infer clean posterior probabilities, known as Label Distribution (LD), based on noisy ones and reduce the impact of noisy labels. However, this estimation is challenging, since the ground truth labels are not always available. Most existing methods estimate a global NTM using either correctly labeled samples (anchor points) or detected reliable samples (pseudo anchor points). These methods heavily rely on the existence of anchor points or the quality of pseudo ones, and the global NTM can hardly provide accurate label transition information for each sample, since the label noise in real applications is mostly instance-dependent. To address these challenges, we propose an Instance-dependent Label Distribution Estimation (ILDE) method to learn from noisy labels for image classification. The method's workflow has three major steps. First, we estimate each sample's noisy posterior probability, supervised by noisy labels. Second, since mislabeling probability closely correlates with inter-class correlation, we compute the inter-class correlation matrix to estimate the NTM, bypassing the need for (pseudo) anchor points. Moreover, for a precise approximation of the instance-dependent NTM, we calculate the inter-class correlation matrix using only mini-batch samples rather than the entire training dataset. Third, we transform the noisy posterior probability into instance-dependent LD by multiplying it with the estimated NTM, using the resulting LD for enhanced supervision to prevent DCNNs from memorizing noisy labels. The proposed ILDE method has been evaluated against several state-of-the-art methods on two synthetic and three real-world noisy datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed ILDE method outperforms all competing methods, no matter whether the noise is synthetic or real noise."
2212.08414,Deep Learning Methods for Calibrated Photometric Stereo and Beyond,"Photometric stereo recovers the surface normals of an object from multiple images with varying shading cues, i.e., modeling the relationship between surface orientation and intensity at each pixel. Photometric stereo prevails in superior per-pixel resolution and fine reconstruction details. However, it is a complicated problem because of the non-linear relationship caused by non-Lambertian surface reflectance. Recently, various deep learning methods have shown a powerful ability in the context of photometric stereo against non-Lambertian surfaces. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing deep learning-based calibrated photometric stereo methods. We first analyze these methods from different perspectives, including input processing, supervision, and network architecture. We summarize the performance of deep learning photometric stereo models on the most widely-used benchmark data set. This demonstrates the advanced performance of deep learning-based photometric stereo methods. Finally, we give suggestions and propose future research trends based on the limitations of existing models."
2212.08639,An annotated instance segmentation XXL-CT data-set from a historic   airplane,"The Me 163 was a Second World War fighter airplane and a result of the German air force secret developments. One of these airplanes is currently owned and displayed in the historic aircraft exhibition of the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany. To gain insights with respect to its history, design and state of preservation, a complete CT scan was obtained using an industrial XXL-computer tomography scanner. Using the CT data from the Me 163, all its details can visually be examined at various levels, ranging from the complete hull down to single sprockets and rivets. However, while a trained human observer can identify and interpret the volumetric data with all its parts and connections, a virtual dissection of the airplane and all its different parts would be quite desirable. Nevertheless, this means, that an instance segmentation of all components and objects of interest into disjoint entities from the CT data is necessary. As of currently, no adequate computer-assisted tools for automated or semi-automated segmentation of such XXL-airplane data are available, in a first step, an interactive data annotation and object labelling process has been established. So far, seven 512 x 512 x 512 voxel sub-volumes from the Me 163 airplane have been annotated and labelled, whose results can potentially be used for various new applications in the field of digital heritage, non-destructive testing, or machine-learning. This work describes the data acquisition process of the airplane using an industrial XXL-CT scanner, outlines the interactive segmentation and labelling scheme to annotate sub-volumes of the airplane's CT data, describes and discusses various challenges with respect to interpreting and handling the annotated and labelled data."
2212.08650,ColorSense: A Study on Color Vision in Machine Visual Recognition,"Color vision is essential for human visual perception, but its impact on machine perception is still underexplored. There has been an intensified demand for understanding its role in machine perception for safety-critical tasks such as assistive driving and surgery but lacking suitable datasets. To fill this gap, we curate multipurpose datasets ColorSense, by collecting 110,000 non-trivial human annotations of foreground and background color labels from popular visual recognition benchmarks. To investigate the impact of color vision on machine perception, we assign each image a color discrimination level based on its dominant foreground and background colors and use it to study the impact of color vision on machine perception. We validate the use of our datasets by demonstrating that the level of color discrimination has a dominating effect on the performance of mainstream machine perception models. Specifically, we examine the perception ability of machine vision by considering key factors such as model architecture, training objective, model size, training data, and task complexity. Furthermore, to investigate how color and environmental factors affect the robustness of visual recognition in machine perception, we integrate our ColorSense datasets with image corruptions and perform a more comprehensive visual perception evaluation. Our findings suggest that object recognition tasks such as classification and localization are susceptible to color vision bias, especially for high-stakes cases such as vehicle classes, and advanced mitigation techniques such as data augmentation and so on only give marginal improvement. Our analyses highlight the need for new approaches toward the performance evaluation of machine perception models in real-world applications. Lastly, we present various potential applications of ColorSense such as studying spurious correlations."
2212.08731,Multi-person 3D pose estimation from unlabelled data,"Its numerous applications make multi-human 3D pose estimation a remarkably impactful area of research. Nevertheless, assuming a multiple-view system composed of several regular RGB cameras, 3D multi-pose estimation presents several challenges. First of all, each person must be uniquely identified in the different views to separate the 2D information provided by the cameras. Secondly, the 3D pose estimation process from the multi-view 2D information of each person must be robust against noise and potential occlusions in the scenario. In this work, we address these two challenges with the help of deep learning. Specifically, we present a model based on Graph Neural Networks capable of predicting the cross-view correspondence of the people in the scenario along with a Multilayer Perceptron that takes the 2D points to yield the 3D poses of each person. These two models are trained in a self-supervised manner, thus avoiding the need for large datasets with 3D annotations."
2212.08896,Human Image Generation: A Comprehensive Survey,"Image and video synthesis has become a blooming topic in computer vision and machine learning communities along with the developments of deep generative models, due to its great academic and application value. Many researchers have been devoted to synthesizing high-fidelity human images as one of the most commonly seen object categories in daily lives, where a large number of studies are performed based on various models, task settings and applications. Thus, it is necessary to give a comprehensive overview on these variant methods on human image generation. In this paper, we divide human image generation techniques into three paradigms, i.e., data-driven methods, knowledge-guided methods and hybrid methods. For each paradigm, the most representative models and the corresponding variants are presented, where the advantages and characteristics of different methods are summarized in terms of model architectures. Besides, the main public human image datasets and evaluation metrics in the literature are summarized. Furthermore, due to the wide application potentials, the typical downstream usages of synthesized human images are covered. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities of human image generation are discussed to shed light on future research."
2212.08904,Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing,"Hierarchical semantic structures, naturally existing in real-world datasets, can assist in capturing the latent distribution of data to learn robust hash codes for retrieval systems. Although hierarchical semantic structures can be simply expressed by integrating semantically relevant data into a high-level taxon with coarser-grained semantics, the construction, embedding, and exploitation of the structures remain tricky for unsupervised hash learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing (HHCH). We propose to embed continuous hash codes into hyperbolic space for accurate semantic expression since embedding hierarchies in hyperbolic space generates less distortion than in hyper-sphere space and Euclidean space. In addition, we extend the K-Means algorithm to hyperbolic space and perform the proposed hierarchical hyperbolic K-Means algorithm to construct hierarchical semantic structures adaptively. To exploit the hierarchical semantic structures in hyperbolic space, we designed the hierarchical contrastive learning algorithm, including hierarchical instance-wise and hierarchical prototype-wise contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods. Codes will be released."
2212.08983,Adaptive deep learning framework for robust unsupervised underwater   image enhancement,"One of the main challenges in deep learning-based underwater image enhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data. Underwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to the distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it difficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse datasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning model with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and statistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic underwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature extractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To improve the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a statistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual consistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using a ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation and can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art results on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight publicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework yields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in quantitative as well as qualitative metrics.

2212.09100,SPARF: Large-Scale Learning of 3D Sparse Radiance Fields from Few Input   Images,"Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) treat the problem of novel view synthesis as Sparse Radiance Field (SRF) optimization using sparse voxels for efficient and fast rendering (plenoxels,InstantNGP). In order to leverage machine learning and adoption of SRFs as a 3D representation, we present SPARF, a large-scale ShapeNet-based synthetic dataset for novel view synthesis consisting of $\sim$ 17 million images rendered from nearly 40,000 shapes at high resolution (400 X 400 pixels). The dataset is orders of magnitude larger than existing synthetic datasets for novel view synthesis and includes more than one million 3D-optimized radiance fields with multiple voxel resolutions. Furthermore, we propose a novel pipeline (SuRFNet) that learns to generate sparse voxel radiance fields from only few views. This is done by using the densely collected SPARF dataset and 3D sparse convolutions. SuRFNet employs partial SRFs from few/one images and a specialized SRF loss to learn to generate high-quality sparse voxel radiance fields that can be rendered from novel views. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of unconstrained novel view synthesis based on few views on ShapeNet as compared to recent baselines. The SPARF dataset is made public with the code and models on the project website https://abdullahamdi.com/sparf/ ."
2212.09102,Face Generation and Editing with StyleGAN: A Survey,"Our goal with this survey is to provide an overview of the state of the art deep learning methods for face generation and editing using StyleGAN. The survey covers the evolution of StyleGAN, from PGGAN to StyleGAN3, and explores relevant topics such as suitable metrics for training, different latent representations, GAN inversion to latent spaces of StyleGAN, face image editing, cross-domain face stylization, face restoration, and even Deepfake applications. We aim to provide an entry point into the field for readers that have basic knowledge about the field of deep learning and are looking for an accessible introduction and overview."
2212.09129,SUCRe: Leveraging Scene Structure for Underwater Color Restoration,"Underwater images are altered by the physical characteristics of the medium through which light rays pass before reaching the optical sensor. Scattering and wavelength-dependent absorption significantly modify the captured colors depending on the distance of observed elements to the image plane. In this paper, we aim to recover an image of the scene as if the water had no effect on light propagation. We introduce SUCRe, a novel method that exploits the scene's 3D structure for underwater color restoration. By following points in multiple images and tracking their intensities at different distances to the sensor, we constrain the optimization of the parameters in an underwater image formation model and retrieve unattenuated pixel intensities. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses of our approach in a variety of scenarios ranging from natural light to deep-sea environments using three underwater datasets acquired from real-world scenarios and one synthetic dataset. We also compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a wide range of existing state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate a consistent benefit of exploiting multiple views across a spectrum of objective metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/clementinboittiaux/sucre."
2212.09298,From a Bird's Eye View to See: Joint Camera and Subject Registration   without the Camera Calibration,"We tackle a new problem of multi-view camera and subject registration in the bird's eye view (BEV) without pre-given camera calibration. This is a very challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different first-person views (FPVs) for a multi-person scene, without the BEV image and the calibration of the FPVs, while the output is a unified plane with the localization and orientation of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. We propose an end-to-end framework solving this problem, whose main idea can be divided into following parts: i) creating a view-transform subject detection module to transform the FPV to a virtual BEV including localization and orientation of each pedestrian, ii) deriving a geometric transformation based method to estimate camera localization and view direction, i.e., the camera registration in a unified BEV, iii) making use of spatial and appearance information to aggregate the subjects into the unified BEV. We collect a new large-scale synthetic dataset with rich annotations for evaluation. The experimental results show the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method."
2212.09611,Optimizing Prompts for Text-to-Image Generation,"Well-designed prompts can guide text-to-image models to generate amazing images. However, the performant prompts are often model-specific and misaligned with user input. Instead of laborious human engineering, we propose prompt adaptation, a general framework that automatically adapts original user input to model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we first perform supervised fine-tuning with a pretrained language model on a small collection of manually engineered prompts. Then we use reinforcement learning to explore better prompts. We define a reward function that encourages the policy to generate more aesthetically pleasing images while preserving the original user intentions. Experimental results on Stable Diffusion show that our method outperforms manual prompt engineering in terms of both automatic metrics and human preference ratings. Moreover, reinforcement learning further boosts performance, especially on out-of-domain prompts. The pretrained checkpoints are available at https://aka.ms/promptist. The demo can be found at https://aka.ms/promptist-demo."
2212.09877,LayoutDETR: Detection Transformer Is a Good Multimodal Layout Designer,"Graphic layout designs play an essential role in visual communication. Yet handcrafting layout designs is skill-demanding, time-consuming, and non-scalable to batch production. Generative models emerge to make design automation scalable but it remains non-trivial to produce designs that comply with designers' multimodal desires, i.e., constrained by background images and driven by foreground content. We propose LayoutDETR that inherits the high quality and realism from generative modeling, while reformulating content-aware requirements as a detection problem: we learn to detect in a background image the reasonable locations, scales, and spatial relations for multimodal foreground elements in a layout. Our solution sets a new state-of-the-art performance for layout generation on public benchmarks and on our newly-curated ad banner dataset. We integrate our solution into a graphical system that facilitates user studies, and show that users prefer our designs over baselines by significant margins. Code, models, dataset, and demos are available at https://github.com/salesforce/LayoutDETR."
2212.09977,Unified Framework for Histopathology Image Augmentation and   Classification via Generative Models,"Deep learning techniques have become widely utilized in histopathology image classification due to their superior performance. However, this success heavily relies on the availability of substantial labeled data, which necessitates extensive and costly manual annotation by domain experts. To address this challenge, researchers have recently employed generative models to synthesize data for augmentation, thereby enhancing classification model performance. Traditionally, this involves generating synthetic data first and then training the classification model with both synthetic and real data, which creates a two-stage, time-consuming workflow. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative unified framework that integrates the data generation and model training stages into a unified process. Our approach utilizes a pure Vision Transformer (ViT)-based conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) model to simultaneously handle both image synthesis and classification. An additional classification head is incorporated into the cGAN model to enable simultaneous classification of histopathology images. To improve training stability and enhance the quality of generated data, we introduce a conditional class projection technique that helps maintain class separation during the generation process. We also employ a dynamic multi-loss weighting mechanism to effectively balance the losses of the classification tasks. Furthermore, our selective augmentation mechanism actively selects the most suitable generated images for data augmentation to further improve performance. Extensive experiments on histopathology datasets show that our unified synthetic augmentation framework consistently enhances the performance of histopathology image classification models."
2212.10049,OBMO: One Bounding Box Multiple Objects for Monocular 3D Object   Detection,"Compared to typical multi-sensor systems, monocular 3D object detection has attracted much attention due to its simple configuration. However, there is still a significant gap between LiDAR-based and monocular-based methods. In this paper, we find that the ill-posed nature of monocular imagery can lead to depth ambiguity. Specifically, objects with different depths can appear with the same bounding boxes and similar visual features in the 2D image. Unfortunately, the network cannot accurately distinguish different depths from such non-discriminative visual features, resulting in unstable depth training. To facilitate depth learning, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play module, \underline{O}ne \underline{B}ounding Box \underline{M}ultiple \underline{O}bjects (OBMO). Concretely, we add a set of suitable pseudo labels by shifting the 3D bounding box along the viewing frustum. To constrain the pseudo-3D labels to be reasonable, we carefully design two label scoring strategies to represent their quality. In contrast to the original hard depth labels, such soft pseudo labels with quality scores allow the network to learn a reasonable depth range, boosting training stability and thus improving final performance. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art monocular 3D detectors by a significant margin (The improvements under the moderate setting on KITTI validation set are $\mathbf{1.82\sim 10.91\%}$ \textbf{mAP in BEV} and $\mathbf{1.18\sim 9.36\%}$ \textbf{mAP in 3D}). Codes have been released at \url{https://github.com/mrsempress/OBMO}."
2212.10265,"High-resolution canopy height map in the Landes forest (France) based on   GEDI, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data with a deep learning approach","In intensively managed forests in Europe, where forests are divided into stands of small size and may show heterogeneity within stands, a high spatial resolution (10 - 20 meters) is arguably needed to capture the differences in canopy height. In this work, we developed a deep learning model based on multi-stream remote sensing measurements to create a high-resolution canopy height map over the ""Landes de Gascogne"" forest in France, a large maritime pine plantation of 13,000 km$^2$ with flat terrain and intensive management. This area is characterized by even-aged and mono-specific stands, of a typical length of a few hundred meters, harvested every 35 to 50 years. Our deep learning U-Net model uses multi-band images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 with composite time averages as input to predict tree height derived from GEDI waveforms. The evaluation is performed with external validation data from forest inventory plots and a stereo 3D reconstruction model based on Skysat imagery available at specific locations. We trained seven different U-net models based on a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands to evaluate the importance of each instrument in the dominant height retrieval. The model outputs allow us to generate a 10 m resolution canopy height map of the whole ""Landes de Gascogne"" forest area for 2020 with a mean absolute error of 2.02 m on the Test dataset. The best predictions were obtained using all available satellite layers from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 but using only one satellite source also provided good predictions. For all validation datasets in coniferous forests, our model showed better metrics than previous canopy height models available in the same region."
2212.10340,Weakly supervised training of universal visual concepts for multi-domain   semantic segmentation,"Deep supervised models have an unprecedented capacity to absorb large quantities of training data. Hence, training on multiple datasets becomes a method of choice towards strong generalization in usual scenes and graceful performance degradation in edge cases. Unfortunately, different datasets often have incompatible labels. For instance, the Cityscapes road class subsumes all driving surfaces, while Vistas defines separate classes for road markings, manholes etc. Furthermore, many datasets have overlapping labels. For instance, pickups are labeled as trucks in VIPER, cars in Vistas, and vans in ADE20k. We address this challenge by considering labels as unions of universal visual concepts. This allows seamless and principled learning on multi-domain dataset collections without requiring any relabeling effort. Our method achieves competitive within-dataset and cross-dataset generalization, as well as ability to learn visual concepts which are not separately labeled in any of the training datasets. Experiments reveal competitive or state-of-the-art performance on two multi-domain dataset collections and on the WildDash 2 benchmark."
2212.10537,Does CLIP Bind Concepts? Probing Compositionality in Large Image Models,"Large-scale neural network models combining text and images have made incredible progress in recent years. However, it remains an open question to what extent such models encode compositional representations of the concepts over which they operate, such as correctly identifying ""red cube"" by reasoning over the constituents ""red"" and ""cube"". In this work, we focus on the ability of a large pretrained vision and language model (CLIP) to encode compositional concepts and to bind variables in a structure-sensitive way (e.g., differentiating ""cube behind sphere"" from ""sphere behind cube""). To inspect the performance of CLIP, we compare several architectures from research on compositional distributional semantics models (CDSMs), a line of research that attempts to implement traditional compositional linguistic structures within embedding spaces. We benchmark them on three synthetic datasets - single-object, two-object, and relational - designed to test concept binding. We find that CLIP can compose concepts in a single-object setting, but in situations where concept binding is needed, performance drops dramatically. At the same time, CDSMs also perform poorly, with best performance at chance level."
2212.10744,An Audio-Visual Speech Separation Model Inspired by   Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Circuits,"Audio-visual approaches involving visual inputs have laid the foundation for recent progress in speech separation. However, the optimization of the concurrent usage of auditory and visual inputs is still an active research area. Inspired by the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit, in which the sensory processing mechanisms of different modalities modulate one another via the non-lemniscal sensory thalamus, we propose a novel cortico-thalamo-cortical neural network (CTCNet) for audio-visual speech separation (AVSS). First, the CTCNet learns hierarchical auditory and visual representations in a bottom-up manner in separate auditory and visual subnetworks, mimicking the functions of the auditory and visual cortical areas. Then, inspired by the large number of connections between cortical regions and the thalamus, the model fuses the auditory and visual information in a thalamic subnetwork through top-down connections. Finally, the model transmits this fused information back to the auditory and visual subnetworks, and the above process is repeated several times. The results of experiments on three speech separation benchmark datasets show that CTCNet remarkably outperforms existing AVSS methods with considerably fewer parameters. These results suggest that mimicking the anatomical connectome of the mammalian brain has great potential for advancing the development of deep neural networks. Project repo is https://github.com/JusperLee/CTCNet."
2212.10772,Low-Light Image and Video Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey and Beyond,"This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-light image and video enhancement, addressing two primary challenges in the field. The first challenge is the prevalence of mixed over-/under-exposed images, which are not adequately addressed by existing methods. In response, this work introduces two enhanced variants of the SICE dataset: SICE_Grad and SICE_Mix, designed to better represent these complexities. The second challenge is the scarcity of suitable low-light video datasets for training and testing. To address this, the paper introduces the Night Wenzhou dataset, a large-scale, high-resolution video collection that features challenging fast-moving aerial scenes and streetscapes with varied illuminations and degradation. This study also conducts an extensive analysis of key techniques and performs comparative experiments using the proposed and current benchmark datasets. The survey concludes by highlighting emerging applications, discussing unresolved challenges, and suggesting future research directions within the LLIE community. The datasets are available at https://github.com/ShenZheng2000/LLIE_Survey."
2212.10888,"A Survey of Mix-based Data Augmentation: Taxonomy, Methods,   Applications, and Explainability","Data augmentation (DA) is indispensable in modern machine learning and deep neural networks. The basic idea of DA is to construct new training data to improve the model's generalization by adding slightly disturbed versions of existing data or synthesizing new data. This survey comprehensively reviews a crucial subset of DA techniques, namely Mix-based Data Augmentation (MixDA), which generates novel samples by combining multiple examples. In contrast to traditional DA approaches that operate on single samples or entire datasets, MixDA stands out due to its effectiveness, simplicity, flexibility, computational efficiency, theoretical foundation, and broad applicability. We begin by introducing a novel taxonomy that categorizes MixDA into Mixup-based, Cutmix-based, and mixture approaches based on a hierarchical perspective of the data mixing operation. Subsequently, we provide an in-depth review of various MixDA techniques, focusing on their underlying motivations. Owing to its versatility, MixDA has penetrated a wide range of applications, which we also thoroughly investigate in this survey. Moreover, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of MixDA's effectiveness by examining its impact on model generalization and calibration while providing insights into the model's behavior by analyzing the inherent properties of MixDA. Finally, we recapitulate the critical findings and fundamental challenges of current MixDA studies while outlining the potential directions for future works. Different from previous related surveys that focus on DA approaches in specific domains (e.g., CV and NLP) or only review a limited subset of MixDA studies, we are the first to provide a systematical survey of MixDA, covering its taxonomy, methodology, application, and explainability. Furthermore, we provide promising directions for researchers interested in this exciting area."
2212.10950,UNIKD: UNcertainty-filtered Incremental Knowledge Distillation for   Neural Implicit Representation,"Recent neural implicit representations (NIRs) have achieved great success in the tasks of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, they require the images of a scene from different camera views to be available for one-time training. This is expensive especially for scenarios with large-scale scenes and limited data storage. In view of this, we explore the task of incremental learning for NIRs in this work. We design a student-teacher framework to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem. Specifically, we iterate the process of using the student as the teacher at the end of each time step and let the teacher guide the training of the student in the next step. As a result, the student network is able to learn new information from the streaming data and retain old knowledge from the teacher network simultaneously. Although intuitive, naively applying the student-teacher pipeline does not work well in our task. Not all information from the teacher network is helpful since it is only trained with the old data. To alleviate this problem, we further introduce a random inquirer and an uncertainty-based filter to filter useful information. Our proposed method is general and thus can be adapted to different implicit representations such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and neural surface field. Extensive experimental results for both 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to different baselines."
2212.11120,Deep Learning for Inertial Sensor Alignment,"Accurate alignment of a fixed mobile device equipped with inertial sensors inside a moving vehicle is important for navigation, activity recognition, and other applications. Accurate estimation of the device mounting angle is required to rotate the inertial measurement from the sensor frame to the moving platform frame to standardize measurements and improve the performance of the target task. In this work, a data-driven approach using deep neural networks (DNNs) is proposed to learn the yaw mounting angle of a smartphone equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and strapped to a car. The proposed model uses only the accelerometer and gyroscope readings from an IMU as input and, in contrast to existing solutions, does not require global position inputs from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). To train the model in a supervised manner, IMU data is collected for training and validation with the sensor mounted at a known yaw mounting angle, and a range of ground truth labels is generated by applying a random rotation in a bounded range to the measurements. The trained model is tested on data with real rotations showing similar performance as with synthetic rotations. The trained model is deployed on an Android device and evaluated in real-time to test the accuracy of the estimated yaw mounting angle. The model is shown to find the mounting angle at an accuracy of 8 degrees within 5 seconds, and 4 degrees within 27 seconds. An experiment is conducted to compare the proposed model with an existing off-the-shelf solution."
2212.11146,The Challenges of HTR Model Training: Feedback from the Project Donner   le gout de l'archive a l'ere numerique,"The arrival of handwriting recognition technologies offers new possibilities for research in heritage studies. However, it is now necessary to reflect on the experiences and the practices developed by research teams. Our use of the Transkribus platform since 2018 has led us to search for the most significant ways to improve the performance of our handwritten text recognition (HTR) models which are made to transcribe French handwriting dating from the 17th century. This article therefore reports on the impacts of creating transcribing protocols, using the language model at full scale and determining the best way to use base models in order to help increase the performance of HTR models. Combining all of these elements can indeed increase the performance of a single model by more than 20% (reaching a Character Error Rate below 5%). This article also discusses some challenges regarding the collaborative nature of HTR platforms such as Transkribus and the way researchers can share their data generated in the process of creating or training handwritten text recognition models."
2212.11152,OpenPack: A Large-scale Dataset for Recognizing Packaging Works in   IoT-enabled Logistic Environments,"Unlike human daily activities, existing publicly available sensor datasets for work activity recognition in industrial domains are limited by difficulties in collecting realistic data as close collaboration with industrial sites is required. This also limits research on and development of methods for industrial applications. To address these challenges and contribute to research on machine recognition of work activities in industrial domains, in this study, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for packaging work recognition called OpenPack. OpenPack contains 53.8 hours of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration data, keypoints, depth images, and readings from IoT-enabled devices (e.g., handheld barcode scanners), collected from 16 distinct subjects with different levels of packaging work experience. We apply state-of-the-art human activity recognition techniques to the dataset and provide future directions of complex work activity recognition studies in the pervasive computing community based on the results. We believe that OpenPack will contribute to the sensor-based action/activity recognition community by providing challenging tasks. The OpenPack dataset is available at https://open-pack.github.io."
2212.11172,A recurrent CNN for online object detection on raw radar frames,"Automotive radar sensors provide valuable information for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Radars can reliably estimate the distance to an object and the relative velocity, regardless of weather and light conditions. However, radar sensors suffer from low resolution and huge intra-class variations in the shape of objects. Exploiting the time information (e.g., multiple frames) has been shown to help to capture better the dynamics of objects and, therefore, the variation in the shape of objects. Most temporal radar object detectors use 3D convolutions to learn spatial and temporal information. However, these methods are often non-causal and unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents RECORD, a new recurrent CNN architecture for online radar object detection. We propose an end-to-end trainable architecture mixing convolutions and ConvLSTMs to learn spatio-temporal dependencies between successive frames. Our model is causal and requires only the past information encoded in the memory of the ConvLSTMs to detect objects. Our experiments show such a method's relevance for detecting objects in different radar representations (range-Doppler, range-angle) and outperform state-of-the-art models on the ROD2021 and CARRADA datasets while being less computationally expensive."
2212.11192,Continual Learning Approaches for Anomaly Detection,"Anomaly Detection is a relevant problem that arises in numerous real-world applications, especially when dealing with images. However, there has been little research for this task in the Continual Learning setting. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called SCALE (SCALing is Enough) to perform Compressed Replay in a framework for Anomaly Detection in Continual Learning setting. The proposed technique scales and compresses the original images using a Super Resolution model which, to the best of our knowledge, is studied for the first time in the Continual Learning setting. SCALE can achieve a high level of compression while maintaining a high level of image reconstruction quality. In conjunction with other Anomaly Detection approaches, it can achieve optimal results. To validate the proposed approach, we use a real-world dataset of images with pixel-based anomalies, with the scope to provide a reliable benchmark for Anomaly Detection in the context of Continual Learning, serving as a foundation for further advancements in the field."
2212.11237,Not Just Pretty Pictures: Toward Interventional Data Augmentation Using   Text-to-Image Generators,"Neural image classifiers are known to undergo severe performance degradation when exposed to inputs that are sampled from environmental conditions that differ from their training data. Given the recent progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, a natural question is how modern T2I generators can be used to simulate arbitrary interventions over such environmental factors in order to augment training data and improve the robustness of downstream classifiers. We experiment across a diverse collection of benchmarks in single domain generalization (SDG) and reducing reliance on spurious features (RRSF), ablating across key dimensions of T2I generation, including interventional prompting strategies, conditioning mechanisms, and post-hoc filtering. Our extensive empirical findings demonstrate that modern T2I generators like Stable Diffusion can indeed be used as a powerful interventional data augmentation mechanism, outperforming previously state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques regardless of how each dimension is configured."
2212.11542,Mask Focal Loss: A unifying framework for dense crowd counting with   canonical object detection networks,"As a fundamental computer vision task, crowd counting plays an important role in public safety. Currently, deep learning based head detection is a promising method for crowd counting. However, the highly concerned object detection networks cannot be well applied to this problem for three reasons: (1) Existing loss functions fail to address sample imbalance in highly dense and complex scenes; (2) Canonical object detectors lack spatial coherence in loss calculation, disregarding the relationship between object location and background region; (3) Most of the head detection datasets are only annotated with the center points, i.e. without bounding boxes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Mask Focal Loss (MFL) based on heatmap via the Gaussian kernel. MFL provides a unifying framework for the loss functions based on both heatmap and binary feature map ground truths. Additionally, we introduce GTA_Head, a synthetic dataset with comprehensive annotations, for evaluation and comparison. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our MFL across various detectors and datasets, and it can reduce MAE and RMSE by up to 47.03% and 61.99%, respectively. Therefore, our work presents a strong foundation for advancing crowd counting methods based on density estimation."
2212.11920,Beyond SOT: Tracking Multiple Generic Objects at Once,"Generic Object Tracking (GOT) is the problem of tracking target objects, specified by bounding boxes in the first frame of a video. While the task has received much attention in the last decades, researchers have almost exclusively focused on the single object setting. Multi-object GOT benefits from a wider applicability, rendering it more attractive in real-world applications. We attribute the lack of research interest into this problem to the absence of suitable benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale GOT benchmark, LaGOT, containing multiple annotated target objects per sequence. Our benchmark allows users to tackle key remaining challenges in GOT, aiming to increase robustness and reduce computation through joint tracking of multiple objects simultaneously. In addition, we propose a transformer-based GOT tracker baseline capable of joint processing of multiple objects through shared computation. Our approach achieves a 4x faster run-time in case of 10 concurrent objects compared to tracking each object independently and outperforms existing single object trackers on our new benchmark. In addition, our approach achieves highly competitive results on single-object GOT datasets, setting a new state of the art on TrackingNet with a success rate AUC of 84.4%. Our benchmark, code, and trained models will be made publicly available."
2212.12043,When are Lemons Purple? The Concept Association Bias of Vision-Language   Models,"Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have shown impressive performance on zero-shot image classification and image-to-text retrieval. However, such performance does not realize in tasks that require a finer-grained correspondence between vision and language, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). As a potential cause of the difficulty of applying these models to VQA and similar tasks, we report an interesting phenomenon of vision-language models, which we call the Concept Association Bias (CAB). We find that models with CAB tend to treat input as a bag of concepts and attempt to fill in the other missing concept crossmodally, leading to an unexpected zero-shot prediction. We demonstrate CAB by showing that CLIP's zero-shot classification performance greatly suffers when there is a strong concept association between an object (e.g. eggplant) and an attribute (e.g. color purple). We also show that the strength of CAB predicts the performance on VQA. We observe that CAB is prevalent in vision-language models trained with contrastive losses, even when autoregressive losses are jointly employed. However, a model that solely relies on autoregressive loss seems to exhibit minimal or no signs of CAB."
2212.12130,Learning to Detect and Segment for Open Vocabulary Object Detection,"Open vocabulary object detection has been greatly advanced by the recent development of vision-language pretrained model, which helps recognize novel objects with only semantic categories. The prior works mainly focus on knowledge transferring to the object proposal classification and employ class-agnostic box and mask prediction. In this work, we propose CondHead, a principled dynamic network design to better generalize the box regression and mask segmentation for open vocabulary setting. The core idea is to conditionally parameterize the network heads on semantic embedding and thus the model is guided with class-specific knowledge to better detect novel categories. Specifically, CondHead is composed of two streams of network heads, the dynamically aggregated head and the dynamically generated head. The former is instantiated with a set of static heads that are conditionally aggregated, these heads are optimized as experts and are expected to learn sophisticated prediction. The latter is instantiated with dynamically generated parameters and encodes general class-specific information. With such a conditional design, the detection model is bridged by the semantic embedding to offer strongly generalizable class-wise box and mask prediction. Our method brings significant improvement to the state-of-the-art open vocabulary object detection methods with very minor overhead, e.g., it surpasses a RegionClip model by 3.0 detection AP on novel categories, with only 1.1% more computation."
2212.12141,Human Activity Recognition in an Open World,"Managing novelty in perception-based human activity recognition (HAR) is critical in realistic settings to improve task performance over time and ensure solution generalization outside of prior seen samples. Novelty manifests in HAR as unseen samples, activities, objects, environments, and sensor changes, among other ways. Novelty may be task-relevant, such as a new class or new features, or task-irrelevant resulting in nuisance novelty, such as never before seen noise, blur, or distorted video recordings. To perform HAR optimally, algorithmic solutions must be tolerant to nuisance novelty, and learn over time in the face of novelty. This paper 1) formalizes the definition of novelty in HAR building upon the prior definition of novelty in classification tasks, 2) proposes an incremental open world learning (OWL) protocol and applies it to the Kinetics datasets to generate a new benchmark KOWL-718, 3) analyzes the performance of current state-of-the-art HAR models when novelty is introduced over time, 4) provides a containerized and packaged pipeline for reproducing the OWL protocol and for modifying for any future updates to Kinetics. The experimental analysis includes an ablation study of how the different models perform under various conditions as annotated by Kinetics-AVA. The protocol as an algorithm for reproducing experiments using the KOWL-718 benchmark will be publicly released with code and containers at https://github.com/prijatelj/human-activity-recognition-in-an-open-world. The code may be used to analyze different annotations and subsets of the Kinetics datasets in an incremental open world fashion, as well as be extended as further updates to Kinetics are released."
2212.12206,Understanding and Improving Transfer Learning of Deep Models via Neural   Collapse,"With the ever-increasing complexity of large-scale pre-trained models coupled with a shortage of labeled data for downstream training, transfer learning has become the primary approach in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal learning. Despite recent progress, the fine-tuning process for large-scale pre-trained models in vision still mostly relies on trial and error. This work investigates the relationship between neural collapse (NC) and transfer learning for classification problems. NC is an intriguing while prevalent phenomenon that has been recently discovered in terms of the final-layer features and linear classifiers of trained neural networks. Specifically, during the terminal phase of training, NC implies that the variability of the features within each class diminishes to zero, while the means of features between classes are maximally and equally distanced. In this work, we examine the NC attributes of pre-trained models on both downstream and source data for transfer learning, and we find strong correlation between feature collapse and downstream performance. In particular, we discovered a systematic pattern that emerges when linear probing pre-trained models on downstream training data: the more feature collapse of pre-trained models on downstream training data, the higher the transfer accuracy. Additionally, we also studied the relationship between NC and transfer accuracy on the source data. Moreover, these findings allow us to develop a principled, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that employs skip-connection to induce the last-layer feature collapse on downstream data. Our proposed fine-tuning methods deliver good performances while reducing fine-tuning parameters by at least 90% and mitigating overfitting in situations especially when the downstream data is scarce."
2212.12218,Fast Event-based Optical Flow Estimation by Triplet Matching,"Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that offer advantages over traditional cameras (low latency, high dynamic range, low power, etc.). Optical flow estimation methods that work on packets of events trade off speed for accuracy, while event-by-event (incremental) methods have strong assumptions and have not been tested on common benchmarks that quantify progress in the field. Towards applications on resource-constrained devices, it is important to develop optical flow algorithms that are fast, light-weight and accurate. This work leverages insights from neuroscience, and proposes a novel optical flow estimation scheme based on triplet matching. The experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate its capability to handle complex scenes with comparable results as prior packet-based algorithms. In addition, the proposed method achieves the fastest execution time (> 10 kHz) on standard CPUs as it requires only three events in estimation. We hope that our research opens the door to real-time, incremental motion estimation methods and applications in real-world scenarios."
2212.12322,"Infrared Image Super-Resolution: Systematic Review, and Future Trends","Image Super-Resolution (SR) is essential for a wide range of computer vision and image processing tasks. Investigating infrared (IR) image (or thermal images) super-resolution is a continuing concern within the development of deep learning. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective of IR image super-resolution, including its applications, hardware imaging system dilemmas, and taxonomy of image processing methodologies. In addition, the datasets and evaluation metrics in IR image super-resolution tasks are also discussed. Furthermore, the deficiencies in current technologies and possible promising directions for the community to explore are highlighted. To cope with the rapid development in this field, we intend to regularly update the relevant excellent work at \url{https://github.com/yongsongH/Infrared_Image_SR_Survey"
2212.12499,Posterior-Variance-Based Error Quantification for Inverse Problems in   Imaging,"In this work, a method for obtaining pixel-wise error bounds in Bayesian regularization of inverse imaging problems is introduced. The proposed method employs estimates of the posterior variance together with techniques from conformal prediction in order to obtain coverage guarantees for the error bounds, without making any assumption on the underlying data distribution. It is generally applicable to Bayesian regularization approaches, independent, e.g., of the concrete choice of the prior. Furthermore, the coverage guarantees can also be obtained in case only approximate sampling from the posterior is possible. With this in particular, the proposed framework is able to incorporate any learned prior in a black-box manner. Guaranteed coverage without assumptions on the underlying distributions is only achievable since the magnitude of the error bounds is, in general, unknown in advance. Nevertheless, experiments with multiple regularization approaches presented in the paper confirm that in practice, the obtained error bounds are rather tight. For realizing the numerical experiments, also a novel primal-dual Langevin algorithm for sampling from non-smooth distributions is introduced in this work."
2212.12741,LMFLOSS: A Hybrid Loss For Imbalanced Medical Image Classification,"With advances in digital technology, the classification of medical images has become a crucial step for image-based clinical decision support systems. Automatic medical image classification represents a pivotal domain where the use of AI holds the potential to create a significant social impact. However, several challenges act as obstacles to the development of practical and effective solutions. One of these challenges is the prevalent class imbalance problem in most medical imaging datasets. As a result, existing AI techniques, particularly deep-learning-based methodologies, often underperform in such scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Large Margin aware Focal (LMF) loss to mitigate the class imbalance problem in medical imaging. The LMF loss represents a linear combination of two loss functions optimized by two hyperparameters. This framework harnesses the distinct characteristics of both loss functions by enforcing wider margins for minority classes while simultaneously emphasizing challenging samples found in the datasets. We perform rigorous experiments on three neural network architectures and with four medical imaging datasets. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed framework consistently outperforms other baseline methods, showing an improvement of 2%-9% in macro-f1 scores. Through class-wise analysis of f1 scores, we also demonstrate how the proposed framework can significantly improve performance for minority classes. The results of our experiments show that our proposed framework can perform consistently well across different architectures and datasets. Overall, our study demonstrates a simple and effective approach to addressing the class imbalance problem in medical imaging datasets. We hope our work will inspire new research toward a more generalized approach to medical image classification."
2212.12770,COLT: Cyclic Overlapping Lottery Tickets for Faster Pruning of   Convolutional Neural Networks,"Pruning refers to the elimination of trivial weights from neural networks. The sub-networks within an overparameterized model produced after pruning are often called Lottery tickets. This research aims to generate winning lottery tickets from a set of lottery tickets that can achieve similar accuracy to the original unpruned network. We introduce a novel winning ticket called Cyclic Overlapping Lottery Ticket (COLT) by data splitting and cyclic retraining of the pruned network from scratch. We apply a cyclic pruning algorithm that keeps only the overlapping weights of different pruned models trained on different data segments. Our results demonstrate that COLT can achieve similar accuracies (obtained by the unpruned model) while maintaining high sparsities. We show that the accuracy of COLT is on par with the winning tickets of Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and, at times, is better. Moreover, COLTs can be generated using fewer iterations than tickets generated by the popular Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) method. In addition, we also notice COLTs generated on large datasets can be transferred to small ones without compromising performance, demonstrating its generalizing capability. We conduct all our experiments on Cifar-10, Cifar-100 & TinyImageNet datasets and report superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods."
2212.12824,Meta-Learning for Color-to-Infrared Cross-Modal Style Transfer,"Recent object detection models for infrared (IR) imagery are based upon deep neural networks (DNNs) and require large amounts of labeled training imagery. However, publicly available datasets that can be used for such training are limited in their size and diversity. To address this problem, we explore cross-modal style transfer (CMST) to leverage large and diverse color imagery datasets so that they can be used to train DNN-based IR image-based object detectors. We evaluate six contemporary stylization methods on four publicly-available IR datasets - the first comparison of its kind - and find that CMST is highly effective for DNN-based detectors. Surprisingly, we find that existing data-driven methods are outperformed by a simple grayscale stylization (an average of the color channels). Our analysis reveals that existing data-driven methods are either too simplistic or introduce significant artifacts into the imagery. To overcome these limitations, we propose meta-learning style transfer (MLST), which learns a stylization by composing and tuning well-behaved analytic functions. We find that MLST leads to more complex stylizations without introducing significant image artifacts and achieves the best overall detector performance on our benchmark datasets."
2212.12857,StepNet: Spatial-temporal Part-aware Network for Isolated Sign Language   Recognition,"The goal of sign language recognition (SLR) is to help those who are hard of hearing or deaf overcome the communication barrier. Most existing approaches can be typically divided into two lines, i.e., Skeleton-based and RGB-based methods, but both the two lines of methods have their limitations. Skeleton-based methods do not consider facial expressions, while RGB-based approaches usually ignore the fine-grained hand structure. To overcome both limitations, we propose a new framework called Spatial-temporal Part-aware network~(StepNet), based on RGB parts. As its name suggests, it is made up of two modules: Part-level Spatial Modeling and Part-level Temporal Modeling. Part-level Spatial Modeling, in particular, automatically captures the appearance-based properties, such as hands and faces, in the feature space without the use of any keypoint-level annotations. On the other hand, Part-level Temporal Modeling implicitly mines the long-short term context to capture the relevant attributes over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StepNet, thanks to spatial-temporal modules, achieves competitive Top-1 Per-instance accuracy on three commonly-used SLR benchmarks, i.e., 56.89% on WLASL, 77.2% on NMFs-CSL, and 77.1% on BOBSL. Additionally, the proposed method is compatible with the optical flow input and can produce superior performance if fused. For those who are hard of hearing, we hope that our work can act as a preliminary step."
2212.12965,BD-KD: Balancing the Divergences for Online Knowledge Distillation,"We address the challenge of producing trustworthy and accurate compact models for edge devices. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) has improved model compression in terms of achieving high accuracy performance, calibration of these compact models has been overlooked. We introduce BD-KD (Balanced Divergence Knowledge Distillation), a framework for logit-based online KD. BD-KD enhances both accuracy and model calibration simultaneously, eliminating the need for post-hoc recalibration techniques, which add computational overhead to the overall training pipeline and degrade performance. Our method encourages student-centered training by adjusting the conventional online distillation loss on both the student and teacher losses, employing sample-wise weighting of forward and reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. This strategy balances student network confidence and boosts performance. Experiments across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, and various architectures demonstrate improved calibration and accuracy compared to recent online KD methods."
2212.13023,Improving Continuous Sign Language Recognition with Consistency   Constraints and Signer Removal,"Most deep-learning-based continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) models share a similar backbone consisting of a visual module, a sequential module, and an alignment module. However, due to limited training samples, a connectionist temporal classification loss may not train such CSLR backbones sufficiently. In this work, we propose three auxiliary tasks to enhance the CSLR backbones. The first task enhances the visual module, which is sensitive to the insufficient training problem, from the perspective of consistency. Specifically, since the information of sign languages is mainly included in signers' facial expressions and hand movements, a keypoint-guided spatial attention module is developed to enforce the visual module to focus on informative regions, i.e., spatial attention consistency. Second, noticing that both the output features of the visual and sequential modules represent the same sentence, to better exploit the backbone's power, a sentence embedding consistency constraint is imposed between the visual and sequential modules to enhance the representation power of both features. We name the CSLR model trained with the above auxiliary tasks as consistency-enhanced CSLR, which performs well on signer-dependent datasets in which all signers appear during both training and testing. To make it more robust for the signer-independent setting, a signer removal module based on feature disentanglement is further proposed to remove signer information from the backbone. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of these auxiliary tasks. More remarkably, with a transformer-based backbone, our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on five benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014-T, PHOENIX-2014-SI, CSL, and CSL-Daily. Code and Models are available at https://github.com/2000ZRL/LCSA_C2SLR_SRM."
2212.13253,DSI2I: Dense Style for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation,"Unpaired exemplar-based image-to-image (UEI2I) translation aims to translate a source image to a target image domain with the style of a target image exemplar, without ground-truth input-translation pairs. Existing UEI2I methods represent style using one vector per image or rely on semantic supervision to define one style vector per object. Here, in contrast, we propose to represent style as a dense feature map, allowing for a finer-grained transfer to the source image without requiring any external semantic information. We then rely on perceptual and adversarial losses to disentangle our dense style and content representations. To stylize the source content with the exemplar style, we extract unsupervised cross-domain semantic correspondences and warp the exemplar style to the source content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on four datasets using standard metrics together with a localized style metric we propose, which measures style similarity in a class-wise manner. Our results show that the translations produced by our approach are more diverse, preserve the source content better, and are closer to the exemplars when compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://github.com/IVRL/dsi2i"
2212.13459,Scaling Painting Style Transfer,"Neural style transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that produces an unprecedentedly rich style transfer from a style image to a content image. It is particularly impressive when it comes to transferring style from a painting to an image. NST was originally achieved by solving an optimization problem to match the global statistics of the style image while preserving the local geometric features of the content image. The two main drawbacks of this original approach is that it is computationally expensive and that the resolution of the output images is limited by high GPU memory requirements. Many solutions have been proposed to both accelerate NST and produce images with larger size. However, our investigation shows that these accelerated methods all compromise the quality of the produced images in the context of painting style transfer. Indeed, transferring the style of a painting is a complex task involving features at different scales, from the color palette and compositional style to the fine brushstrokes and texture of the canvas. This paper provides a solution to solve the original global optimization for ultra-high resolution (UHR) images, enabling multiscale NST at unprecedented image sizes. This is achieved by spatially localizing the computation of each forward and backward passes through the VGG network. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons, as well as a \textcolor{coverletter}{perceptual study}, show that our method produces style transfer of unmatched quality for such high-resolution painting styles. By a careful comparison, we show that state-of-the-art fast methods are still prone to artifacts, thus suggesting that fast painting style transfer remains an open problem. Source code is available at https://github.com/bgalerne/scaling_painting_style_transfer."
2212.13462,MVTN: Learning Multi-View Transformations for 3D Understanding,"Multi-view projection techniques have shown themselves to be highly effective in achieving top-performing results in the recognition of 3D shapes. These methods involve learning how to combine information from multiple view-points. However, the camera view-points from which these views are obtained are often fixed for all shapes. To overcome the static nature of current multi-view techniques, we propose learning these view-points. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN), which uses differentiable rendering to determine optimal view-points for 3D shape recognition. As a result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end with any multi-view network for 3D shape classification. We integrate MVTN into a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline that is capable of rendering both 3D meshes and point clouds. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification and shape retrieval on several benchmarks (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55). Further analysis indicates that our approach exhibits improved robustness to occlusion compared to other methods. We also investigate additional aspects of MVTN, such as 2D pretraining and its use for segmentation. To support further research in this area, we have released MVTorch, a PyTorch library for 3D understanding and generation using multi-view projections."
2212.13599,Brain Cancer Segmentation Using YOLOv5 Deep Neural Network,"An expansion of aberrant brain cells is referred to as a brain tumor. The brain's architecture is extremely intricate, with several regions controlling various nervous system processes. Any portion of the brain or skull can develop a brain tumor, including the brain's protective coating, the base of the skull, the brainstem, the sinuses, the nasal cavity, and many other places. Over the past ten years, numerous developments in the field of computer-aided brain tumor diagnosis have been made. Recently, instance segmentation has attracted a lot of interest in numerous computer vision applications. It seeks to assign various IDs to various scene objects, even if they are members of the same class. Typically, a two-stage pipeline is used to perform instance segmentation. This study shows brain cancer segmentation using YOLOv5. Yolo takes dataset as picture format and corresponding text file. You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a viral and widely used algorithm. YOLO is famous for its object recognition properties. You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular algorithm that has gone viral. YOLO is well known for its ability to identify objects. YOLO V2, V3, V4, and V5 are some of the YOLO latest versions that experts have published in recent years. Early brain tumor detection is one of the most important jobs that neurologists and radiologists have. However, it can be difficult and error-prone to manually identify and segment brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. For making an early diagnosis of the condition, an automated brain tumor detection system is necessary. The model of the research paper has three classes. They are respectively Meningioma, Pituitary, Glioma. The results show that, our model achieves competitive accuracy, in terms of runtime usage of M2 10 core GPU."
2212.13693,Parsing Objects at a Finer Granularity: A Survey,"Fine-grained visual parsing, including fine-grained part segmentation and fine-grained object recognition, has attracted considerable critical attention due to its importance in many real-world applications, e.g., agriculture, remote sensing, and space technologies. Predominant research efforts tackle these fine-grained sub-tasks following different paradigms, while the inherent relations between these tasks are neglected. Moreover, given most of the research remains fragmented, we conduct an in-depth study of the advanced work from a new perspective of learning the part relationship. In this perspective, we first consolidate recent research and benchmark syntheses with new taxonomies. Based on this consolidation, we revisit the universal challenges in fine-grained part segmentation and recognition tasks and propose new solutions by part relationship learning for these important challenges. Furthermore, we conclude several promising lines of research in fine-grained visual parsing for future research."
2212.13764,Representation Separation for Semantic Segmentation with Vision   Transformers,"Vision transformers (ViTs) encoding an image as a sequence of patches bring new paradigms for semantic segmentation.We present an efficient framework of representation separation in local-patch level and global-region level for semantic segmentation with ViTs. It is targeted for the peculiar over-smoothness of ViTs in semantic segmentation, and therefore differs from current popular paradigms of context modeling and most existing related methods reinforcing the advantage of attention. We first deliver the decoupled two-pathway network in which another pathway enhances and passes down local-patch discrepancy complementary to global representations of transformers. We then propose the spatially adaptive separation module to obtain more separate deep representations and the discriminative cross-attention which yields more discriminative region representations through novel auxiliary supervisions. The proposed methods achieve some impressive results: 1) incorporated with large-scale plain ViTs, our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performances on five widely used benchmarks; 2) using masked pre-trained plain ViTs, we achieve 68.9% mIoU on Pascal Context, setting a new record; 3) pyramid ViTs integrated with the decoupled two-pathway network even surpass the well-designed high-resolution ViTs on Cityscapes; 4) the improved representations by our framework have favorable transferability in images with natural corruptions. The codes will be released publicly."
2212.13925,Quality at the Tail of Machine Learning Inference,"Machine learning inference should be subject to stringent inference time constraints while ensuring high inference quality, especially in safety-critical (e.g., autonomous driving) and mission-critical (e.g., emotion recognition) contexts. Neglecting either aspect can lead to severe consequences, such as loss of life and property damage. Many studies lack a comprehensive consideration of these metrics, leading to incomplete or misleading evaluations. The study unveils a counterintuitive revelation: deep learning inference quality exhibits fluctuations due to inference time. To depict this phenomenon, the authors coin a new term, ""tail quality,"" providing a more comprehensive evaluation, and overcoming conventional metric limitations. Moreover, the research proposes an initial evaluation framework to analyze factors affecting quality fluctuations, facilitating the prediction of the potential distribution of inference quality. The effectiveness of the evaluation framework is validated through experiments conducted on deep learning models for three different tasks across four systems."
2212.14162,OrthoGAN:High-Precision Image Generation for Teeth Orthodontic   Visualization,"Patients take care of what their teeth will be like after the orthodontics. Orthodontists usually describe the expectation movement based on the original smile images, which is unconvincing. The growth of deep-learning generative models change this situation. It can visualize the outcome of orthodontic treatment and help patients foresee their future teeth and facial appearance. While previous studies mainly focus on 2D or 3D virtual treatment outcome (VTO) at a profile level, the problem of simulating treatment outcome at a frontal facial image is poorly explored. In this paper, we build an efficient and accurate system for simulating virtual teeth alignment effects in a frontal facial image. Our system takes a frontal face image of a patient with visible malpositioned teeth and the patient's 3D scanned teeth model as input, and progressively generates the visual results of the patient's teeth given the specific orthodontics planning steps from the doctor (i.e., the specification of translations and rotations of individual tooth). We design a multi-modal encoder-decoder based generative model to synthesize identity-preserving frontal facial images with aligned teeth. In addition, the original image color information is used to optimize the orthodontic outcomes, making the results more natural. We conduct extensive qualitative and clinical experiments and also a pilot study to validate our method."
2212.14180,PanDepth: Joint Panoptic Segmentation and Depth Completion,"Understanding 3D environments semantically is pivotal in autonomous driving applications where multiple computer vision tasks are involved. Multi-task models provide different types of outputs for a given scene, yielding a more holistic representation while keeping the computational cost low. We propose a multi-task model for panoptic segmentation and depth completion using RGB images and sparse depth maps. Our model successfully predicts fully dense depth maps and performs semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation for every input frame. Extensive experiments were done on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset and we demonstrate that our model solves multiple tasks, without a significant increase in computational cost, while keeping high accuracy performance. Code is available at https://github.com/juanb09111/PanDepth.git"
2212.14181,Efficient Image Super-Resolution with Feature Interaction Weighted   Hybrid Network,"Lightweight image super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution images using low computational costs. However, existing methods result in the loss of middle-layer features due to activation functions. To minimize the impact of intermediate feature loss on reconstruction quality, we propose a Feature Interaction Weighted Hybrid Network (FIWHN), which comprises a series of Wide-residual Distillation Interaction Block (WDIB) as the backbone. Every third WDIB forms a Feature Shuffle Weighted Group (FSWG) by applying mutual information shuffle and fusion. Moreover, to mitigate the negative effects of intermediate feature loss, we introduce Wide Residual Weighting units within WDIB. These units effectively fuse features of varying levels of detail through a Wide-residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) and a Self-Calibrating Fusion (SCF). To compensate for global feature deficiencies, we incorporate a Transformer and explore a novel architecture to combine CNN and Transformer. We show that our FIWHN achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency through extensive experiments on low-level and high-level tasks. Codes will be available at \url{https://github.com/IVIPLab/FIWHN}."
2212.14309,Learning to mask: Towards generalized face forgery detection,"Generalizability to unseen forgery types is crucial for face forgery detectors. Recent works have made significant progress in terms of generalization by synthetic forgery data augmentation. In this work, we explore another path for improving the generalization. Our goal is to reduce the features that are easy to learn in the training phase, so as to reduce the risk of overfitting on specific forgery types. Specifically, in our method, a teacher network takes as input the face images and generates an attention map of the deep features by a diverse multihead attention ViT. The attention map is used to guide a student network to focus on the low-attended features by reducing the highly-attended deep features. A deep feature mixup strategy is also proposed to synthesize forgeries in the feature domain. Experiments demonstrate that, without data augmentation, our method is able to achieve promising performances on unseen forgeries and highly compressed data."
2212.14397,AttEntropy: On the Generalization Ability of Supervised Semantic   Segmentation Transformers to New Objects in New Domains,"In addition to impressive performance, vision transformers have demonstrated remarkable abilities to encode information they were not trained to extract. For example, this information can be used to perform segmentation or single-view depth estimation even though the networks were only trained for image recognition. We show that a similar phenomenon occurs when explicitly training transformers for semantic segmentation in a supervised manner for a set of categories: Once trained, they provide valuable information even about categories absent from the training set. This information can be used to segment objects from these never-seen-before classes in domains as varied as road obstacles, aircraft parked at a terminal, lunar rocks, and maritime hazards."
2212.14744,A Comparison Study of Deep CNN Architecture in Detecting of Pneumonia,"Pneumonia, a respiratory infection brought on by bacteria or viruses, affects a large number of people, especially in developing and impoverished countries where high levels of pollution, unclean living conditions, and overcrowding are frequently observed, along with insufficient medical infrastructure. Pleural effusion, a condition in which fluids fill the lung and complicate breathing, is brought on by pneumonia. Early detection of pneumonia is essential for ensuring curative care and boosting survival rates. The approach most usually used to diagnose pneumonia is chest X-ray imaging. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for the automatic diagnosis of bacterial and viral pneumonia in digital x-ray pictures. This article first presents the authors' technique, and then gives a comprehensive report on recent developments in the field of reliable diagnosis of pneumonia. In this study, here tuned a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network to classify plant diseases based on images and tested its performance. Deep learning architecture is compared empirically. VGG19, ResNet with 152v2, Resnext101, Seresnet152, Mobilenettv2, and DenseNet with 201 layers are among the architectures tested. Experiment data consists of two groups, sick and healthy X-ray pictures. To take appropriate action against plant diseases as soon as possible, rapid disease identification models are preferred. DenseNet201 has shown no overfitting or performance degradation in our experiments, and its accuracy tends to increase as the number of epochs increases. Further, DenseNet201 achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significantly a smaller number of parameters and within a reasonable computing time. This architecture outperforms the competition in terms of testing accuracy, scoring 95%. Each architecture was trained using Keras, using Theano as the backend."
2212.14855,Disentangled Explanations of Neural Network Predictions by Finding   Relevant Subspaces,"Explainable AI aims to overcome the black-box nature of complex ML models like neural networks by generating explanations for their predictions. Explanations often take the form of a heatmap identifying input features (e.g. pixels) that are relevant to the model's decision. These explanations, however, entangle the potentially multiple factors that enter into the overall complex decision strategy. We propose to disentangle explanations by extracting at some intermediate layer of a neural network, subspaces that capture the multiple and distinct activation patterns (e.g. visual concepts) that are relevant to the prediction. To automatically extract these subspaces, we propose two new analyses, extending principles found in PCA or ICA to explanations. These novel analyses, which we call principal relevant component analysis (PRCA) and disentangled relevant subspace analysis (DRSA), maximize relevance instead of e.g. variance or kurtosis. This allows for a much stronger focus of the analysis on what the ML model actually uses for predicting, ignoring activations or concepts to which the model is invariant. Our approach is general enough to work alongside common attribution techniques such as Shapley Value, Integrated Gradients, or LRP. Our proposed methods show to be practically useful and compare favorably to the state of the art as demonstrated on benchmarks and three use cases."
2301.00060,Morphology-based non-rigid registration of coronary computed tomography   and intravascular images through virtual catheter path optimization,"Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) provides 3D information on obstructive coronary artery disease, but cannot fully visualize high-resolution features within the vessel wall. Intravascular imaging, in contrast, can spatially resolve atherosclerotic in cross sectional slices, but is limited in capturing 3D relationships between each slice. Co-registering CCTA and intravascular images enables a variety of clinical research applications but is time consuming and user-dependent. This is due to intravascular images suffering from non-rigid distortions arising from irregularities in the imaging catheter path. To address these issues, we present a morphology-based framework for the rigid and non-rigid matching of intravascular images to CCTA images. To do this, we find the optimal virtual catheter path that samples the coronary artery in CCTA image space to recapitulate the coronary artery morphology observed in the intravascular image. We validate our framework on a multi-center cohort of 40 patients using bifurcation landmarks as ground truth for longitudinal and rotational registration. Our registration approach significantly outperforms other approaches for bifurcation alignment. By providing a differentiable framework for multi-modal vascular co-registration, our framework reduces the manual effort required to conduct large-scale multi-modal clinical studies and enables the development of machine learning-based co-registration approaches."
2301.00114,"Skeletal Video Anomaly Detection using Deep Learning: Survey, Challenges   and Future Directions","The existing methods for video anomaly detection mostly utilize videos containing identifiable facial and appearance-based features. The use of videos with identifiable faces raises privacy concerns, especially when used in a hospital or community-based setting. Appearance-based features can also be sensitive to pixel-based noise, straining the anomaly detection methods to model the changes in the background and making it difficult to focus on the actions of humans in the foreground. Structural information in the form of skeletons describing the human motion in the videos is privacy-protecting and can overcome some of the problems posed by appearance-based features. In this paper, we present a survey of privacy-protecting deep learning anomaly detection methods using skeletons extracted from videos. We present a novel taxonomy of algorithms based on the various learning approaches. We conclude that skeleton-based approaches for anomaly detection can be a plausible privacy-protecting alternative for video anomaly detection. Lastly, we identify major open research questions and provide guidelines to address them."
2301.00190,Tracking Passengers and Baggage Items using Multiple Overhead Cameras at   Security Checkpoints,"We introduce a novel framework to track multiple objects in overhead camera videos for airport checkpoint security scenarios where targets correspond to passengers and their baggage items. We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model. Our multi-camera association method achieves up to $89\%$ multi-object tracking accuracy with an average computation time of less than $15$ ms."
2301.00314,Causal Deep Learning,"We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates forward and inverse causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of the operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in a doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described."
2301.00326,Yuille-Poggio's Flow and Global Minimizer of Polynomials through   Convexification by Heat Evolution,"This study examines the convexification version of the backward differential flow algorithm for the global minimization of polynomials, introduced by O. Arikan \textit{et al} in \cite{ABK}. It investigates why this approach might fail with high-degree polynomials yet succeeds with quartic polynomials. We employ the heat evolution method for convexification combined with Gaussian filtering, which acts as a cumulative form of Steklov's regularization. In this context, we apply the fingerprint theory from computer vision. Originally developed by A.L. Yuille and T. Poggio in the 1980s for computer vision, the fingerprint theory, particularly the fingerprint trajectory equation, is used to illustrate the scaling (temporal) evolution of minimizers. In the case of general polynomials, our research has led to the creation of the Yuille-Poggio flow and a broader interpretation of the fingerprint concepts, in particular we establish the condition both sufficient and necessary for the convexified backward differential flow algorithms to successfully achieve global minimization. For quartic polynomials, our analysis not only reflects the results of O. Arikan et al. \cite{ABK} but also presents a significantly simpler version of Newton's method that can always globally minimize quartic polynomials without convexification."
2301.00349,Towards Reliable Medical Image Segmentation by utilizing Evidential   Calibrated Uncertainty,"Medical image segmentation is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce DEviS, an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging subjective logic theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for the problem of medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable calibrated uncertainty penalty. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering module, which utilizes the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter reliable data within the dataset. We conducted validation studies to assess both the accuracy and robustness of DEviS segmentation, along with evaluating the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation. These evaluations were performed using publicly available datasets including ISIC2018, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019. Additionally, two potential clinical trials are being conducted at Johns Hopkins OCT, Duke-OCT-DME, and FIVES datasets to demonstrate their efficacy in filtering high-quality or out-of-distribution data. Our code has been released in https://github.com/Cocofeat/DEviS."
2301.00371,Robust Domain Adaptive Object Detection with Unified Multi-Granularity   Alignment,"Domain adaptive detection aims to improve the generalization of detectors on target domain. To reduce discrepancy in feature distributions between two domains, recent approaches achieve domain adaption through feature alignment in different granularities via adversarial learning. However, they neglect the relationship between multiple granularities and different features in alignment, degrading detection. Addressing this, we introduce a unified multi-granularity alignment (MGA)-based detection framework for domain-invariant feature learning. The key is to encode the dependencies across different granularities including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels simultaneously to align two domains. Specifically, based on pixel-level features, we first develop an omni-scale gated fusion (OSGF) module to aggregate discriminative representations of instances with scale-aware convolutions, leading to robust multi-scale detection. Besides, we introduce multi-granularity discriminators to identify where, either source or target domains, different granularities of samples come from. Note that, MGA not only leverages instance discriminability in different categories but also exploits category consistency between two domains for detection. Furthermore, we present an adaptive exponential moving average (AEMA) strategy that explores model assessments for model update to improve pseudo labels and alleviate local misalignment problem, boosting detection robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple domain adaption scenarios validate the superiority of MGA over other approaches on FCOS and Faster R-CNN detectors. Code will be released at https://github.com/tiankongzhang/MGA."
2301.00394,Deep Learning Technique for Human Parsing: A Survey and Outlook,"Human parsing aims to partition humans in image or video into multiple pixel-level semantic parts. In the last decade, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community and has been utilized in a broad range of practical applications, from security monitoring, to social media, to visual special effects, just to name a few. Although deep learning-based human parsing solutions have made remarkable achievements, many important concepts, existing challenges, and potential research directions are still confusing. In this survey, we comprehensively review three core sub-tasks: single human parsing, multiple human parsing, and video human parsing, by introducing their respective task settings, background concepts, relevant problems and applications, representative literature, and datasets. We also present quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on benchmark datasets. Additionally, to promote sustainable development of the community, we put forward a transformer-based human parsing framework, providing a high-performance baseline for follow-up research through universal, concise, and extensible solutions. Finally, we point out a set of under-investigated open issues in this field and suggest new directions for future study. We also provide a regularly updated project page, to continuously track recent developments in this fast-advancing field: https://github.com/soeaver/awesome-human-parsing."
2301.00406,Curvature regularization for Non-line-of-sight Imaging from   Under-sampled Data,"Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging aims to reconstruct the three-dimensional hidden scenes from the data measured in the line-of-sight, which uses photon time-of-flight information encoded in light after multiple diffuse reflections. The under-sampled scanning data can facilitate fast imaging. However, the resulting reconstruction problem becomes a serious ill-posed inverse problem, the solution of which is highly possibility to be degraded due to noises and distortions. In this paper, we propose novel NLOS reconstruction models based on curvature regularization, i.e., the object-domain curvature regularization model and the dual (signal and object)-domain curvature regularization model. In what follows, we develop efficient optimization algorithms relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the backtracking stepsize rule, for which all solvers can be implemented on GPUs. We evaluate the proposed algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets, which achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially in the compressed sensing setting. Based on GPU computing, our algorithm is the most effective among iterative methods, balancing reconstruction quality and computational time. All our codes and data are available at https://github.com/Duanlab123/CurvNLOS."
2301.00524,Learning Confident Classifiers in the Presence of Label Noise,"The success of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models significantly depends on the quality of provided annotations. In medical image segmentation, for example, having multiple expert annotations for each data point is common to minimize subjective annotation bias. Then, the goal of estimation is to filter out the label noise and recover the ground-truth masks, which are not explicitly given. This paper proposes a probabilistic model for noisy observations that allows us to build a confident classification and segmentation models. To accomplish it, we explicitly model label noise and introduce a new information-based regularization that pushes the network to recover the ground-truth labels. In addition, for segmentation task we adjust the loss function by prioritizing learning in high-confidence regions where all the annotators agree on labeling. We evaluate the proposed method on a series of classification tasks such as noisy versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST datasets as well as CIFAR-10N, which is real-world dataset with noisy human annotations. Additionally, for segmentation task, we consider several medical imaging datasets, such as, LIDC and RIGA that reflect real-world inter-variability among multiple annotators. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for the considered classification and segmentation problems."
2301.00555,Scene Structure Guidance Network: Unfolding Graph Partitioning into Pixel-Wise Feature Learning,"Understanding the informative structures of scenes is essential for low-level vision tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 56K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications. We also demonstrate that our network generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks. We further propose a lighter version of SSGNet ($\sim$ 29K parameters) for depth computation, SSGNet-D, and successfully execute it on edge computing devices like Jetson AGX Orin, improving the performance of baseline network, even in the wild, with little computational delay."
2301.00618,An Event-based Algorithm for Simultaneous 6-DOF Camera Pose Tracking and   Mapping,"Compared to regular cameras, Dynamic Vision Sensors or Event Cameras can output compact visual data based on a change in the intensity in each pixel location asynchronously. In this paper, we study the application of current image-based SLAM techniques to these novel sensors. To this end, the information in adaptively selected event windows is processed to form motion-compensated images. These images are then used to reconstruct the scene and estimate the 6-DOF pose of the camera. We also propose an inertial version of the event-only pipeline to assess its capabilities. We compare the results of different configurations of the proposed algorithm against the ground truth for sequences of two publicly available event datasets. We also compare the results of the proposed event-inertial pipeline with the state-of-the-art and show it can produce comparable or more accurate results provided the map estimate is reliable."
2301.00785,CLIP-Driven Universal Model for Organ Segmentation and Tumor Detection,"An increasing number of public datasets have shown a marked impact on automated organ segmentation and tumor detection. However, due to the small size and partially labeled problem of each dataset, as well as a limited investigation of diverse types of tumors, the resulting models are often limited to segmenting specific organs/tumors and ignore the semantics of anatomical structures, nor can they be extended to novel domains. To address these issues, we propose the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, which incorporates text embedding learned from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to segmentation models. This CLIP-based label encoding captures anatomical relationships, enabling the model to learn a structured feature embedding and segment 25 organs and 6 types of tumors. The proposed model is developed from an assembly of 14 datasets, using a total of 3,410 CT scans for training and then evaluated on 6,162 external CT scans from 3 additional datasets. We rank first on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) public leaderboard and achieve state-of-the-art results on Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV). Additionally, the Universal Model is computationally more efficient (6x faster) compared with dataset-specific models, generalized better to CT scans from varying sites, and shows stronger transfer learning performance on novel tasks."
2301.00812,One-shot skill assessment in high-stakes domains with limited data via   meta learning,"Deep Learning (DL) has achieved robust competency assessment in various high-stakes fields. However, the applicability of DL models is often hampered by their substantial data requirements and confinement to specific training domains. This prevents them from transitioning to new tasks where data is scarce. Therefore, domain adaptation emerges as a critical element for the practical implementation of DL in real-world scenarios. Herein, we introduce A-VBANet, a novel meta-learning model capable of delivering domain-agnostic skill assessment via one-shot learning. Our methodology has been tested by assessing surgical skills on five laparoscopic and robotic simulators and real-life laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our model successfully adapted with accuracies up to 99.5% in one-shot and 99.9% in few-shot settings for simulated tasks and 89.7% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study marks the first instance of a domain-agnostic methodology for skill assessment in critical fields setting a precedent for the broad application of DL across diverse real-life domains with limited data."
2301.00950,Class-Continuous Conditional Generative Neural Radiance Field,"The 3D-aware image synthesis focuses on conserving spatial consistency besides generating high-resolution images with fine details. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has been introduced for synthesizing novel views with low computational cost and superior performance. While several works investigate a generative NeRF and show remarkable achievement, they cannot handle conditional and continuous feature manipulation in the generation procedure. In this work, we introduce a novel model, called Class-Continuous Conditional Generative NeRF ($\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF), which can synthesize conditionally manipulated photorealistic 3D-consistent images by projecting conditional features to the generator and the discriminator. The proposed $\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF is evaluated with three image datasets, AFHQ, CelebA, and Cars. As a result, our model shows strong 3D-consistency with fine details and smooth interpolation in conditional feature manipulation. For instance, $\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF exhibits a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.64 in 3D-aware face image synthesis with a $\text{128}^{2}$ resolution. Additionally, we provide FIDs of generated 3D-aware images of each class of the datasets as it is possible to synthesize class-conditional images with $\text{C}^{3}$G-NeRF."
2301.00954,PanopticPartFormer++: A Unified and Decoupled View for Panoptic Part   Segmentation,"Panoptic Part Segmentation (PPS) unifies panoptic and part segmentation into one task. Previous works utilize separate approaches to handle things, stuff, and part predictions without shared computation and task association. We aim to unify these tasks at the architectural level, designing the first end-to-end unified framework, Panoptic-PartFormer. Moreover, we find the previous metric PartPQ biases to PQ. To handle both issues, we first design a meta-architecture that decouples part features and things/stuff features, respectively. We model things, stuff, and parts as object queries and directly learn to optimize all three forms of prediction as a unified mask prediction and classification problem. We term our model as Panoptic-PartFormer. Second, we propose a new metric Part-Whole Quality (PWQ), better to measure this task from pixel-region and part-whole perspectives. It also decouples the errors for part segmentation and panoptic segmentation. Third, inspired by Mask2Former, based on our meta-architecture, we propose Panoptic-PartFormer++ and design a new part-whole cross-attention scheme to boost part segmentation qualities further. We design a new part-whole interaction method using masked cross attention. Finally, extensive ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of both Panoptic-PartFormer and Panoptic-PartFormer++. Compared with previous Panoptic-PartFormer, our Panoptic-PartFormer++ achieves 2% PartPQ and 3% PWQ improvements on the Cityscapes PPS dataset and 5% PartPQ on the Pascal Context PPS dataset. On both datasets, Panoptic-PartFormer++ achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our models can serve as a strong baseline and aid future research in PPS. The source code and trained models will be available at~\url{https://github.com/lxtGH/Panoptic-PartFormer}."
2301.00970,Benchmarking the Robustness of LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Models,"When using LiDAR semantic segmentation models for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, it is essential to understand and improve their robustness with respect to a large range of LiDAR corruptions. In this paper, we aim to comprehensively analyze the robustness of LiDAR semantic segmentation models under various corruptions. To rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalizability of current approaches, we propose a new benchmark called SemanticKITTI-C, which features 16 out-of-domain LiDAR corruptions in three groups, namely adverse weather, measurement noise and cross-device discrepancy. Then, we systematically investigate 11 LiDAR semantic segmentation models, especially spanning different input representations (e.g., point clouds, voxels, projected images, and etc.), network architectures and training schemes. Through this study, we obtain two insights: 1) We find out that the input representation plays a crucial role in robustness. Specifically, under specific corruptions, different representations perform variously. 2) Although state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR semantic segmentation achieve promising results on clean data, they are less robust when dealing with noisy data. Finally, based on the above observations, we design a robust LiDAR segmentation model (RLSeg) which greatly boosts the robustness with simple but effective modifications. It is promising that our benchmark, comprehensive analysis, and observations can boost future research in robust LiDAR semantic segmentation for safety-critical applications."
2301.00973,Detecting Severity of Diabetic Retinopathy from Fundus Images: A   Transformer Network-based Review,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the significant concerns worldwide, primarily due to its impact on causing vision loss among most people with diabetes. The severity of DR is typically comprehended manually by ophthalmologists from fundus photography-based retina images. This paper deals with an automated understanding of the severity stages of DR. In the literature, researchers have focused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms and convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on essential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance. In this study, we adopt and fine-tune transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial features of retinal images for a more nuanced understanding of DR severity. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of image transformers to infer the degree of DR severity from fundus photographs. For experiments, we utilized the publicly available APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset, where the performances of the transformer-based models were quite encouraging."
2301.00985,DFME: A New Benchmark for Dynamic Facial Micro-expression Recognition,"One of the most important subconscious reactions, micro-expression (ME), is a spontaneous, subtle, and transient facial expression that reveals human beings' genuine emotion. Therefore, automatically recognizing ME (MER) is becoming increasingly crucial in the field of affective computing, providing essential technical support for lie detection, clinical psychological diagnosis, and public safety. However, the ME data scarcity has severely hindered the development of advanced data-driven MER models. Despite the recent efforts by several spontaneous ME databases to alleviate this problem, there is still a lack of sufficient data. Hence, in this paper, we overcome the ME data scarcity problem by collecting and annotating a dynamic spontaneous ME database with the largest current ME data scale called DFME (Dynamic Facial Micro-expressions). Specifically, the DFME database contains 7,526 well-labeled ME videos spanning multiple high frame rates, elicited by 671 participants and annotated by more than 20 professional annotators over three years. Furthermore, we comprehensively verify the created DFME, including using influential spatiotemporal video feature learning models and MER models as baselines, and conduct emotion classification and ME action unit classification experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the DFME database can facilitate research in automatic MER, and provide a new benchmark for this field. DFME will be published via https://mea-lab-421.github.io."
2301.01060,Knowledge-guided Causal Intervention for Weakly-supervised Object   Localization,"Previous weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) methods aim to expand activation map discriminative areas to cover the whole objects, yet neglect two inherent challenges when relying solely on image-level labels. First, the ``entangled context'' issue arises from object-context co-occurrence (\eg, fish and water), making the model inspection hard to distinguish object boundaries clearly. Second, the ``C-L dilemma'' issue results from the information decay caused by the pooling layers, which struggle to retain both the semantic information for precise classification and those essential details for accurate localization, leading to a trade-off in performance. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-guided causal intervention method, dubbed KG-CI-CAM, to address these two under-explored issues in one go. More specifically, we tackle the co-occurrence context confounder problem via causal intervention, which explores the causalities among image features, contexts, and categories to eliminate the biased object-context entanglement in the class activation maps. Based on the disentangled object feature, we introduce a multi-source knowledge guidance framework to strike a balance between absorbing classification knowledge and localization knowledge during model training. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KG-CI-CAM in learning distinct object boundaries amidst confounding contexts and mitigating the dilemma between classification and localization performance."
2301.01156,Reference Twice: A Simple and Unified Baseline for Few-Shot Instance   Segmentation,"Few-Shot Instance Segmentation (FSIS) requires detecting and segmenting novel classes with limited support examples. Existing methods based on Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) face two issues: 1) Overfitting suppresses novel class objects; 2) Dual-branch models require complex spatial correlation strategies to prevent spatial information loss when generating class prototypes. We introduce a unified framework, Reference Twice (RefT), to exploit the relationship between support and query features for FSIS and related tasks. Our three main contributions are: 1) A novel transformer-based baseline that avoids overfitting, offering a new direction for FSIS; 2) Demonstrating that support object queries encode key factors after base training, allowing query features to be enhanced twice at both feature and query levels using simple cross-attention, thus avoiding complex spatial correlation interaction; 3) Introducing a class-enhanced base knowledge distillation loss to address the issue of DETR-like models struggling with incremental settings due to the input projection layer, enabling easy extension to incremental FSIS. Extensive experimental evaluations on the COCO dataset under three FSIS settings demonstrate that our method performs favorably against existing approaches across different shots, \eg, $+8.2/+9.4$ performance gain over state-of-the-art methods with 10/30-shots. Source code and models will be available at https://github.com/hanyue1648/RefT."
2301.01200,Common Practices and Taxonomy in Deep Multi-view Fusion for Remote   Sensing Applications,"The advances in remote sensing technologies have boosted applications for Earth observation. These technologies provide multiple observations or views with different levels of information. They might contain static or temporary views with different levels of resolution, in addition to having different types and amounts of noise due to sensor calibration or deterioration. A great variety of deep learning models have been applied to fuse the information from these multiple views, known as deep multi-view or multi-modal fusion learning. However, the approaches in the literature vary greatly since different terminology is used to refer to similar concepts or different illustrations are given to similar techniques. This article gathers works on multi-view fusion for Earth observation by focusing on the common practices and approaches used in the literature. We summarize and structure insights from several different publications concentrating on unifying points and ideas. In this manuscript, we provide a harmonized terminology while at the same time mentioning the various alternative terms that are used in literature. The topics covered by the works reviewed focus on supervised learning with the use of neural network models. We hope this review, with a long list of recent references, can support future research and lead to a unified advance in the area."
2301.01490,Towards a Pipeline for Real-Time Visualization of Faces for VR-based   Telepresence and Live Broadcasting Utilizing Neural Rendering,"While head-mounted displays (HMDs) for Virtual Reality (VR) have become widely available in the consumer market, they pose a considerable obstacle for a realistic face-to-face conversation in VR since HMDs hide a significant portion of the participants faces. Even with image streams from cameras directly attached to an HMD, stitching together a convincing image of an entire face remains a challenging task because of extreme capture angles and strong lens distortions due to a wide field of view. Compared to the long line of research in VR, reconstruction of faces hidden beneath an HMD is a very recent topic of research. While the current state-of-the-art solutions demonstrate photo-realistic 3D reconstruction results, they require high-cost laboratory equipment and large computational costs. We present an approach that focuses on low-cost hardware and can be used on a commodity gaming computer with a single GPU. We leverage the benefits of an end-to-end pipeline by means of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our GAN produces a frontal-facing 2.5D point cloud based on a training dataset captured with an RGBD camera. In our approach, the training process is offline, while the reconstruction runs in real-time. Our results show adequate reconstruction quality within the 'learned' expressions. Expressions not learned by the network produce artifacts and can trigger the Uncanny Valley effect."
2301.01732,Explicit Abnormality Extraction for Unsupervised Motion Artifact   Reduction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Motion artifacts compromise the quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pose challenges to achieving diagnostic outcomes and image-guided therapies. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches have emerged as successful solutions for motion artifact reduction (MAR). One disadvantage of these methods is their dependency on acquiring paired sets of motion artifact-corrupted (MA-corrupted) and motion artifact-free (MA-free) MR images for training purposes. Obtaining such image pairs is difficult and therefore limits the application of supervised training. In this paper, we propose a novel UNsupervised Abnormality Extraction Network (UNAEN) to alleviate this problem. Our network is capable of working with unpaired MA-corrupted and MA-free images. It converts the MA-corrupted images to MA-reduced images by extracting abnormalities from the MA-corrupted images using a proposed artifact extractor, which intercepts the residual artifact maps from the MA-corrupted MR images explicitly, and a reconstructor to restore the original input from the MA-reduced images. The performance of UNAEN was assessed by experimenting with various publicly available MRI datasets and comparing them with state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of UNAEN over alternative MAR methods and visually exhibits fewer residual artifacts. Our results substantiate the potential of UNAEN as a promising solution applicable in real-world clinical environments, with the capability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate image-guided therapies. Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/YuSheng-Zhou/UNAEN."
2301.01917,Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on   Motion Information,"A Flying Bird Object Detection algorithm Based on Motion Information (FBOD-BMI) is proposed to solve the problem that the features of the object are not obvious in a single frame, and the size of the object is small (low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)) in surveillance video. Firstly, a ConvLSTM-PAN model structure is designed to capture suspicious flying bird objects, in which the Convolutional Long and Short Time Memory (ConvLSTM) network aggregated the Spatio-temporal features of the flying bird object on adjacent multi-frame before the input of the model and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) located the suspicious flying bird objects. Then, an object tracking algorithm is used to track suspicious flying bird objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same time, the size of the MR of the suspicious flying bird object is adjusted adaptively according to its speed of movement (specifically, if the bird moves slowly, its MR will be expanded according to the speed of the bird to ensure the environmental information needed to detect the flying bird object). Adaptive Spatio-temporal Cubes (ASt-Cubes) of the flying bird objects are generated to ensure that the SNR of the flying bird objects is improved, and the necessary environmental information is retained adaptively. Finally, a LightWeight U-Shape Net (LW-USN) based on ASt-Cubes is designed to detect flying bird objects, which rejects the false detections of the suspicious flying bird objects and returns the position of the real flying bird objects. The monitoring video including the flying birds is collected in the unattended traction substation as the experimental dataset to verify the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the flying bird object detection method based on motion information proposed in this paper can effectively detect the flying bird object in surveillance video."
2301.01940,Enabling Augmented Segmentation and Registration in Ultrasound-Guided   Spinal Surgery via Realistic Ultrasound Synthesis from Diagnostic CT Volume,"This paper aims to tackle the issues on unavailable or insufficient clinical US data and meaningful annotation to enable bone segmentation and registration for US-guided spinal surgery. While the US is not a standard paradigm for spinal surgery, the scarcity of intra-operative clinical US data is an insurmountable bottleneck in training a neural network. Moreover, due to the characteristics of US imaging, it is difficult to clearly annotate bone surfaces which causes the trained neural network missing its attention to the details. Hence, we propose an In silico bone US simulation framework that synthesizes realistic US images from diagnostic CT volume. Afterward, using these simulated bone US we train a lightweight vision transformer model that can achieve accurate and on-the-fly bone segmentation for spinal sonography. In the validation experiments, the realistic US simulation was conducted by deriving from diagnostic spinal CT volume to facilitate a radiation-free US-guided pedicle screw placement procedure. When it is employed for training bone segmentation task, the Chamfer distance achieves 0.599mm; when it is applied for CT-US registration, the associated bone segmentation accuracy achieves 0.93 in Dice, and the registration accuracy based on the segmented point cloud is 0.13~3.37mm in a complication-free manner. While bone US images exhibit strong echoes at the medium interface, it may enable the model indistinguishable between thin interfaces and bone surfaces by simply relying on small neighborhood information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to utilize a Long-range Contrast Learning Module to fully explore the Long-range Contrast between the candidates and their surrounding pixels."
2301.01955,Adaptively Clustering Neighbor Elements for Image-Text Generation,"We propose a novel Transformer-based image-to-text generation model termed as \textbf{ACF} that adaptively clusters vision patches into object regions and language words into phrases to implicitly learn object-phrase alignments for better visual-text coherence. To achieve this, we design a novel self-attention layer that applies self-attention over the elements in a local cluster window instead of the whole sequence. The window size is softly decided by a clustering matrix that is calculated by the current input data and thus this process is adaptive. By stacking these revised self-attention layers to construct ACF, the small clusters in the lower layers can be grouped into a bigger cluster, \eg vision/language. ACF clusters small objects/phrases into bigger ones. In this gradual clustering process, a parsing tree is generated which embeds the hierarchical knowledge of the input sequence. As a result, by using ACF to build the vision encoder and language decoder, the hierarchical object-phrase alignments are embedded and then transferred from vision to language domains in two popular image-to-text tasks: Image captioning and Visual Question Answering. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACF, which outperforms most SOTA captioning and VQA models and achieves comparable scores compared with some large-scale pre-trained models. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/ZihuaEvan/ACFModel/}{[here]}."
2301.02008,Expressive Speech-driven Facial Animation with controllable emotions,"It is in high demand to generate facial animation with high realism, but it remains a challenging task. Existing approaches of speech-driven facial animation can produce satisfactory mouth movement and lip synchronization, but show weakness in dramatic emotional expressions and flexibility in emotion control. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for expressive facial animation generation from speech that can exhibit wide-spectrum facial expressions with controllable emotion type and intensity. We propose an emotion controller module to learn the relationship between the emotion variations (e.g., types and intensity) and the corresponding facial expression parameters. It enables emotion-controllable facial animation, where the target expression can be continuously adjusted as desired. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the animation generated by our method is rich in facial emotional expressiveness while retaining accurate lip movement, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods."
2301.02069,Deep Learning for Breast MRI Style Transfer with Limited Training Data,"In this work we introduce a novel medical image style transfer method, StyleMapper, that can transfer medical scans to an unseen style with access to limited training data. This is made possible by training our model on unlimited possibilities of simulated random medical imaging styles on the training set, making our work more computationally efficient when compared with other style transfer methods. Moreover, our method enables arbitrary style transfer: transferring images to styles unseen in training. This is useful for medical imaging, where images are acquired using different protocols and different scanner models, resulting in a variety of styles that data may need to be transferred between. Methods: Our model disentangles image content from style and can modify an image's style by simply replacing the style encoding with one extracted from a single image of the target style, with no additional optimization required. This also allows the model to distinguish between different styles of images, including among those that were unseen in training. We propose a formal description of the proposed model. Results: Experimental results on breast magnetic resonance images indicate the effectiveness of our method for style transfer. Conclusion: Our style transfer method allows for the alignment of medical images taken with different scanners into a single unified style dataset, allowing for the training of other downstream tasks on such a dataset for tasks such as classification, object detection and others."
2301.02160,ANNA: Abstractive Text-to-Image Synthesis with Filtered News Captions,"Advancements in Text-to-Image synthesis over recent years have focused more on improving the quality of generated samples using datasets with descriptive prompts. However, real-world image-caption pairs present in domains such as news data do not use simple and directly descriptive captions. With captions containing information on both the image content and underlying contextual cues, they become abstractive in nature. In this paper, we launch ANNA, an Abstractive News captioNs dAtaset extracted from online news articles in a variety of different contexts. We explore the capabilities of current Text-to-Image synthesis models to generate news domain-specific images using abstractive captions by benchmarking them on ANNA, in both standard training and transfer learning settings. The generated images are judged on the basis of contextual relevance, visual quality, and perceptual similarity to ground-truth image-caption pairs. Through our experiments, we show that techniques such as transfer learning achieve limited success in understanding abstractive captions but still fail to consistently learn the relationships between content and context features. The Dataset is available at https://github.com/aashish2000/ANNA ."
2301.02268,Restarts subject to approximate sharpness: A parameter-free and optimal   scheme for first-order methods,"Sharpness is an almost generic assumption in continuous optimization that bounds the distance from minima by objective function suboptimality. It facilitates the acceleration of first-order methods through restarts. However, sharpness involves problem-specific constants that are typically unknown, and restart schemes typically reduce convergence rates. Moreover, these schemes are challenging to apply in the presence of noise or with approximate model classes (e.g., in compressive imaging or learning problems), and they generally assume that the first-order method used produces feasible iterates. We consider the assumption of approximate sharpness, a generalization of sharpness that incorporates an unknown constant perturbation to the objective function error. This constant offers greater robustness (e.g., with respect to noise or relaxation of model classes) for finding approximate minimizers. By employing a new type of search over the unknown constants, we design a restart scheme that applies to general first-order methods and does not require the first-order method to produce feasible iterates. Our scheme maintains the same convergence rate as when the constants are known. The convergence rates we achieve for various first-order methods match the optimal rates or improve on previously established rates for a wide range of problems. We showcase our restart scheme in several examples and highlight potential future applications and developments of our framework and theory."
2301.02310,PressureVision++: Estimating Fingertip Pressure from Diverse RGB Images,"Touch plays a fundamental role in manipulation for humans; however, machine perception of contact and pressure typically requires invasive sensors. Recent research has shown that deep models can estimate hand pressure based on a single RGB image. However, evaluations have been limited to controlled settings since collecting diverse data with ground-truth pressure measurements is difficult. We present a novel approach that enables diverse data to be captured with only an RGB camera and a cooperative participant. Our key insight is that people can be prompted to apply pressure in a certain way, and this prompt can serve as a weak label to supervise models to perform well under varied conditions. We collect a novel dataset with 51 participants making fingertip contact with diverse objects. Our network, PressureVision++, outperforms human annotators and prior work. We also demonstrate an application of PressureVision++ to mixed reality where pressure estimation allows everyday surfaces to be used as arbitrary touch-sensitive interfaces. Code, data, and models are available online."
2301.02315,TempSAL -- Uncovering Temporal Information for Deep Saliency Prediction,"Deep saliency prediction algorithms complement the object recognition features, they typically rely on additional information, such as scene context, semantic relationships, gaze direction, and object dissimilarity. However, none of these models consider the temporal nature of gaze shifts during image observation. We introduce a novel saliency prediction model that learns to output saliency maps in sequential time intervals by exploiting human temporal attention patterns. Our approach locally modulates the saliency predictions by combining the learned temporal maps. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including a multi-duration saliency model, on the SALICON benchmark. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub."
2301.02608,An interpretable machine learning system for colorectal cancer diagnosis   from pathology slides,"Considering the profound transformation affecting pathology practice, we aimed to develop a scalable artificial intelligence (AI) system to diagnose colorectal cancer from whole-slide images (WSI). For this, we propose a deep learning (DL) system that learns from weak labels, a sampling strategy that reduces the number of training samples by a factor of six without compromising performance, an approach to leverage a small subset of fully annotated samples, and a prototype with explainable predictions, active learning features and parallelisation. Noting some problems in the literature, this study is conducted with one of the largest WSI colorectal samples dataset with approximately 10,500 WSIs. Of these samples, 900 are testing samples. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed method is assessed with two additional external datasets (TCGA and PAIP) and a dataset of samples collected directly from the proposed prototype. Our proposed method predicts, for the patch-based tiles, a class based on the severity of the dysplasia and uses that information to classify the whole slide. It is trained with an interpretable mixed-supervision scheme to leverage the domain knowledge introduced by pathologists through spatial annotations. The mixed-supervision scheme allowed for an intelligent sampling strategy effectively evaluated in several different scenarios without compromising the performance. On the internal dataset, the method shows an accuracy of 93.44% and a sensitivity between positive (low-grade and high-grade dysplasia) and non-neoplastic samples of 0.996. On the external test samples varied with TCGA being the most challenging dataset with an overall accuracy of 84.91% and a sensitivity of 0.996."
2301.02650,Hierarchical Point Attention for Indoor 3D Object Detection,"3D object detection is an essential vision technique for various robotic systems, such as augmented reality and domestic robots. Transformers as versatile network architectures have recently seen great success in 3D point cloud object detection. However, the lack of hierarchy in a plain transformer restrains its ability to learn features at different scales. Such limitation makes transformer detectors perform worse on smaller objects and affects their reliability in indoor environments where small objects are the majority. This work proposes two novel attention operations as generic hierarchical designs for point-based transformer detectors. First, we propose Aggregated Multi-Scale Attention (MS-A) that builds multi-scale tokens from a single-scale input feature to enable more fine-grained feature learning. Second, we propose Size-Adaptive Local Attention (Local-A) with adaptive attention regions for localized feature aggregation within bounding box proposals. Both attention operations are model-agnostic network modules that can be plugged into existing point cloud transformers for end-to-end training. We evaluate our method on two widely used indoor detection benchmarks. By plugging our proposed modules into the state-of-the-art transformer-based 3D detectors, we improve the previous best results on both benchmarks, with more significant improvements on smaller objects."
2301.03182,Structure-Informed Shadow Removal Networks,"Existing deep learning-based shadow removal methods still produce images with shadow remnants. These shadow remnants typically exist in homogeneous regions with low-intensity values, making them untraceable in the existing image-to-image mapping paradigm. We observe that shadows mainly degrade images at the image-structure level (in which humans perceive object shapes and continuous colors). Hence, in this paper, we propose to remove shadows at the image structure level. Based on this idea, we propose a novel structure-informed shadow removal network (StructNet) to leverage the image-structure information to address the shadow remnant problem. Specifically, StructNet first reconstructs the structure information of the input image without shadows and then uses the restored shadow-free structure prior to guiding the image-level shadow removal. StructNet contains two main novel modules: (1) a mask-guided shadow-free extraction (MSFE) module to extract image structural features in a non-shadow-to-shadow directional manner, and (2) a multi-scale feature & residual aggregation (MFRA) module to leverage the shadow-free structure information to regularize feature consistency. In addition, we also propose to extend StructNet to exploit multi-level structure information (MStructNet), to further boost the shadow removal performance with minimum computational overheads. Extensive experiments on three shadow removal benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing shadow removal methods, and our StructNet can be integrated with existing methods to improve them further."
2301.03331,A Specific Task-oriented Semantic Image Communication System for   substation patrol inspection,"Intelligent inspection robots are widely used in substation patrol inspection, which can help check potential safety hazards by patrolling the substation and sending back scene images. However, when patrolling some marginal areas with weak signal, the scene images cannot be sucessfully transmissted to be used for hidden danger elimination, which greatly reduces the quality of robots'daily work. To solve such problem, a Specific Task-oriented Semantic Communication System for Imag-STSCI is designed, which involves the semantic features extraction, transmission, restoration and enhancement to get clearer images sent by intelligent robots under weak signals. Inspired by that only some specific details of the image are needed in such substation patrol inspection task, we proposed a new paradigm of semantic enhancement in such specific task to ensure the clarity of key semantic information when facing a lower bit rate or a low signal-to-noise ratio situation. Across the reality-based simulation, experiments show our STSCI can generally surpass traditional image-compression-based and channel-codingbased or other semantic communication system in the substation patrol inspection task with a lower bit rate even under a low signal-to-noise ratio situation."
2301.03432,Multi-Modal and Multi-Resolution Data Fusion for High-Resolution Cloud   Removal: A Novel Baseline and Benchmark,"Cloud removal is a significant and challenging problem in remote sensing, and in recent years, there have been notable advancements in this area. However, two major issues remain hindering the development of cloud removal: the unavailability of high-resolution imagery for existing datasets and the absence of evaluation regarding the semantic meaningfulness of the generated structures. In this paper, we introduce M3R-CR, a benchmark dataset for high-resolution Cloud Removal with Multi-Modal and Multi-Resolution data fusion. With this dataset, we consider the problem of cloud removal in high-resolution optical remote sensing imagery by integrating multi-modal and multi-resolution information. In this context, we have to take into account the alignment errors caused by the multi-resolution nature, along with the more pronounced misalignment issues in high-resolution images due to inherent imaging mechanism differences and other factors. Existing multi-modal data fusion based methods, which assume the image pairs are aligned accurately at pixel-level, are thus not appropriate for this problem. To this end, we design a new baseline named Align-CR to perform the low-resolution SAR image guided high-resolution optical image cloud removal. It gradually warps and fuses the features of the multi-modal and multi-resolution data during the reconstruction process, effectively mitigating concerns associated with misalignment. In the experiments, we evaluate the performance of cloud removal by analyzing the quality of visually pleasing textures using image reconstruction metrics and further analyze the generation of semantically meaningful structures using a well-established semantic segmentation task. The proposed Align-CR method is superior to other baseline methods in both areas."
2301.03553,FedDebug: Systematic Debugging for Federated Learning Applications,"In Federated Learning (FL), clients independently train local models and share them with a central aggregator to build a global model. Impermissibility to access clients' data and collaborative training make FL appealing for applications with data-privacy concerns, such as medical imaging. However, these FL characteristics pose unprecedented challenges for debugging. When a global model's performance deteriorates, identifying the responsible rounds and clients is a major pain point. Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with subsets of clients, hoping to increase the global model's accuracy or let future FL rounds retune the model, which are time-consuming and costly.   We design a systematic fault localization framework, FedDebug, that advances the FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, FedDebug enables interactive debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's breakpoint can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model) and move between rounds and clients' models seamlessly, enabling a fine-grained step-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client(s) responsible for lowering the global model's performance without any testing data and labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques. FedDebug's strengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neuron activations to determine the client(s) deviating from normal behavior. FedDebug achieves 100% accuracy in finding a single faulty client and 90.3% accuracy in finding multiple faulty clients. FedDebug's interactive debugging incurs 1.2% overhead during training, while it localizes a faulty client in only 2.1% of a round's training time."
2301.03701,Artificial Intelligence Model for Tumoral Clinical Decision Support   Systems,"Comparative diagnostic in brain tumor evaluation makes possible to use the available information of a medical center to compare similar cases when a new patient is evaluated. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence models, the proposed system is able of retrieving the most similar cases of brain tumors for a given query. The primary objective is to enhance the diagnostic process by generating more accurate representations of medical images, with a particular focus on patient-specific normal features and pathologies. The proposed model uses Artificial Intelligence to detect patient features to recommend the most similar cases from a database. The system not only suggests similar cases but also balances the representation of healthy and abnormal features in its design. This not only encourages the generalization of its use but also aids clinicians in their decision-making processes. We conducted a comparative analysis of our approach in relation to similar studies. The proposed architecture obtains a Dice coefficient of 0.474 in both tumoral and healthy regions of the patients, which outperforms previous literature. Our proposed model excels at extracting and combining anatomical and pathological features from brain \glspl{mr}, achieving state-of-the-art results while relying on less expensive label information. This substantially reduces the overall cost of the training process. This paper provides substantial grounds for further exploration of the broader applicability and optimization of the proposed architecture to enhance clinical decision-making. The novel approach presented in this work marks a significant advancement in the field of medical diagnosis, particularly in the context of Artificial Intelligence-assisted image retrieval, and promises to reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care using Artificial Intelligence as a support tool instead of a black box system."
2301.03767,Metric Compatible Training for Online Backfilling in Large-Scale   Retrieval,"Backfilling is the process of re-extracting all gallery embeddings from upgraded models in image retrieval systems. It inevitably requires a prohibitively large amount of computational cost and even entails the downtime of the service. Although backward-compatible learning sidesteps this challenge by tackling query-side representations, this leads to suboptimal solutions in principle because gallery embeddings cannot benefit from model upgrades. We address this dilemma by introducing an online backfilling algorithm, which enables us to achieve a progressive performance improvement during the backfilling process while not sacrificing the final performance of new model after the completion of backfilling. To this end, we first propose a simple distance rank merge technique for online backfilling. Then, we incorporate a reverse transformation module for more effective and efficient merging, which is further enhanced by adopting a metric-compatible contrastive learning approach. These two components help to make the distances of old and new models compatible, resulting in desirable merge results during backfilling with no extra computational overhead. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our framework on four standard benchmarks in various settings."
2301.03796,Enhancing Evaluation Methods for Infrared Small-Target Detection in   Real-world Scenarios,"Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses a significant challenge in the field of computer vision. While substantial efforts have been made over the past two decades to improve the detection capabilities of IRSTD algorithms, there has been a lack of extensive investigation into the evaluation metrics used for assessing their performance. In this paper, we employ a systematic approach to address this issue by first evaluating the effectiveness of existing metrics and then proposing new metrics to overcome the limitations of conventional ones. To achieve this, we carefully analyze the necessary conditions for successful detection and identify the shortcomings of current evaluation metrics, including both pre-thresholding and post-thresholding metrics. We then introduce new metrics that are designed to align with the requirements of real-world systems. Furthermore, we utilize these newly proposed metrics to compare and evaluate the performance of five widely recognized small infrared target detection algorithms. The results demonstrate that the new metrics provide consistent and meaningful quantitative assessments, aligning with qualitative observations."
2301.04218,Leveraging Diffusion For Strong and High Quality Face Morphing Attacks,"Face morphing attacks seek to deceive a Face Recognition (FR) system by presenting a morphed image consisting of the biometric qualities from two different identities with the aim of triggering a false acceptance with one of the two identities, thereby presenting a significant threat to biometric systems. The success of a morphing attack is dependent on the ability of the morphed image to represent the biometric characteristics of both identities that were used to create the image. We present a novel morphing attack that uses a Diffusion-based architecture to improve the visual fidelity of the image and the ability of the morphing attack to represent characteristics from both identities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack by evaluating its visual fidelity via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Also, extensive experiments are conducted to measure the vulnerability of FR systems to the proposed attack. The ability of a morphing attack detector to detect the proposed attack is measured and compared against two state-of-the-art GAN-based morphing attacks along with two Landmark-based attacks. Additionally, a novel metric to measure the relative strength between different morphing attacks is introduced and evaluated."
2301.04470,InstaGraM: Instance-level Graph Modeling for Vectorized HD Map Learning,"For scalable autonomous driving, a robust map-based localization system, independent of GPS, is fundamental. To achieve such map-based localization, online high-definition (HD) map construction plays a significant role in accurate estimation of the pose. Although recent advancements in online HD map construction have predominantly investigated on vectorized representation due to its effectiveness, they suffer from computational cost and fixed parametric model, which limit scalability. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel HD map learning framework that leverages graph modeling. This framework is designed to learn the construction of diverse geometric shapes, thereby enhancing the scalability of HD map construction. Our approach involves representing the map elements as an instance-level graph by decomposing them into vertices and edges to facilitate accurate and efficient end-to-end vectorized HD map learning. Furthermore, we introduce an association strategy using a Graph Neural Network to efficiently handle the complex geometry of various map elements, while maintaining scalability. Comprehensive experiments on public open dataset show that our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art model by $1.6$ mAP. We further showcase the superior scalability of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a $4.8$ mAP improvement in long range configuration. Our code is available at https://github.com/juyebshin/InstaGraM."
2301.04494,Multi-label Image Classification using Adaptive Graph Convolutional   Networks: from a Single Domain to Multiple Domains,"This paper proposes an adaptive graph-based approach for multi-label image classification. Graph-based methods have been largely exploited in the field of multi-label classification, given their ability to model label correlations. Specifically, their effectiveness has been proven not only when considering a single domain but also when taking into account multiple domains. However, the topology of the used graph is not optimal as it is pre-defined heuristically. In addition, consecutive Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) aggregations tend to destroy the feature similarity. To overcome these issues, an architecture for learning the graph connectivity in an end-to-end fashion is introduced. This is done by integrating an attention-based mechanism and a similarity-preserving strategy. The proposed framework is then extended to multiple domains using an adversarial training scheme. Numerous experiments are reported on well-known single-domain and multi-domain benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and model size as compared to the state-of-the-art. The code will be made publicly available."
2301.04497,Dynamic Background Reconstruction via MAE for Infrared Small Target   Detection,"Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds is a difficult problem, for the differences between targets and backgrounds are not easy to distinguish. Background reconstruction is one of the methods to deal with this problem. This paper proposes an ISTD method based on background reconstruction called Dynamic Background Reconstruction (DBR). DBR consists of three modules: a dynamic shift window module (DSW), a background reconstruction module (BR), and a detection head (DH). BR takes advantage of Vision Transformers in reconstructing missing patches and adopts a grid masking strategy with a masking ratio of 50\% to reconstruct clean backgrounds without targets. To avoid dividing one target into two neighboring patches, resulting in reconstructing failure, DSW is performed before input embedding. DSW calculates offsets, according to which infrared images dynamically shift. To reduce False Positive (FP) cases caused by regarding reconstruction errors as targets, DH utilizes a structure of densely connected Transformer to further improve the detection performance. Experimental results show that DBR achieves the best F1-score on the two ISTD datasets, MFIRST (64.10\%) and SIRST (75.01\%)."
2301.04517,A new dataset for measuring the performance of blood vessel segmentation   methods under distribution shifts,"Creating a dataset for training supervised machine learning algorithms can be a demanding task. This is especially true for medical image segmentation since one or more specialists are usually required for image annotation, and creating ground truth labels for just a single image can take up to several hours. In addition, it is paramount that the annotated samples represent well the different conditions that might affect the imaged tissues as well as possible changes in the image acquisition process. This can only be achieved by considering samples that are typical in the dataset as well as atypical, or even outlier, samples. We introduce VessMAP, a heterogeneous blood vessel segmentation dataset acquired by carefully sampling relevant images from a larger non-annotated dataset. A methodology was developed to select both prototypical and atypical samples from the base dataset, thus defining an assorted set of images that can be used for measuring the performance of segmentation algorithms on samples that are highly distinct from each other. To demonstrate the potential of the new dataset, we show that the validation performance of a neural network changes significantly depending on the splits used for training the network."
2301.04558,Learning to Exploit Temporal Structure for Biomedical Vision-Language   Processing,"Self-supervised learning in vision-language processing exploits semantic alignment between imaging and text modalities. Prior work in biomedical VLP has mostly relied on the alignment of single image and report pairs even though clinical notes commonly refer to prior images. This does not only introduce poor alignment between the modalities but also a missed opportunity to exploit rich self-supervision through existing temporal content in the data. In this work, we explicitly account for prior images and reports when available during both training and fine-tuning. Our approach, named BioViL-T, uses a CNN-Transformer hybrid multi-image encoder trained jointly with a text model. It is designed to be versatile to arising challenges such as pose variations and missing input images across time. The resulting model excels on downstream tasks both in single- and multi-image setups, achieving state-of-the-art performance on (I) progression classification, (II) phrase grounding, and (III) report generation, whilst offering consistent improvements on disease classification and sentence-similarity tasks. We release a novel multi-modal temporal benchmark dataset, MS-CXR-T, to quantify the quality of vision-language representations in terms of temporal semantics. Our experimental results show the advantages of incorporating prior images and reports to make most use of the data."
2301.04584,Continual HyperTransformer: A Meta-Learner for Continual Few-Shot   Learning,"We focus on the problem of learning without forgetting from multiple tasks arriving sequentially, where each task is defined using a few-shot episode of novel or already seen classes. We approach this problem using the recently published HyperTransformer (HT), a Transformer-based hypernetwork that generates specialized task-specific CNN weights directly from the support set. In order to learn from a continual sequence of tasks, we propose to recursively re-use the generated weights as input to the HT for the next task. This way, the generated CNN weights themselves act as a representation of previously learned tasks, and the HT is trained to update these weights so that the new task can be learned without forgetting past tasks. This approach is different from most continual learning algorithms that typically rely on using replay buffers, weight regularization or task-dependent architectural changes. We demonstrate that our proposed Continual HyperTransformer method equipped with a prototypical loss is capable of learning and retaining knowledge about past tasks for a variety of scenarios, including learning from mini-batches, and task-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios."
2301.04612,Self-Supervised Generative-Contrastive Learning of Multi-Modal Euclidean Input for 3D Shape Latent Representations: A Dynamic Switching Approach,"We propose a combined generative and contrastive neural architecture for learning latent representations of 3D volumetric shapes. The architecture uses two encoder branches for voxel grids and multi-view images from the same underlying shape. The main idea is to combine a contrastive loss between the resulting latent representations with an additional reconstruction loss. That helps to avoid collapsing the latent representations as a trivial solution for minimizing the contrastive loss. A novel dynamic switching approach is used to cross-train two encoders with a shared decoder. The switching approach also enables the stop gradient operation on a random branch. Further classification experiments show that the latent representations learned with our self-supervised method integrate more useful information from the additional input data implicitly, thus leading to better reconstruction and classification performance."
2301.04628,Image-to-Image Translation with Disentangled Latent Vectors for Face   Editing,"We propose an image-to-image translation framework for facial attribute editing with disentangled interpretable latent directions. Facial attribute editing task faces the challenges of targeted attribute editing with controllable strength and disentanglement in the representations of attributes to preserve the other attributes during edits. For this goal, inspired by the latent space factorization works of fixed pretrained GANs, we design the attribute editing by latent space factorization, and for each attribute, we learn a linear direction that is orthogonal to the others. We train these directions with orthogonality constraints and disentanglement losses. To project images to semantically organized latent spaces, we set an encoder-decoder architecture with attention-based skip connections. We extensively compare with previous image translation algorithms and editing with pretrained GAN works. Our extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves over the state-of-the-arts."
2301.04634,Street-View Image Generation from a Bird's-Eye View Layout,"Bird's-Eye View (BEV) Perception has received increasing attention in recent years as it provides a concise and unified spatial representation across views and benefits a diverse set of downstream driving applications. At the same time, data-driven simulation for autonomous driving has been a focal point of recent research but with few approaches that are both fully data-driven and controllable. Instead of using perception data from real-life scenarios, an ideal model for simulation would generate realistic street-view images that align with a given HD map and traffic layout, a task that is critical for visualizing complex traffic scenarios and developing robust perception models for autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose BEVGen, a conditional generative model that synthesizes a set of realistic and spatially consistent surrounding images that match the BEV layout of a traffic scenario. BEVGen incorporates a novel cross-view transformation with spatial attention design which learns the relationship between cameras and map views to ensure their consistency. We evaluate the proposed model on the challenging NuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets. After training, BEVGen can accurately render road and lane lines, as well as generate traffic scenes with diverse different weather conditions and times of day."
2301.04811,Deformation measurement of a soil mixing retaining wall using   terrestrial laser scanning,"Retaining walls are often built to prevent excessive lateral movements of the ground surrounding an excavation site. During an excavation, failure of retaining walls could cause catastrophic accidents and hence their lateral deformations are monitored regularly. Laser scanning can rapidly acquire the spatial data of a relatively large area at fine spatial resolutions, which is ideal for monitoring retaining walls' deformations. This paper attempts to apply laser scanning to measurements of the lateral deformations of a soil mixing retaining wall at an ongoing excavation site. Reference measurements by total station and inclinometer were also conducted to verify those from the laser scanning. The deformations derived using laser scanning data were consistent with the reference measurements at the top part of the retaining wall (i.e., mainly the ring beam of the wall). This research also shows that the multi-scale-model-to-model method was the most accurate deformation estimation method on the research data."
2301.05158,SemPPL: Predicting pseudo-labels for better contrastive representations,"Learning from large amounts of unsupervised data and a small amount of supervision is an important open problem in computer vision. We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning -- where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) -- with a novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones through a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to even better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of $68.5\%$ and $76\%$ top-$1$ accuracy when using a ResNet-$50$ and training on $1\%$ and $10\%$ of labels on ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SemPPL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving $72.3\%$ and $78.3\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet with $1\%$ and $10\%$ labels, respectively, which improves absolute $+7.8\%$ and $+6.2\%$ over previous work. SemPPL also exhibits state-of-the-art performance over larger ResNet models as well as strong robustness, out-of-distribution and transfer performance. We release the checkpoints and the evaluation code at https://github.com/deepmind/semppl ."
2301.05180,Effective Decision Boundary Learning for Class Incremental Learning,"Rehearsal approaches in class incremental learning (CIL) suffer from decision boundary overfitting to new classes, which is mainly caused by two factors: insufficiency of old classes data for knowledge distillation and imbalanced data learning between the learned and new classes because of the limited storage memory. In this work, we present a simple but effective approach to tackle these two factors. First, we employ a re-sampling strategy and Mixup K}nowledge D}istillation (Re-MKD) to improve the performances of KD, which would greatly alleviate the overfitting problem. Specifically, we combine mixup and re-sampling strategies to synthesize adequate data used in KD training that are more consistent with the latent distribution between the learned and new classes. Second, we propose a novel incremental influence balance (IIB) method for CIL to tackle the classification of imbalanced data by extending the influence balance method into the CIL setting, which re-weights samples by their influences to create a proper decision boundary. With these two improvements, we present the effective decision boundary learning algorithm (EDBL) which improves the performance of KD and deals with the imbalanced data learning simultaneously. Experiments show that the proposed EDBL achieves state-of-the-art performances on several CIL benchmarks."
2301.05191,A Unified Framework for Event-based Frame Interpolation with Ad-hoc Deblurring in the Wild,"Effective video frame interpolation hinges on the adept handling of motion in the input scene. Prior work acknowledges asynchronous event information for this, but often overlooks whether motion induces blur in the video, limiting its scope to sharp frame interpolation. We instead propose a unified framework for event-based frame interpolation that performs deblurring ad-hoc and thus works both on sharp and blurry input videos. Our model consists in a bidirectional recurrent network that incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity. To enhance the generalization from synthetic data to real event cameras, we integrate self-supervised framework with the proposed model to enhance the generalization on real-world datasets in the wild. At the dataset level, we introduce a novel real-world high-resolution dataset with events and color videos named HighREV, which provides a challenging evaluation setting for the examined task. Extensive experiments show that our network consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on frame interpolation, single image deblurring, and the joint task of both. Experiments on domain transfer reveal that self-supervised training effectively mitigates the performance degradation observed when transitioning from synthetic data to real-world data. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/AHupuJR/REFID."
2301.05246,Online Class-Incremental Learning For Real-World Food Image   Classification,"Food image classification is essential for monitoring health and tracking dietary in image-based dietary assessment methods. However, conventional systems often rely on static datasets with fixed classes and uniform distribution. In contrast, real-world food consumption patterns, shaped by cultural, economic, and personal influences, involve dynamic and evolving data. Thus, require the classification system to cope with continuously evolving data. Online Class Incremental Learning (OCIL) addresses the challenge of learning continuously from a single-pass data stream while adapting to the new knowledge and reducing catastrophic forgetting. Experience Replay (ER) based OCIL methods store a small portion of previous data and have shown encouraging performance. However, most existing OCIL works assume that the distribution of encountered data is perfectly balanced, which rarely happens in real-world scenarios. In this work, we explore OCIL for real-world food image classification by first introducing a probabilistic framework to simulate realistic food consumption scenarios. Subsequently, we present an attachable Dynamic Model Update (DMU) module designed for existing ER methods, which enables the selection of relevant images for model training, addressing challenges arising from data repetition and imbalanced sample occurrences inherent in realistic food consumption patterns within the OCIL framework. Our performance evaluation demonstrates significant enhancements compared to established ER methods, showing great potential for lifelong learning in real-world food image classification scenarios. The code of our method is publicly accessible at https://gitlab.com/viper-purdue/OCIL-real-world-food-image-classification"
2301.05994,Min-Max-Jump distance and its applications,"We explore three applications of Min-Max-Jump distance (MMJ distance). MMJ-based K-means revises K-means with MMJ distance. MMJ-based Silhouette coefficient revises Silhouette coefficient with MMJ distance. We also tested the Clustering with Neural Network and Index (CNNI) model with MMJ-based Silhouette coefficient. In the last application, we tested using Min-Max-Jump distance for predicting labels of new points, after a clustering analysis of data. Result shows Min-Max-Jump distance achieves good performances in all the three proposed applications. In addition, we devise several algorithms for calculating or estimating the distance."
2301.05997,Exploiting Auxiliary Caption for Video Grounding,"Video grounding aims to locate a moment of interest matching the given query sentence from an untrimmed video. Previous works ignore the {sparsity dilemma} in video annotations, which fails to provide the context information between potential events and query sentences in the dataset. In this paper, we contend that exploiting easily available captions which describe general actions, i.e., auxiliary captions defined in our paper, will significantly boost the performance. To this end, we propose an Auxiliary Caption Network (ACNet) for video grounding. Specifically, we first introduce dense video captioning to generate dense captions and then obtain auxiliary captions by Non-Auxiliary Caption Suppression (NACS). To capture the potential information in auxiliary captions, we propose Caption Guided Attention (CGA) project the semantic relations between auxiliary captions and query sentences into temporal space and fuse them into visual representations. Considering the gap between auxiliary captions and ground truth, we propose Asymmetric Cross-modal Contrastive Learning (ACCL) for constructing more negative pairs to maximize cross-modal mutual information. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., ActivityNet Captions, TACoS and ActivityNet-CG) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2301.06013,Rethinking Precision of Pseudo Label: Test-Time Adaptation via   Complementary Learning,"In this work, we propose a novel complementary learning approach to enhance test-time adaptation (TTA), which has been proven to exhibit good performance on testing data with distribution shifts such as corruptions. In test-time adaptation tasks, information from the source domain is typically unavailable and the model has to be optimized without supervision for test-time samples. Hence, usual methods assign labels for unannotated data with the prediction by a well-trained source model in an unsupervised learning framework. Previous studies have employed unsupervised objectives, such as the entropy of model predictions, as optimization targets to effectively learn features for test-time samples. However, the performance of the model is easily compromised by the quality of pseudo-labels, since inaccuracies in pseudo-labels introduce noise to the model. Therefore, we propose to leverage the ""less probable categories"" to decrease the risk of incorrect pseudo-labeling. The complementary label is introduced to designate these categories. We highlight that the risk function of complementary labels agrees with their Vanilla loss formula under the conventional true label distribution. Experiments show that the proposed learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets and experiment settings."
2301.06081,Learning to adapt unknown noise for hyperspectral image denoising,"For hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising task, the causes of noise embeded in an HSI are typically complex and uncontrollable. Thus, it remains a challenge for model-based HSI denoising methods to handle complex noise. To enhance the noise-handling capabilities of existing model-based methods, we resort to design a general weighted data fidelity term. The weight in this term is used to assess the noise intensity and thus elementwisely adjust the contribution of the observed noisy HSI in a denoising model. The similar concept of ""weighting"" has been hinted in several methods. Due to the unknown nature of the noise distribution, the implementation of ""weighting"" in these works are usually achieved via empirical formula for specific denoising method. In this work, we propose to predict the weight by a hyper-weight network (i.e., HWnet). The HWnet is learned exactly from several model-based HSI denoising methods in a bi-level optimization framework based on the data-driven methodology. For a noisy HSI, the learned HWnet outputs its corresponding weight. Then the weighted data fidelity term implemented with the predicted weight can be explicitly combined with a target model-based HSI denoising method. In this way, our HWnet achieves the goal of enhancing the noise adaptation ability of model-based HSI denoising methods for different noisy HSIs. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed HWnet can effecitvely help to improve the ability of an HSI denoising model to handle different complex noises. This further implies that our HWnet could transfer the noise knowledge at the model level and we also study the corresponding generalization theory for simple illustration."
2301.06084,Scattering-induced entropy boost for highly-compressed optical sensing   and encryption,"Image sensing often relies on a high-quality machine vision system with a large field of view and high resolution. It requires fine imaging optics, has high computational costs, and requires a large communication bandwidth between image sensors and computing units. In this paper, we propose a novel image-free sensing framework for resource-efficient image classification, where the required number of measurements can be reduced by up to two orders of magnitude. In the proposed framework for single-pixel detection, the optical field for a target is first scattered by an optical diffuser and then two-dimensionally modulated by a spatial light modulator. The optical diffuser simultaneously serves as a compressor and an encryptor for the target information, effectively narrowing the field of view and improving the system's security. The one-dimensional sequence of intensity values, which is measured with time-varying patterns on the spatial light modulator, is then used to extract semantic information based on end-to-end deep learning. The proposed sensing framework is shown to obtain over a 95\% accuracy at sampling rates of 1% and 5% for classification on the MNIST dataset and the recognition of Chinese license plates, respectively, and the framework is up to 24% more efficient than the approach without an optical diffuser. The proposed framework represents a significant breakthrough in high-throughput machine intelligence for scene analysis with low bandwidth, low costs, and strong encryption."
2301.06132,Deep Diversity-Enhanced Feature Representation of Hyperspectral Images,"In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently and effectively embedding the high-dimensional spatio-spectral information of hyperspectral (HS) images, guided by feature diversity. Specifically, based on the theoretical formulation that feature diversity is correlated with the rank of the unfolded kernel matrix, we rectify 3D convolution by modifying its topology to enhance the rank upper-bound. This modification yields a rank-enhanced spatial-spectral symmetrical convolution set (ReS$^3$-ConvSet), which not only learns diverse and powerful feature representations but also saves network parameters. Additionally, we also propose a novel diversity-aware regularization (DA-Reg) term that directly acts on the feature maps to maximize independence among elements. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ReS$^3$-ConvSet and DA-Reg, we apply them to various HS image processing and analysis tasks, including denoising, spatial super-resolution, and classification. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively to a significant extent. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jinnh/ReSSS-ConvSet."
2301.06230,Swarm-SLAM : Sparse Decentralized Collaborative Simultaneous   Localization and Mapping Framework for Multi-Robot Systems,"Collaborative Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (C-SLAM) is a vital component for successful multi-robot operations in environments without an external positioning system, such as indoors, underground or underwater. In this paper, we introduce Swarm-SLAM, an open-source C-SLAM system that is designed to be scalable, flexible, decentralized, and sparse, which are all key properties in swarm robotics. Our system supports inertial, lidar, stereo, and RGB-D sensing, and it includes a novel inter-robot loop closure prioritization technique that reduces communication and accelerates convergence. We evaluated our ROS-2 implementation on five different datasets, and in a real-world experiment with three robots communicating through an ad-hoc network. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/MISTLab/Swarm-SLAM"
2301.06267,Multimodality Helps Unimodality: Cross-Modal Few-Shot Learning with   Multimodal Models,"The ability to quickly learn a new task with minimal instruction - known as few-shot learning - is a central aspect of intelligent agents. Classical few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently. In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better ${\bf visual}$ dog classifier by ${\bf read}$ing about dogs and ${\bf listen}$ing to them bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models such as CLIP learn cross-modal encoders that map different modalities to the same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple strategy for ${\bf cross-modal}$ ${\bf adaptation}$: we treat examples from different modalities as additional few-shot examples. For example, by simply repurposing class names as an additional training sample, we trivially turn any n-shot learning problem into a (n+1)-shot problem. This allows us to produce SOTA results with embarrassingly simple linear classifiers. We show that our approach can be combined with existing methods such as prefix tuning, adapters, and classifier ensembling. Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification."
2301.06293,Representation Learning for Tablet and Paper Domain Adaptation in Favor   of Online Handwriting Recognition,"The performance of a machine learning model degrades when it is applied to data from a similar but different domain than the data it has initially been trained on. The goal of domain adaptation (DA) is to mitigate this domain shift problem by searching for an optimal feature transformation to learn a domain-invariant representation. Such a domain shift can appear in handwriting recognition (HWR) applications where the motion pattern of the hand and with that the motion pattern of the pen is different for writing on paper and on tablet. This becomes visible in the sensor data for online handwriting (OnHW) from pens with integrated inertial measurement units. This paper proposes a supervised DA approach to enhance learning for OnHW recognition between tablet and paper data. Our method exploits loss functions such as maximum mean discrepancy and correlation alignment to learn a domain-invariant feature representation (i.e., similar covariances between tablet and paper features). We use a triplet loss that takes negative samples of the auxiliary domain (i.e., paper samples) to increase the amount of samples of the tablet dataset. We conduct an evaluation on novel sequence-based OnHW datasets (i.e., words) and show an improvement on the paper domain with an early fusion strategy by using pairwise learning."
2301.06366,Evaluating clinical diversity and plausibility of synthetic capsule   endoscopic images,"Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is being increasingly used as an alternative imaging modality for complete and non-invasive screening of the gastrointestinal tract. Although this is advantageous in reducing unnecessary hospital admissions, it also demands that a WCE diagnostic protocol be in place so larger populations can be effectively screened. This calls for training and education protocols attuned specifically to this modality. Like training in other modalities such as traditional endoscopy, CT, MRI, etc., a WCE training protocol would require an atlas comprising of a large corpora of images that show vivid descriptions of pathologies and abnormalities, ideally observed over a period of time. Since such comprehensive atlases are presently lacking in WCE, in this work, we propose a deep learning method for utilizing already available studies across different institutions for the creation of a realistic WCE atlas using StyleGAN. We identify clinically relevant attributes in WCE such that synthetic images can be generated with selected attributes on cue. Beyond this, we also simulate several disease progression scenarios. The generated images are evaluated for realism and plausibility through three subjective online experiments with the participation of eight gastroenterology experts from three geographical locations and a variety of years of experience. The results from the experiments indicate that the images are highly realistic and the disease scenarios plausible. The images comprising the atlas are available publicly for use in training applications as well as supplementing real datasets for deep learning."
2301.06626,Masked Vector Quantization,"Generative models with discrete latent representations have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to learn complex high-dimensional data distributions. However, their performance relies on a long sequence of tokens per instance and a large number of codebook entries, resulting in long sampling times and considerable computation to fit the categorical posterior. To address these issues, we propose the Masked Vector Quantization (MVQ) framework which increases the representational capacity of each code vector by learning mask configurations via a stochastic winner-takes-all training regime called Multiple Hypothese Dropout (MH-Dropout). On ImageNet 64$\times$64, MVQ reduces FID in existing vector quantization architectures by up to $68\%$ at 2 tokens per instance and $57\%$ at 5 tokens. These improvements widen as codebook entries is reduced and allows for $7\textit{--}45\times$ speed-up in token sampling during inference. As an additional benefit, we find that smaller latent spaces lead to MVQ identifying transferable visual representations where multiple can be smoothly combined."
2301.06657,Free Lunch for Generating Effective Outlier Supervision,"When deployed in practical applications, computer vision systems will encounter numerous unexpected images (\emph{{i.e.}}, out-of-distribution data). Due to the potentially raised safety risks, these aforementioned unseen data should be carefully identified and handled. Generally, existing approaches in dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mainly focus on the statistical difference between the features of OOD and in-distribution (ID) data extracted by the classifiers. Although many of these schemes have brought considerable performance improvements, reducing the false positive rate (FPR) when processing open-set images, they necessarily lack reliable theoretical analysis and generalization guarantees. Unlike the observed ways, in this paper, we investigate the OOD detection problem based on the Bayes rule and present a convincing description of the reason for failures encountered by conventional classifiers. Concretely, our analysis reveals that refining the probability distribution yielded by the vanilla neural networks is necessary for OOD detection, alleviating the issues of assigning high confidence to OOD data. To achieve this effortlessly, we propose an ultra-effective method to generate near-realistic outlier supervision. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks reveal that our proposed \texttt{BayesAug} significantly reduces the FPR95 over 12.50\% compared with the previous schemes, boosting the reliability of machine learning systems. The code will be made publicly available."
2301.06683,From Isolation to Collaboration: Federated Class-Heterogeneous Learning   for Chest X-Ray Classification,"Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to collaboratively train a global chest x-ray (CXR) classification model using distributed datasets while preserving patient privacy. A significant, yet relatively underexplored, challenge in FL is class-heterogeneity, where clients have different sets of classes. We propose surgical aggregation, a FL method that uses selective aggregation to collaboratively train a global model using distributed, class-heterogeneous datasets. Unlike other methods, our method does not rely on the assumption that clients share the same classes as other clients, know the classes of other clients, or have access to a fully annotated dataset. We evaluate surgical aggregation using class-heterogeneous CXR datasets across IID and non-IID settings. Our results show that our method outperforms current methods and has better generalizability."
2301.06943,Self-supervised Domain Adaptation for Breaking the Limits of Low-quality   Fundus Image Quality Enhancement,"Retinal fundus images have been applied for the diagnosis and screening of eye diseases, such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). However, both low-quality fundus images and style inconsistency potentially increase uncertainty in the diagnosis of fundus disease and even lead to misdiagnosis by ophthalmologists. Most of the existing image enhancement methods mainly focus on improving the image quality by leveraging the guidance of high-quality images, which is difficult to be collected in medical applications. In this paper, we tackle image quality enhancement in a fully unsupervised setting, i.e., neither paired images nor high-quality images. To this end, we explore the potential of the self-supervised task for improving the quality of fundus images without the requirement of high-quality reference images. Specifically, we construct multiple patch-wise domains via an auxiliary pre-trained quality assessment network and a style clustering. To achieve robust low-quality image enhancement and address style inconsistency, we formulate two self-supervised domain adaptation tasks to disentangle the features of image content, low-quality factor and style information by exploring intrinsic supervision signals within the low-quality images. Extensive experiments are conducted on EyeQ and Messidor datasets, and results show that our DASQE method achieves new state-of-the-art performance when only low-quality images are available."
2301.07002,Opti-CAM: Optimizing saliency maps for interpretability,"Methods based on class activation maps (CAM) provide a simple mechanism to interpret predictions of convolutional neural networks by using linear combinations of feature maps as saliency maps. By contrast, masking-based methods optimize a saliency map directly in the image space or learn it by training another network on additional data.   In this work we introduce Opti-CAM, combining ideas from CAM-based and masking-based approaches. Our saliency map is a linear combination of feature maps, where weights are optimized per image such that the logit of the masked image for a given class is maximized. We also fix a fundamental flaw in two of the most common evaluation metrics of attribution methods. On several datasets, Opti-CAM largely outperforms other CAM-based approaches according to the most relevant classification metrics. We provide empirical evidence supporting that localization and classifier interpretability are not necessarily aligned."
2301.07088,Vision Learners Meet Web Image-Text Pairs,"Many self-supervised learning methods are pre-trained on the well-curated ImageNet-1K dataset. In this work, given the excellent scalability of web data, we consider self-supervised pre-training on noisy web sourced image-text paired data. First, we conduct a benchmark study of representative self-supervised pre-training methods on large-scale web data in a like-for-like setting. We compare a range of methods, including single-modal ones that use masked training objectives and multi-modal ones that use image-text constrastive training. We observe that existing multi-modal methods do not outperform their single-modal counterparts on vision transfer learning tasks. We derive an information-theoretical view to explain these benchmark results, which provides insight into how to design a novel vision learner. Inspired by this insight, we present a new visual representation pre-training method, MUlti-modal Generator~(MUG), that learns from scalable web sourced image-text data. MUG achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on a variety of tasks and demonstrates promising scaling properties. Pre-trained models and code will be made public upon acceptance."
2301.07150,Embodied Agents for Efficient Exploration and Smart Scene Description,"The development of embodied agents that can communicate with humans in natural language has gained increasing interest over the last years, as it facilitates the diffusion of robotic platforms in human-populated environments. As a step towards this objective, in this work, we tackle a setting for visual navigation in which an autonomous agent needs to explore and map an unseen indoor environment while portraying interesting scenes with natural language descriptions. To this end, we propose and evaluate an approach that combines recent advances in visual robotic exploration and image captioning on images generated through agent-environment interaction. Our approach can generate smart scene descriptions that maximize semantic knowledge of the environment and avoid repetitions. Further, such descriptions offer user-understandable insights into the robot's representation of the environment by highlighting the prominent objects and the correlation between them as encountered during the exploration. To quantitatively assess the performance of the proposed approach, we also devise a specific score that takes into account both exploration and description skills. The experiments carried out on both photorealistic simulated environments and real-world ones demonstrate that our approach can effectively describe the robot's point of view during exploration, improving the human-friendly interpretability of its observations."
2301.07330,FPANet: Frequency-based Video Demoireing using Frame-level Post   Alignment,"Moire patterns, created by the interference between overlapping grid patterns in the pixel space, degrade the visual quality of images and videos. Therefore, removing such patterns~(demoireing) is crucial, yet remains a challenge due to their complexities in sizes and distortions. Conventional methods mainly tackle this task by only exploiting the spatial domain of the input images, limiting their capabilities in removing large-scale moire patterns. Therefore, this work proposes FPANet, an image-video demoireing network that learns filters in both frequency and spatial domains, improving the restoration quality by removing various sizes of moire patterns. To further enhance, our model takes multiple consecutive frames, learning to extract frame-invariant content features and outputting better quality temporally consistent images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with a publicly available large-scale dataset, observing that ours outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of image and video quality metrics and visual experience."
2301.07407,TAME: Attention Mechanism Based Feature Fusion for Generating   Explanation Maps of Convolutional Neural Networks,"The apparent ``black box'' nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. This paper presents TAME (Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations), a method for generating explanation maps with a multi-branch hierarchical attention mechanism. TAME combines a target model's feature maps from multiple layers using an attention mechanism, transforming them into an explanation map. TAME can easily be applied to any convolutional neural network (CNN) by streamlining the optimization of the attention mechanism's training method and the selection of target model's feature maps. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass. We apply TAME to two widely used models, i.e. VGG-16 and ResNet-50, trained on ImageNet and show improvements over previous top-performing methods. We also provide a comprehensive ablation study comparing the performance of different variations of TAME's architecture. TAME source code is made publicly available at https://github.com/bmezaris/TAME"
2301.07409,Representing Noisy Image Without Denoising,"A long-standing topic in artificial intelligence is the effective recognition of patterns from noisy images. In this regard, the recent data-driven paradigm considers 1) improving the representation robustness by adding noisy samples in training phase (i.e., data augmentation) or 2) pre-processing the noisy image by learning to solve the inverse problem (i.e., image denoising). However, such methods generally exhibit inefficient process and unstable result, limiting their practical applications. In this paper, we explore a non-learning paradigm that aims to derive robust representation directly from noisy images, without the denoising as pre-processing. Here, the noise-robust representation is designed as Fractional-order Moments in Radon space (FMR), with also beneficial properties of orthogonality and rotation invariance. Unlike earlier integer-order methods, our work is a more generic design taking such classical methods as special cases, and the introduced fractional-order parameter offers time-frequency analysis capability that is not available in classical methods. Formally, both implicit and explicit paths for constructing the FMR are discussed in detail. Extensive simulation experiments and an image security application are provided to demonstrate the uniqueness and usefulness of our FMR, especially for noise robustness, rotation invariance, and time-frequency discriminability."
2301.07519,Site-specific weed management in corn using UAS imagery analysis and   computer vision techniques,"Currently, weed control in commercial corn production is performed without considering weed distribution information in the field. This kind of weed management practice leads to excessive amounts of chemical herbicides being applied in a given field. The objective of this study was to perform site-specific weed control (SSWC) in a corn field by 1) using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to map the spatial distribution information of weeds in the field; 2) creating a prescription map based on the weed distribution map, and 3) spraying the field using the prescription map and a commercial size sprayer. In this study, we are proposing a Crop Row Identification (CRI) algorithm, a computer vision algorithm that identifies corn rows on UAS imagery. After being identified, the corn rows were then removed from the imagery and the remaining vegetation fraction was classified as weeds. Based on that information, a grid-based weed prescription map was created and the weed control application was implemented through a commercial-size sprayer. The decision of spraying herbicides on a particular grid was based on the presence of weeds in that grid cell. All the grids that contained at least one weed were sprayed, while the grids free of weeds were not. Using our SSWC approach, we were able to save 26.23\% of the land (1.97 acres) from being sprayed with chemical herbicides compared to the existing method. This study presents a full workflow from UAS image collection to field weed control implementation using a commercial-size sprayer, and it shows that some level of savings can potentially be obtained even in a situation with high weed infestation, which might provide an opportunity to reduce chemical usage in corn production systems."
2301.07666,DDS: Decoupled Dynamic Scene-Graph Generation Network,"Scene-graph generation involves creating a structural representation of the relationships between objects in a scene by predicting subject-object-relation triplets from input data. Existing methods show poor performance in detecting triplets outside of a predefined set, primarily due to their reliance on dependent feature learning. To address this issue, we propose DDS -- a decoupled dynamic scene-graph generation network -- that consists of two independent branches that can disentangle extracted features. The key innovation of the current paper is the decoupling of the features representing the relationships from those of the objects, which enables the detection of novel object-relationship combinations. The DDS model is evaluated on three datasets and outperforms previous methods by a significant margin, especially in detecting previously unseen triplets."
2301.07868,MV-Adapter: Multimodal Video Transfer Learning for Video Text Retrieval,"State-of-the-art video-text retrieval (VTR) methods typically involve fully fine-tuning a pre-trained model (e.g. CLIP) on specific datasets. However, this can result in significant storage costs in practical applications as a separate model per task must be stored. To address this issue, we present our pioneering work that enables parameter-efficient VTR using a pre-trained model, with only a small number of tunable parameters during training. Towards this goal, we propose a new method dubbed Multimodal Video Adapter (MV-Adapter) for efficiently transferring the knowledge in the pre-trained CLIP from image-text to video-text. Specifically, MV-Adapter utilizes bottleneck structures in both video and text branches, along with two novel components. The first is a Temporal Adaptation Module that is incorporated in the video branch to introduce global and local temporal contexts. We also train weights calibrations to adjust to dynamic variations across frames. The second is Cross Modality Tying that generates weights for video/text branches through sharing cross modality factors, for better aligning between modalities. Thanks to above innovations, MV-Adapter can achieve comparable or better performance than standard full fine-tuning with negligible parameters overhead. Notably, MV-Adapter consistently outperforms various competing methods in V2T/T2V tasks with large margins on five widely used VTR benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet)."
2301.07969,Fast Inference in Denoising Diffusion Models via MMD Finetuning,"Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have become a popular tool for generating high-quality samples from complex data distributions. These models are able to capture sophisticated patterns and structures in the data, and can generate samples that are highly diverse and representative of the underlying distribution. However, one of the main limitations of diffusion models is the complexity of sample generation, since a large number of inference timesteps is required to faithfully capture the data distribution. In this paper, we present MMD-DDM, a novel method for fast sampling of diffusion models. Our approach is based on the idea of using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to finetune the learned distribution with a given budget of timesteps. This allows the finetuned model to significantly improve the speed-quality trade-off, by substantially increasing fidelity in inference regimes with few steps or, equivalently, by reducing the required number of steps to reach a target fidelity, thus paving the way for a more practical adoption of diffusion models in a wide range of applications. We evaluate our approach on unconditional image generation with extensive experiments across the CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet and LSUN-Church datasets. Our findings show that the proposed method is able to produce high-quality samples in a fraction of the time required by widely-used diffusion models, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for accelerated sampling. Code is available at: https://github.com/diegovalsesia/MMD-DDM."
2301.08072,Dif-Fusion: Towards High Color Fidelity in Infrared and Visible Image   Fusion with Diffusion Models,"Color plays an important role in human visual perception, reflecting the spectrum of objects. However, the existing infrared and visible image fusion methods rarely explore how to handle multi-spectral/channel data directly and achieve high color fidelity. This paper addresses the above issue by proposing a novel method with diffusion models, termed as Dif-Fusion, to generate the distribution of the multi-channel input data, which increases the ability of multi-source information aggregation and the fidelity of colors. In specific, instead of converting multi-channel images into single-channel data in existing fusion methods, we create the multi-channel data distribution with a denoising network in a latent space with forward and reverse diffusion process. Then, we use the the denoising network to extract the multi-channel diffusion features with both visible and infrared information. Finally, we feed the multi-channel diffusion features to the multi-channel fusion module to directly generate the three-channel fused image. To retain the texture and intensity information, we propose multi-channel gradient loss and intensity loss. Along with the current evaluation metrics for measuring texture and intensity fidelity, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify color fidelity. Extensive experiments indicate that our method is more effective than other state-of-the-art image fusion methods, especially in color fidelity."
2301.08092,RNAS-CL: Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge   Distillation,"Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), one of the driving tools of deep neural networks, demonstrates superior performance in prediction accuracy in various machine learning applications. However, it is unclear how it performs against adversarial attacks. Given the presence of a robust teacher, it would be interesting to investigate if NAS would produce robust neural architecture by inheriting robustness from the teacher. In this paper, we propose Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge Distillation (RNAS-CL), a novel NAS algorithm that improves the robustness of NAS by learning from a robust teacher through cross-layer knowledge distillation. Unlike previous knowledge distillation methods that encourage close student/teacher output only in the last layer, RNAS-CL automatically searches for the best teacher layer to supervise each student layer. Experimental result evidences the effectiveness of RNAS-CL and shows that RNAS-CL produces small and robust neural architecture."
2301.08237,LoCoNet: Long-Short Context Network for Active Speaker Detection,"Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is speaking in each frame of a video. ASD reasons from audio and visual information from two contexts: long-term intra-speaker context and short-term inter-speaker context. Long-term intra-speaker context models the temporal dependencies of the same speaker, while short-term inter-speaker context models the interactions of speakers in the same scene. These two contexts are complementary to each other and can help infer the active speaker. Motivated by these observations, we propose LoCoNet, a simple yet effective Long-Short Context Network that models the long-term intra-speaker context and short-term inter-speaker context. We use self-attention to model long-term intra-speaker context due to its effectiveness in modeling long-range dependencies, and convolutional blocks that capture local patterns to model short-term inter-speaker context. Extensive experiments show that LoCoNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, achieving an mAP of 95.2%(+1.1%) on AVA-ActiveSpeaker, 68.1%(+22%) on Columbia dataset, 97.2%(+2.8%) on Talkies dataset and 59.7%(+8.0%) on Ego4D dataset. Moreover, in challenging cases where multiple speakers are present, or face of active speaker is much smaller than other faces in the same scene, LoCoNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.4% on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/SJTUwxz/LoCoNet_ASD."
2301.08245,Booster: a Benchmark for Depth from Images of Specular and Transparent   Surfaces,"Estimating depth from images nowadays yields outstanding results, both in terms of in-domain accuracy and generalization. However, we identify two main challenges that remain open in this field: dealing with non-Lambertian materials and effectively processing high-resolution images. Purposely, we propose a novel dataset that includes accurate and dense ground-truth labels at high resolution, featuring scenes containing several specular and transparent surfaces. Our acquisition pipeline leverages a novel deep space-time stereo framework, enabling easy and accurate labeling with sub-pixel precision. The dataset is composed of 606 samples collected in 85 different scenes, each sample includes both a high-resolution pair (12 Mpx) as well as an unbalanced stereo pair (Left: 12 Mpx, Right: 1.1 Mpx), typical of modern mobile devices that mount sensors with different resolutions. Additionally, we provide manually annotated material segmentation masks and 15K unlabeled samples. The dataset is composed of a train set and two test sets, the latter devoted to the evaluation of stereo and monocular depth estimation networks. Our experiments highlight the open challenges and future research directions in this field."
2301.08455,Spatial Steerability of GANs via Self-Supervision from Discriminator,"Generative models make huge progress to the photorealistic image synthesis in recent years. To enable human to steer the image generation process and customize the output, many works explore the interpretable dimensions of the latent space in GANs. Existing methods edit the attributes of the output image such as orientation or color scheme by varying the latent code along certain directions. However, these methods usually require additional human annotations for each pretrained model, and they mostly focus on editing global attributes. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to improve the spatial steerability of GANs without searching for steerable directions in the latent space or requiring extra annotations. Specifically, we design randomly sampled Gaussian heatmaps to be encoded into the intermediate layers of generative models as spatial inductive bias. Along with training the GAN model from scratch, these heatmaps are being aligned with the emerging attention of the GAN's discriminator in a self-supervised learning manner. During inference, users can interact with the spatial heatmaps in an intuitive manner, enabling them to edit the output image by adjusting the scene layout, moving, or removing objects. Moreover, we incorporate DragGAN into our framework, which facilitates fine-grained manipulation within a reasonable time and supports a coarse-to-fine editing process. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only enables spatial editing over human faces, animal faces, outdoor scenes, and complicated multi-object indoor scenes but also brings improvement in synthesis quality. Code, models, and demo video are available at https://genforce.github.io/SpatialGAN/."
2301.08555,Hybrid Open-set Segmentation with Synthetic Negative Data,"Open-set segmentation can be conceived by complementing closed-set classification with anomaly detection. Many of the existing dense anomaly detectors operate through generative modelling of regular data or by discriminating with respect to negative data. These two approaches optimize different objectives and therefore exhibit different failure modes. Consequently, we propose a novel anomaly score that fuses generative and discriminative cues. Our score can be implemented by upgrading any closed-set segmentation model with dense estimates of dataset posterior and unnormalized data likelihood. The resulting dense hybrid open-set models require negative training images that can be sampled from an auxiliary negative dataset, from a jointly trained generative model, or from a mixture of both sources. We evaluate our contributions on benchmarks for dense anomaly detection and open-set segmentation. The experiments reveal strong open-set performance in spite of negligible computational overhead."
2301.08605,A Deep Learning Approach for SAR Tomographic Imaging of Forested Areas,"Synthetic aperture radar tomographic imaging reconstructs the three-dimensional reflectivity of a scene from a set of coherent acquisitions performed in an interferometric configuration. In forest areas, a large number of elements backscatter the radar signal within each resolution cell. To reconstruct the vertical reflectivity profile, state-of-the-art techniques perform a regularized inversion implemented in the form of iterative minimization algorithms. We show that light-weight neural networks can be trained to perform the tomographic inversion with a single feed-forward pass, leading to fast reconstructions that could better scale to the amount of data provided by the future BIOMASS mission. We train our encoder-decoder network using simulated data and validate our technique on real L-band and P-band data."
2301.08898,Recurrent Generic Contour-based Instance Segmentation with Progressive   Learning,"Contour-based instance segmentation has been actively studied, thanks to its flexibility and elegance in processing visual objects within complex backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep network architecture, i.e., PolySnake, for generic contour-based instance segmentation. Motivated by the classic Snake algorithm, the proposed PolySnake achieves superior and robust segmentation performance with an iterative and progressive contour refinement strategy. Technically, PolySnake introduces a recurrent update operator to estimate the object contour iteratively. It maintains a single estimate of the contour that is progressively deformed toward the object boundary. At each iteration, PolySnake builds a semantic-rich representation for the current contour and feeds it to the recurrent operator for further contour adjustment. Through the iterative refinements, the contour progressively converges to a stable status that tightly encloses the object instance. Beyond the scope of general instance segmentation, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our PolySnake in two additional specific task scenarios, including scene text detection and lane detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed PolySnake outperforms the existing advanced methods on several multiple prevalent benchmarks across the three tasks. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/fh2019ustc/PolySnake"
2301.08965,Raw or Cooked? Object Detection on RAW Images,"Images fed to a deep neural network have in general undergone several handcrafted image signal processing (ISP) operations, all of which have been optimized to produce visually pleasing images. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that the intermediate representation of visually pleasing images is sub-optimal for downstream computer vision tasks compared to the RAW image representation. We suggest that the operations of the ISP instead should be optimized towards the end task, by learning the parameters of the operations jointly during training. We extend previous works on this topic and propose a new learnable operation that enables an object detector to achieve superior performance when compared to both previous works and traditional RGB images. In experiments on the open PASCALRAW dataset, we empirically confirm our hypothesis."
2301.09209,Summarize the Past to Predict the Future: Natural Language Descriptions   of Context Boost Multimodal Object Interaction Anticipation,"We study object interaction anticipation in egocentric videos. This task requires an understanding of the spatio-temporal context formed by past actions on objects, coined action context. We propose TransFusion, a multimodal transformer-based architecture. It exploits the representational power of language by summarizing the action context. TransFusion leverages pre-trained image captioning and vision-language models to extract the action context from past video frames. This action context together with the next video frame is processed by the multimodal fusion module to forecast the next object interaction. Our model enables more efficient end-to-end learning. The large pre-trained language models add common sense and a generalisation capability. Experiments on Ego4D and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 show the effectiveness of our multimodal fusion model. They also highlight the benefits of using language-based context summaries in a task where vision seems to suffice. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 40.4% in relative terms in overall mAP on the Ego4D test set. We validate the effectiveness of TransFusion via experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100. Video and code are available at https://eth-ait.github.io/transfusion-proj/."
2301.09422,HALOC: Hardware-Aware Automatic Low-Rank Compression for Compact Neural   Networks,"Low-rank compression is an important model compression strategy for obtaining compact neural network models. In general, because the rank values directly determine the model complexity and model accuracy, proper selection of layer-wise rank is very critical and desired. To date, though many low-rank compression approaches, either selecting the ranks in a manual or automatic way, have been proposed, they suffer from costly manual trials or unsatisfied compression performance. In addition, all of the existing works are not designed in a hardware-aware way, limiting the practical performance of the compressed models on real-world hardware platforms.   To address these challenges, in this paper we propose HALOC, a hardware-aware automatic low-rank compression framework. By interpreting automatic rank selection from an architecture search perspective, we develop an end-to-end solution to determine the suitable layer-wise ranks in a differentiable and hardware-aware way. We further propose design principles and mitigation strategy to efficiently explore the rank space and reduce the potential interference problem.   Experimental results on different datasets and hardware platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. On CIFAR-10 dataset, HALOC enables 0.07% and 0.38% accuracy increase over the uncompressed ResNet-20 and VGG-16 models with 72.20% and 86.44% fewer FLOPs, respectively. On ImageNet dataset, HALOC achieves 0.9% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-18 model with 66.16% fewer FLOPs. HALOC also shows 0.66% higher top-1 accuracy increase than the state-of-the-art automatic low-rank compression solution with fewer computational and memory costs. In addition, HALOC demonstrates the practical speedups on different hardware platforms, verified by the measurement results on desktop GPU, embedded GPU and ASIC accelerator."
2301.09430,Rethinking Real-world Image Deraining via An Unpaired   Degradation-Conditioned Diffusion Model,"Recent diffusion models have exhibited great potential in generative modeling tasks. Part of their success can be attributed to the ability of training stable on huge sets of paired synthetic data. However, adapting these models to real-world image deraining remains difficult for two aspects. First, collecting a large-scale paired real-world clean/rainy dataset is unavailable while regular conditional diffusion models heavily rely on paired data for training. Second, real-world rain usually reflects real-world scenarios with a variety of unknown rain degradation types, which poses a significant challenge for the generative modeling process. To meet these challenges, we propose RainDiff, the first real-world image deraining paradigm based on diffusion models, serving as a new standard bar for real-world image deraining. We address the first challenge by introducing a stable and non-adversarial unpaired cycle-consistent architecture that can be trained, end-to-end, with only unpaired data for supervision; and the second challenge by proposing a degradation-conditioned diffusion model that refines the desired output via a diffusive generative process conditioned by learned priors of multiple rain degradations. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our RainDiff over existing unpaired/semi-supervised methods and show its competitive advantages over several fully-supervised ones."
2301.09431,Multi-domain stain normalization for digital pathology: A   cycle-consistent adversarial network for whole slide images,"The variation in histologic staining between different medical centers is one of the most profound challenges in the field of computer-aided diagnosis. The appearance disparity of pathological whole slide images causes algorithms to become less reliable, which in turn impedes the wide-spread applicability of downstream tasks like cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, different stainings lead to biases in the training which in case of domain shifts negatively affect the test performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose MultiStain-CycleGAN, a multi-domain approach to stain normalization based on CycleGAN. Our modifications to CycleGAN allow us to normalize images of different origins without retraining or using different models. We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using various metrics and compare it to commonly used methods that are multi-domain capable. First, we evaluate how well our method fools a domain classifier that tries to assign a medical center to an image. Then, we test our normalization on the tumor classification performance of a downstream classifier. Furthermore, we evaluate the image quality of the normalized images using the Structural similarity index and the ability to reduce the domain shift using the Fr\'echet inception distance. We show that our method proves to be multi-domain capable, provides the highest image quality among the compared methods, and can most reliably fool the domain classifier while keeping the tumor classifier performance high. By reducing the domain influence, biases in the data can be removed on the one hand and the origin of the whole slide image can be disguised on the other, thus enhancing patient data privacy."
2301.09489,Contracting Skeletal Kinematics for Human-Related Video Anomaly   Detection,"Detecting the anomaly of human behavior is paramount to timely recognizing endangering situations, such as street fights or elderly falls. However, anomaly detection is complex since anomalous events are rare and because it is an open set recognition task, i.e., what is anomalous at inference has not been observed at training. We propose COSKAD, a novel model that encodes skeletal human motion by a graph convolutional network and learns to COntract SKeletal kinematic embeddings onto a latent hypersphere of minimum volume for Video Anomaly Detection. We propose three latent spaces: the commonly-adopted Euclidean and the novel spherical and hyperbolic. All variants outperform the state-of-the-art on the most recent UBnormal dataset, for which we contribute a human-related version with annotated skeletons. COSKAD sets a new state-of-the-art on the human-related versions of ShanghaiTech Campus and CUHK Avenue, with performance comparable to video-based methods. Source code and dataset will be released upon acceptance."
2301.09522,Optimising Event-Driven Spiking Neural Network with Regularisation and   Cutoff,"Spiking neural network (SNN), as the next generation of artificial neural network (ANN), offer a closer mimicry of natural neural networks and hold promise for significant improvements in computational efficiency. However, the current SNN is trained to infer over a fixed duration, overlooking the potential of dynamic inference in SNN. In this paper, we strengthen the marriage between SNN and event-driven processing with a proposal to consider a cutoff in SNN, which can terminate SNN anytime during inference to achieve efficient inference. Two novel optimisation techniques are presented to achieve inference efficient SNN: a Top-K cutoff and a regularisation.The proposed regularisation influences the training process, optimising SNN for the cutoff, while the Top-K cutoff technique optimises the inference phase. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on multiple benchmark frame-based datasets, such asCIFAR10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and event-based datasets, including CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech101 and DVS128 Gesture. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in both ANN-to-SNN conversion and direct training, enabling SNNs to require 1.76 to 2.76x fewer timesteps for CIFAR-10, while achieving 1.64 to 1.95x fewer timesteps across all event-based datasets, with near-zero accuracy loss. These findings affirms the compatibility and potential benefits of our techniques in enhancing accuracy and reducing inference latency when integrated with existing methods.

2301.09620,Tracking the industrial growth of modern China with high-resolution   panchromatic imagery: A sequential convolutional approach,"Due to insufficient or difficult to obtain data on development in inaccessible regions, remote sensing data is an important tool for interested stakeholders to collect information on economic growth. To date, no studies have utilized deep learning to estimate industrial growth at the level of individual sites. In this study, we harness high-resolution panchromatic imagery to estimate development over time at 419 industrial sites in the People's Republic of China using a multi-tier computer vision framework. We present two methods for approximating development: (1) structural area coverage estimated through a Mask R-CNN segmentation algorithm, and (2) imputing development directly with visible & infrared radiance from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Labels generated from these methods are comparatively evaluated and tested. On a dataset of 2,078 50 cm resolution images spanning 19 years, the results indicate that two dimensions of industrial development can be estimated using high-resolution daytime imagery, including (a) the total square meters of industrial development (average error of 0.021 $\textrm{km}^2$), and (b) the radiance of lights (average error of 9.8 $\mathrm{\frac{nW}{cm^{2}sr}}$). Trend analysis of the techniques reveal estimates from a Mask R-CNN-labeled CNN-LSTM track ground truth measurements most closely. The Mask R-CNN estimates positive growth at every site from the oldest image to the most recent, with an average change of 4,084 $\textrm{m}^2$."
2301.10048,Exploiting Optical Flow Guidance for Transformer-Based Video Inpainting,"Transformers have been widely used for video processing owing to the multi-head self attention (MHSA) mechanism. However, the MHSA mechanism encounters an intrinsic difficulty for video inpainting, since the features associated with the corrupted regions are degraded and incur inaccurate self attention. This problem, termed query degradation, may be mitigated by first completing optical flows and then using the flows to guide the self attention, which was verified in our previous work - flow-guided transformer (FGT). We further exploit the flow guidance and propose FGT++ to pursue more effective and efficient video inpainting. First, we design a lightweight flow completion network by using local aggregation and edge loss. Second, to address the query degradation, we propose a flow guidance feature integration module, which uses the motion discrepancy to enhance the features, together with a flow-guided feature propagation module that warps the features according to the flows. Third, we decouple the transformer along the temporal and spatial dimensions, where flows are used to select the tokens through a temporally deformable MHSA mechanism, and global tokens are combined with the inner-window local tokens through a dual perspective MHSA mechanism. FGT++ is experimentally evaluated to be outperforming the existing video inpainting networks qualitatively and quantitatively."
2301.10327,Generating Multidimensional Clusters With Support Lines,"Synthetic data is essential for assessing clustering techniques, complementing and extending real data, and allowing for more complete coverage of a given problem's space. In turn, synthetic data generators have the potential of creating vast amounts of data -- a crucial activity when real-world data is at premium -- while providing a well-understood generation procedure and an interpretable instrument for methodically investigating cluster analysis algorithms. Here, we present Clugen, a modular procedure for synthetic data generation, capable of creating multidimensional clusters supported by line segments using arbitrary distributions. Clugen is open source, comprehensively unit tested and documented, and is available for the Python, R, Julia, and MATLAB/Octave ecosystems. We demonstrate that our proposal can produce rich and varied results in various dimensions, is fit for use in the assessment of clustering algorithms, and has the potential to be a widely used framework in diverse clustering-related research tasks."
2301.10460,HAL3D: Hierarchical Active Learning for Fine-Grained 3D Part Labeling,"We present the first active learning tool for fine-grained 3D part labeling, a problem which challenges even the most advanced deep learning (DL) methods due to the significant structural variations among the small and intricate parts. For the same reason, the necessary data annotation effort is tremendous, motivating approaches to minimize human involvement. Our labeling tool iteratively verifies or modifies part labels predicted by a deep neural network, with human feedback continually improving the network prediction. To effectively reduce human efforts, we develop two novel features in our tool, hierarchical and symmetry-aware active labeling. Our human-in-the-loop approach, coined HAL3D, achieves 100% accuracy (barring human errors) on any test set with pre-defined hierarchical part labels, with 80% time-saving over manual effort."
2301.10551,Variation-Aware Semantic Image Synthesis,"Semantic image synthesis (SIS) aims to produce photorealistic images aligning to given conditional semantic layout and has witnessed a significant improvement in recent years. Although the diversity in image-level has been discussed heavily, class-level mode collapse widely exists in current algorithms. Therefore, we declare a new requirement for SIS to achieve more photorealistic images, variation-aware, which consists of inter- and intra-class variation. The inter-class variation is the diversity between different semantic classes while the intra-class variation stresses the diversity inside one class. Through analysis, we find that current algorithms elusively embrace the inter-class variation but the intra-class variation is still not enough. Further, we introduce two simple methods to achieve variation-aware semantic image synthesis (VASIS) with a higher intra-class variation, semantic noise and position code. We combine our method with several state-of-the-art algorithms and the experimental result shows that our models generate more natural images and achieves slightly better FIDs and/or mIoUs than the counterparts. Our codes and models will be publicly available."
2301.10766,On the Adversarial Robustness of Camera-based 3D Object Detection,"In recent years, camera-based 3D object detection has gained widespread attention for its ability to achieve high performance with low computational cost. However, the robustness of these methods to adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly examined, especially when considering their deployment in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the robustness of leading camera-based 3D object detection approaches under various adversarial conditions. We systematically analyze the resilience of these models under two attack settings: white-box and black-box; focusing on two primary objectives: classification and localization. Additionally, we delve into two types of adversarial attack techniques: pixel-based and patch-based. Our experiments yield four interesting findings: (a) bird's-eye-view-based representations exhibit stronger robustness against localization attacks; (b) depth-estimation-free approaches have the potential to show stronger robustness; (c) accurate depth estimation effectively improves robustness for depth-estimation-based methods; (d) incorporating multi-frame benign inputs can effectively mitigate adversarial attacks. We hope our findings can steer the development of future camera-based object detection models with enhanced adversarial robustness."
2301.10829,TranSOP: Transformer-based Multimodal Classification for Stroke   Treatment Outcome Prediction,"Acute ischaemic stroke, caused by an interruption in blood flow to brain tissue, is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. The selection of patients for the most optimal ischaemic stroke treatment is a crucial step for a successful outcome, as the effect of treatment highly depends on the time to treatment. We propose a transformer-based multimodal network (TranSOP) for a classification approach that employs clinical metadata and imaging information, acquired on hospital admission, to predict the functional outcome of stroke treatment based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). This includes a fusion module to efficiently combine 3D non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) features and clinical information. In comparative experiments using unimodal and multimodal data on the MRCLEAN dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art AUC score of 0.85."
2301.10931,Towards Continual Egocentric Activity Recognition: A Multi-modal   Egocentric Activity Dataset for Continual Learning,"With the rapid development of wearable cameras, a massive collection of egocentric video for first-person visual perception becomes available. Using egocentric videos to predict first-person activity faces many challenges, including limited field of view, occlusions, and unstable motions. Observing that sensor data from wearable devices facilitates human activity recognition, multi-modal activity recognition is attracting increasing attention. However, the deficiency of related dataset hinders the development of multi-modal deep learning for egocentric activity recognition. Nowadays, deep learning in real world has led to a focus on continual learning that often suffers from catastrophic forgetting. But the catastrophic forgetting problem for egocentric activity recognition, especially in the context of multiple modalities, remains unexplored due to unavailability of dataset. In order to assist this research, we present a multi-modal egocentric activity dataset for continual learning named UESTC-MMEA-CL, which is collected by self-developed glasses integrating a first-person camera and wearable sensors. It contains synchronized data of videos, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, for 32 types of daily activities, performed by 10 participants. Its class types and scale are compared with other publicly available datasets. The statistical analysis of the sensor data is given to show the auxiliary effects for different behaviors. And results of egocentric activity recognition are reported when using separately, and jointly, three modalities: RGB, acceleration, and gyroscope, on a base network architecture. To explore the catastrophic forgetting in continual learning tasks, four baseline methods are extensively evaluated with different multi-modal combinations. We hope the UESTC-MMEA-CL can promote future studies on continual learning for first-person activity recognition in wearable applications."
2301.11104,Discovering and Mitigating Visual Biases through Keyword Explanation,"Addressing biases in computer vision models is crucial for real-world AI deployments. However, mitigating visual biases is challenging due to their unexplainable nature, often identified indirectly through visualization or sample statistics, which necessitates additional human supervision for interpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T) framework, which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically, we extract common keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential biases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their similarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model. The keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages, such as a clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing using these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify known biases, such as gender bias in CelebA, background bias in Waterbirds, and distribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally, B2T uncovers novel biases in larger datasets, such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example, we discovered a contextual bias between ""bee"" and ""flower"" in ImageNet. We also highlight various applications of B2T keywords, including debiased training, CLIP prompting, and model comparison."
2301.11145,Learning from Mistakes: Self-Regularizing Hierarchical Representations   in Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in autonomous robotic technologies have highlighted the growing need for precise environmental analysis. LiDAR semantic segmentation has gained attention to accomplish fine-grained scene understanding by acting directly on raw content provided by sensors. Recent solutions showed how different learning techniques can be used to improve the performance of the model, without any architectural or dataset change. Following this trend, we present a coarse-to-fine setup that LEArns from classification mistaKes (LEAK) derived from a standard model. First, classes are clustered into macro groups according to mutual prediction errors; then, the learning process is regularized by: (1) aligning class-conditional prototypical feature representation for both fine and coarse classes, (2) weighting instances with a per-class fairness index. Our LEAK approach is very general and can be seamlessly applied on top of any segmentation architecture; indeed, experimental results showed that it enables state-of-the-art performances on different architectures, datasets and tasks, while ensuring more balanced class-wise results and faster convergence."
2301.11201,Relative-Interior Solution for the (Incomplete) Linear Assignment Problem with Applications to the Quadratic Assignment Problem,"We study the set of optimal solutions of the dual linear programming formulation of the linear assignment problem (LAP) to propose a method for computing a solution from the relative interior of this set. Assuming that an arbitrary dual-optimal solution and an optimal assignment are available (for which many efficient algorithms already exist), our method computes a relative-interior solution in linear time. Since the LAP occurs as a subproblem in the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), we employ our method as a new component in the family of dual-ascent algorithms that provide bounds on the optimal value of the QAP. To make our results applicable to the incomplete QAP, which is of interest in practical use-cases, we also provide a linear-time reduction from the incomplete LAP to the complete LAP along with a mapping that preserves optimality and membership in the relative interior. Our experiments on publicly available benchmarks indicate that our approach with relative-interior solution can frequently provide bounds near the optimum of the LP relaxation and its runtime is much lower when compared to a commercial LP solver."
2301.11329,Anatomy-aware and acquisition-agnostic joint registration with   SynthMorph,"Affine image registration is a cornerstone of medical image analysis. While classical algorithms can achieve excellent accuracy, they solve a time-consuming optimization for every image pair. Deep-learning (DL) methods learn a function that maps an image pair to an output transform. Evaluating the function is fast, but capturing large transforms can be challenging, and networks tend to struggle if a test-image characteristic shifts from the training domain, such as resolution. Most affine methods are agnostic to the anatomy the user wishes to align, meaning the registration will be inaccurate if algorithms consider all structures in the image. We address these shortcomings with SynthMorph, a fast, symmetric, diffeomorphic, and easy-to-use DL tool for joint affine-deformable registration of any brain image without preprocessing. First, we leverage a strategy that trains networks with widely varying images synthesized from label maps, yielding robust performance for image types unseen at training. Second, we optimize the spatial overlap of select anatomical labels. This enables networks to distinguish anatomy of interest from irrelevant structures, removing the need for preprocessing that excludes content that may impinge on anatomy-specific registration. Third, we combine the affine model with a deformable hypernetwork that lets users choose the optimal deformation-field regularity for their specific data, at registration time, in a fraction of the time required by classical methods. We analyze how competing architectures learn affine transforms and compare state-of-the-art registration tools across an extremely diverse set of neuroimaging data, aiming to truly capture the behavior of methods in the real world. SynthMorph demonstrates high accuracy and is available at https://w3id.org/synthmorph, as a single complete end-to-end solution for registration of brain MRI."
2301.11405,Discriminative Entropy Clustering and its Relation to K-means and SVM,"Maximization of mutual information between the model's input and output is formally related to ""decisiveness"" and ""fairness"" of the softmax predictions, motivating these unsupervised entropy-based criteria for clustering. First, in the context of linear softmax models, we discuss some general properties of entropy-based clustering. Disproving some earlier claims, we point out fundamental differences with K-means. On the other hand, we prove the margin maximizing property for decisiveness establishing a relation to SVM-based clustering. Second, we propose a new self-labeling formulation of entropy clustering for general softmax models. The pseudo-labels are introduced as auxiliary variables ""splitting"" the fairness and decisiveness. The derived self-labeling loss includes the reverse cross-entropy robust to pseudo-label errors and allows an efficient EM solver for pseudo-labels. Our algorithm improves the state of the art on several standard benchmarks for deep clustering."
2301.11418,Parkinson gait modelling from an anomaly deep representation,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with gait movement disorders, such as bradykinesia, stiffness, tremors and postural instability, caused by progressive dopamine deficiency. Today, some approaches have implemented learning representations to quantify kinematic patterns during locomotion, supporting clinical procedures such as diagnosis and treatment planning. These approaches assumes a large amount of stratified and labeled data to optimize discriminative representations. Nonetheless these considerations may restrict the approaches to be operable in real scenarios during clinical practice. This work introduces a self-supervised generative representation to learn gait-motion-related patterns, under the pretext of video reconstruction and an anomaly detection framework. This architecture is trained following a one-class weakly supervised learning to avoid inter-class variance and approach the multiple relationships that represent locomotion. The proposed approach was validated with 14 PD patients and 23 control subjects, and trained with the control population only, achieving an AUC of 95%, homocedasticity level of 70% and shapeness level of 70% in the classification task considering its generalization."
2301.11514,Deep Industrial Image Anomaly Detection: A Survey,"The recent rapid development of deep learning has laid a milestone in industrial Image Anomaly Detection (IAD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning-based image anomaly detection techniques, from the perspectives of neural network architectures, levels of supervision, loss functions, metrics and datasets. In addition, we extract the new setting from industrial manufacturing and review the current IAD approaches under our proposed our new setting. Moreover, we highlight several opening challenges for image anomaly detection. The merits and downsides of representative network architectures under varying supervision are discussed. Finally, we summarize the research findings and point out future research directions. More resources are available at https://github.com/M-3LAB/awesome-industrial-anomaly-detection."
2301.11564,Learning 6-DoF Fine-grained Grasp Detection Based on Part Affordance   Grounding,"Robotic grasping is a fundamental ability for a robot to interact with the environment. Current methods focus on how to obtain a stable and reliable grasping pose in object level, while little work has been studied on part (shape)-wise grasping which is related to fine-grained grasping and robotic affordance. Parts can be seen as atomic elements to compose an object, which contains rich semantic knowledge and a strong correlation with affordance. However, lacking a large part-wise 3D robotic dataset limits the development of part representation learning and downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new large Language-guided SHape grAsPing datasEt (named LangSHAPE) to promote 3D part-level affordance and grasping ability learning. From the perspective of robotic cognition, we design a two-stage fine-grained robotic grasping framework (named LangPartGPD), including a novel 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware grasp pose detection model, in which explicit language input from human or large language models (LLMs) could guide a robot to generate part-level 6-DoF grasping pose with textual explanation. Our method combines the advantages of human-robot collaboration and LLMs' planning ability using explicit language as a symbolic intermediate. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform 3D part grounding and fine-grained grasp detection experiments on both simulation and physical robot settings, following language instructions across different degrees of textual complexity. Results show our method achieves competitive performance in 3D geometry fine-grained grounding, object affordance inference, and 3D part-aware grasping tasks. Our dataset and code are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/lang-shape"
2301.11631,HyperNeRFGAN: Hypernetwork approach to 3D NeRF GAN,"The recent surge in popularity of deep generative models for 3D objects has highlighted the need for more efficient training methods, particularly given the difficulties associated with training with conventional 3D representations, such as voxels or point clouds. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which provide the current benchmark in terms of quality for the generation of novel views of complex 3D scenes from a limited set of 2D images, represent a promising solution to this challenge. However, the training of these models requires the knowledge of the respective camera positions from which the images were viewed. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by introducing HyperNeRFGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture employing a hypernetwork paradigm to transform a Gaussian noise into the weights of a NeRF architecture that does not utilize viewing directions in its training phase. Consequently, as evidenced by the findings of our experimental study, the proposed model, despite its notable simplicity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art alternatives, demonstrates superior performance on a diverse range of image datasets where camera position estimation is challenging, particularly in the context of medical data."
2301.11915,Understanding Self-Supervised Pretraining with Part-Aware Representation   Learning,"In this paper, we are interested in understanding self-supervised pretraining through studying the capability that self-supervised representation pretraining methods learn part-aware representations. The study is mainly motivated by that random views, used in contrastive learning, and random masked (visible) patches, used in masked image modeling, are often about object parts.   We explain that contrastive learning is a part-to-whole task: the projection layer hallucinates the whole object representation from the object part representation learned from the encoder, and that masked image modeling is a part-to-part task: the masked patches of the object are hallucinated from the visible patches. The explanation suggests that the self-supervised pretrained encoder is required to understand the object part. We empirically compare the off-the-shelf encoders pretrained with several representative methods on object-level recognition and part-level recognition. The results show that the fully-supervised model outperforms self-supervised models for object-level recognition, and most self-supervised contrastive learning and masked image modeling methods outperform the fully-supervised method for part-level recognition. It is observed that the combination of contrastive learning and masked image modeling further improves the performance."
2301.12334,Don't Play Favorites: Minority Guidance for Diffusion Models,"We explore the problem of generating minority samples using diffusion models. The minority samples are instances that lie on low-density regions of a data manifold. Generating a sufficient number of such minority instances is important, since they often contain some unique attributes of the data. However, the conventional generation process of the diffusion models mostly yields majority samples (that lie on high-density regions of the manifold) due to their high likelihoods, making themselves ineffective and time-consuming for the minority generating task. In this work, we present a novel framework that can make the generation process of the diffusion models focus on the minority samples. We first highlight that Tweedie's denoising formula yields favorable results for majority samples. The observation motivates us to introduce a metric that describes the uniqueness of a given sample. To address the inherent preference of the diffusion models w.r.t. the majority samples, we further develop minority guidance, a sampling technique that can guide the generation process toward regions with desired likelihood levels. Experiments on benchmark real datasets demonstrate that our minority guidance can greatly improve the capability of generating high-quality minority samples over existing generative samplers. We showcase that the performance benefit of our framework persists even in demanding real-world scenarios such as medical imaging, further underscoring the practical significance of our work. Code is available at https://github.com/soobin-um/minority-guidance."
2301.12511,Fast-BEV: A Fast and Strong Bird's-Eye View Perception Baseline,"Recently, perception task based on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation has drawn more and more attention, and BEV representation is promising as the foundation for next-generation Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception. However, most existing BEV solutions either require considerable resources to execute on-vehicle inference or suffer from modest performance. This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, termed Fast-BEV , which is capable of performing faster BEV perception on the on-vehicle chips. Towards this goal, we first empirically find that the BEV representation can be sufficiently powerful without expensive transformer based transformation nor depth representation. Our Fast-BEV consists of five parts, We novelly propose (1) a lightweight deployment-friendly view transformation which fast transfers 2D image feature to 3D voxel space, (2) an multi-scale image encoder which leverages multi-scale information for better performance, (3) an efficient BEV encoder which is particularly designed to speed up on-vehicle inference. We further introduce (4) a strong data augmentation strategy for both image and BEV space to avoid over-fitting, (5) a multi-frame feature fusion mechanism to leverage the temporal information. Through experiments, on 2080Ti platform, our R50 model can run 52.6 FPS with 47.3% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, exceeding the 41.3 FPS and 47.5% NDS of the BEVDepth-R50 model and 30.2 FPS and 45.7% NDS of the BEVDet4D-R50 model. Our largest model (R101@900x1600) establishes a competitive 53.5% NDS on the nuScenes validation set. We further develop a benchmark with considerable accuracy and efficiency on current popular on-vehicle chips. The code is released at: https://github.com/Sense-GVT/Fast-BEV."
2301.12515,LiDAR-CS Dataset: LiDAR Point Cloud Dataset with Cross-Sensors for 3D   Object Detection,"Over the past few years, there has been remarkable progress in research on 3D point clouds and their use in autonomous driving scenarios has become widespread. However, deep learning methods heavily rely on annotated data and often face domain generalization issues. Unlike 2D images whose domains usually pertain to the texture information present in them, the features derived from a 3D point cloud are affected by the distribution of the points. The lack of a 3D domain adaptation benchmark leads to the common practice of training a model on one benchmark (e.g. Waymo) and then assessing it on another dataset (e.g. KITTI). This setting results in two distinct domain gaps: scenarios and sensors, making it difficult to analyze and evaluate the method accurately. To tackle this problem, this paper presents LiDAR Dataset with Cross Sensors (LiDAR-CS Dataset), which contains large-scale annotated LiDAR point cloud under six groups of different sensors but with the same corresponding scenarios, captured from hybrid realistic LiDAR simulator. To our knowledge, LiDAR-CS Dataset is the first dataset that addresses the sensor-related gaps in the domain of 3D object detection in real traffic. Furthermore, we evaluate and analyze the performance using various baseline detectors and demonstrated its potential applications. Project page: https://opendriving.github.io/lidar-cs."
2301.12541,Supervised and Contrastive Self-Supervised In-Domain Representation   Learning for Dense Prediction Problems in Remote Sensing,"In recent years Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made significant progress in computer vision. These advancements have been applied to other areas, such as remote sensing and have shown satisfactory results. However, the lack of large labeled datasets and the inherent complexity of remote sensing problems have made it difficult to train deep CNNs for dense prediction problems. To solve this issue, ImageNet pretrained weights have been used as a starting point in various dense predictions tasks. Although this type of transfer learning has led to improvements, the domain difference between natural and remote sensing images has also limited the performance of deep CNNs. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods for learning visual representations from large unlabeled images have grown substantially over the past two years. Accordingly, in this paper we have explored the effectiveness of in-domain representations in both supervised and self-supervised forms to solve the domain difference between remote sensing and the ImageNet dataset. The obtained weights from remote sensing images are utilized as initial weights for solving semantic segmentation and object detection tasks and state-of-the-art results are obtained. For self-supervised pre-training, we have utilized the SimSiam algorithm as it is simple and does not need huge computational resources. One of the most influential factors in acquiring general visual representations from remote sensing images is the pre-training dataset. To examine the effect of the pre-training dataset, equal-sized remote sensing datasets are used for pre-training. Our results have demonstrated that using datasets with a high spatial resolution for self-supervised representation learning leads to high performance in downstream tasks."
2301.12554,Improving the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off of Classifiers via Adaptive   Smoothing,"While prior research has proposed a plethora of methods that build neural classifiers robust against adversarial robustness, practitioners are still reluctant to adopt them due to their unacceptably severe clean accuracy penalties. This paper significantly alleviates this accuracy-robustness trade-off by mixing the output probabilities of a standard classifier and a robust classifier, where the standard network is optimized for clean accuracy and is not robust in general. We show that the robust base classifier's confidence difference for correct and incorrect examples is the key to this improvement. In addition to providing intuitions and empirical evidence, we theoretically certify the robustness of the mixed classifier under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we adapt an adversarial input detector into a mixing network that adaptively adjusts the mixture of the two base models, further reducing the accuracy penalty of achieving robustness. The proposed flexible method, termed ""adaptive smoothing"", can work in conjunction with existing or even future methods that improve clean accuracy, robustness, or adversary detection. Our empirical evaluation considers strong attack methods, including AutoAttack and adaptive attack. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, our method achieves an 85.21% clean accuracy while maintaining a 38.72% $\ell_\infty$-AutoAttacked ($\epsilon = 8/255$) accuracy, becoming the second most robust method on the RobustBench CIFAR-100 benchmark as of submission, while improving the clean accuracy by ten percentage points compared with all listed models. The code that implements our method is available at https://github.com/Bai-YT/AdaptiveSmoothing."
2301.12744,PointSmile: Point Self-supervised Learning via Curriculum Mutual   Information,"Self-supervised learning is attracting wide attention in point cloud processing. However, it is still not well-solved to gain discriminative and transferable features of point clouds for efficient training on downstream tasks, due to their natural sparsity and irregularity. We propose PointSmile, a reconstruction-free self-supervised learning paradigm by maximizing curriculum mutual information (CMI) across the replicas of point cloud objects. From the perspective of how-and-what-to-learn, PointSmile is designed to imitate human curriculum learning, i.e., starting with an easy curriculum and gradually increasing the difficulty of that curriculum. To solve ""how-to-learn"", we introduce curriculum data augmentation (CDA) of point clouds. CDA encourages PointSmile to learn from easy samples to hard ones, such that the latent space can be dynamically affected to create better embeddings. To solve ""what-to-learn"", we propose to maximize both feature- and class-wise CMI, for better extracting discriminative features of point clouds. Unlike most of existing methods, PointSmile does not require a pretext task, nor does it require cross-modal data to yield rich latent representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PointSmile in downstream tasks including object classification and segmentation. Extensive results show that our PointSmile outperforms existing self-supervised methods, and compares favorably with popular fully-supervised methods on various standard architectures."
2301.12831,M3FAS: An Accurate and Robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing   System,"Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3). We propose a multi-head training strategy, allowing the model to output predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, resulting in a more flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness, and flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings.

2301.12943,Factors that affect Camera based Self-Monitoring of Vitals in the Wild,"The reliability of the results of self monitoring of the vitals in the wild using medical devices or wearables or camera based smart phone solutions is subject to variabilities such as position of placement, hardware of the device and environmental factors. In this first of its kind study, we demonstrate that this variability in self monitoring of Blood Pressure (BP), Blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and Heart rate (HR) is statistically significant (p<0.05) on 203 healthy subjects by quantifying positional and hardware variability. We also establish the existence of this variability in camera based solutions for self-monitoring of vitals in smart phones and thus prove that the use of camera based smart phone solutions is similar to the use of medical devices or wearables for self-monitoring in the wild."
2301.13014,Attribute-Guided Multi-Level Attention Network for Fine-Grained Fashion   Retrieval,"Fine-grained fashion retrieval searches for items that share a similar attribute with the query image. Most existing methods use a pre-trained feature extractor (e.g., ResNet 50) to capture image representations. However, a pre-trained feature backbone is typically trained for image classification and object detection, which are fundamentally different tasks from fine-grained fashion retrieval. Therefore, existing methods suffer from a feature gap problem when directly using the pre-trained backbone for fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we introduce an attribute-guided multi-level attention network (AG-MAN). Specifically, we first enhance the pre-trained feature extractor to capture multi-level image embedding, thereby enriching the low-level features within these representations. Then, we propose a classification scheme where images with the same attribute, albeit with different values, are categorized into the same class. This can further alleviate the feature gap problem by perturbing object-centric feature learning. Moreover, we propose an improved attribute-guided attention module for extracting more accurate attribute-specific representations. Our model consistently outperforms existing attention based methods when assessed on the FashionAI (62.8788% in MAP), DeepFashion (8.9804% in MAP), and Zappos50k datasets (93.32% in Prediction accuracy). Especially, ours improves the most typical ASENet_V2 model by 2.12%, 0.31%, and 0.78% points in FashionAI, DeepFashion, and Zappos50k datasets, respectively. The source code is available in https://github.com/Dr-LingXiao/AG-MAN."
2301.13096,Language-Driven Anchors for Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Previous researches mainly focus on improving adversarial robustness in the fully supervised setting, leaving the challenging domain of zero-shot adversarial robustness an open question. In this work, we investigate this domain by leveraging the recent advances in large vision-language models, such as CLIP, to introduce zero-shot adversarial robustness to DNNs. We propose LAAT, a Language-driven, Anchor-based Adversarial Training strategy. LAAT utilizes the features of a text encoder for each category as fixed anchors (normalized feature embeddings) for each category, which are then employed for adversarial training. By leveraging the semantic consistency of the text encoders, LAAT aims to enhance the adversarial robustness of the image model on novel categories. However, naively using text encoders leads to poor results. Through analysis, we identified the issue to be the high cosine similarity between text encoders. We then design an expansion algorithm and an alignment cross-entropy loss to alleviate the problem. Our experimental results demonstrated that LAAT significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods. LAAT has the potential to enhance adversarial robustness by large-scale multimodal models, especially when labeled data is unavailable during training."
2301.13128,Standardized CycleGAN training for unsupervised stain adaptation in   invasive carcinoma classification for breast histopathology,"Generalization is one of the main challenges of computational pathology. Slide preparation heterogeneity and the diversity of scanners lead to poor model performance when used on data from medical centers not seen during training. In order to achieve stain invariance in breast invasive carcinoma patch classification, we implement a stain translation strategy using cycleGANs for unsupervised image-to-image translation. We compare three cycleGAN-based approaches to a baseline classification model obtained without any stain invariance strategy. Two of the proposed approaches use cycleGAN's translations at inference or training in order to build stain-specific classification models. The last method uses them for stain data augmentation during training. This constrains the classification model to learn stain-invariant features. Baseline metrics are set by training and testing the baseline classification model on a reference stain. We assessed performances using three medical centers with H&E and H&E&S staining. Every approach tested in this study improves baseline metrics without needing labels on target stains. The stain augmentation-based approach produced the best results on every stain. Each method's pros and cons are studied and discussed in this paper. However, training highly performing cycleGANs models in itself represents a challenge. In this work, we introduce a systematical method for optimizing cycleGAN training by setting a novel stopping criterion. This method has the benefit of not requiring any visual inspection of cycleGAN results and proves superiority to methods using a predefined number of training epochs. In addition, we also study the minimal amount of data required for cycleGAN training."
2301.13156,SeaFormer++: Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer for Mobile Visual   Recognition,"Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone. Our code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/fudan-zvg/SeaFormer."
2301.13330,"Efficient and Effective Methods for Mixed Precision Neural Network   Quantization for Faster, Energy-efficient Inference","For efficient neural network inference, it is desirable to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with the simplest networks requiring the least computation, memory, and power. Quantizing networks to lower precision is a powerful technique for simplifying networks. As each layer of a network may have different sensitivity to quantization, mixed precision quantization methods selectively tune the precision of individual layers to achieve a minimum drop in task performance (e.g., accuracy). To estimate the impact of layer precision choice on task performance, two methods are introduced: i) Entropy Approximation Guided Layer selection (EAGL) is fast and uses the entropy of the weight distribution, and ii) Accuracy-aware Layer Precision Selection (ALPS) is straightforward and relies on single epoch fine-tuning after layer precision reduction. Using EAGL and ALPS for layer precision selection, full-precision accuracy is recovered with a mix of 4-bit and 2-bit layers for ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and BERT-base transformer networks, demonstrating enhanced performance across the entire accuracy-throughput frontier. The techniques demonstrate better performance than existing techniques in several commensurate comparisons. Notably, this is accomplished with significantly lesser computational time required to reach a solution."
2301.13337,DAFD: Domain Adaptation via Feature Disentanglement for Image   Classification,"A good feature representation is the key to image classification. In practice, image classifiers may be applied in scenarios different from what they have been trained on. This so-called domain shift leads to a significant performance drop in image classification. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) reduces the domain shift by transferring the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. We perform feature disentanglement for UDA by distilling category-relevant features and excluding category-irrelevant features from the global feature maps. This disentanglement prevents the network from overfitting to category-irrelevant information and makes it focus on information useful for classification. This reduces the difficulty of domain alignment and improves the classification accuracy on the target domain. We propose a coarse-to-fine domain adaptation method called Domain Adaptation via Feature Disentanglement~(DAFD), which has two components: (1)the Category-Relevant Feature Selection (CRFS) module, which disentangles the category-relevant features from the category-irrelevant features, and (2)the Dynamic Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DLMMD) module, which achieves fine-grained alignment by reducing the discrepancy within the category-relevant features from different domains. Combined with the CRFS, the DLMMD module can align the category-relevant features properly. We conduct comprehensive experiment on four standard datasets. Our results clearly demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in domain adaptive image classification tasks and its competitiveness to the state of the art."
2301.13359,IM-IAD: Industrial Image Anomaly Detection Benchmark in Manufacturing,"Image anomaly detection (IAD) is an emerging and vital computer vision task in industrial manufacturing (IM). Recently, many advanced algorithms have been reported, but their performance deviates considerably with various IM settings. We realize that the lack of a uniform IM benchmark is hindering the development and usage of IAD methods in real-world applications. In addition, it is difficult for researchers to analyze IAD algorithms without a uniform benchmark. To solve this problem, we propose a uniform IM benchmark, for the first time, to assess how well these algorithms perform, which includes various levels of supervision (unsupervised versus fully supervised), learning paradigms (few-shot, continual and noisy label), and efficiency (memory usage and inference speed). Then, we construct a comprehensive image anomaly detection benchmark (IM-IAD), which includes 19 algorithms on seven major datasets with a uniform setting. Extensive experiments (17,017 total) on IM-IAD provide in-depth insights into IAD algorithm redesign or selection. Moreover, the proposed IM-IAD benchmark challenges existing algorithms and suggests future research directions. To foster reproducibility and accessibility, the source code of IM-IAD is uploaded on the website, https://github.com/M-3LAB/IM-IAD."
2301.13418,BRAIxDet: Learning to Detect Malignant Breast Lesion with Incomplete   Annotations,"Methods to detect malignant lesions from screening mammograms are usually trained with fully annotated datasets, where images are labelled with the localisation and classification of cancerous lesions. However, real-world screening mammogram datasets commonly have a subset that is fully annotated and another subset that is weakly annotated with just the global classification (i.e., without lesion localisation). Given the large size of such datasets, researchers usually face a dilemma with the weakly annotated subset: to not use it or to fully annotate it. The first option will reduce detection accuracy because it does not use the whole dataset, and the second option is too expensive given that the annotation needs to be done by expert radiologists. In this paper, we propose a middle-ground solution for the dilemma, which is to formulate the training as a weakly- and semi-supervised learning problem that we refer to as malignant breast lesion detection with incomplete annotations. To address this problem, our new method comprises two stages, namely: 1) pre-training a multi-view mammogram classifier with weak supervision from the whole dataset, and 2) extending the trained classifier to become a multi-view detector that is trained with semi-supervised student-teacher learning, where the training set contains fully and weakly-annotated mammograms. We provide extensive detection results on two real-world screening mammogram datasets containing incomplete annotations, and show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the detection of malignant breast lesions with incomplete annotations."
2301.13530,Domain-Generalizable Multiple-Domain Clustering,"This work generalizes the problem of unsupervised domain generalization to the case in which no labeled samples are available (completely unsupervised). We are given unlabeled samples from multiple source domains, and we aim to learn a shared predictor that assigns examples to semantically related clusters. Evaluation is done by predicting cluster assignments in previously unseen domains. Towards this goal, we propose a two-stage training framework: (1) self-supervised pre-training for extracting domain invariant semantic features. (2) multi-head cluster prediction with pseudo labels, which rely on both the feature space and cluster head prediction, further leveraging a novel prediction-based label smoothing scheme. We demonstrate empirically that our model is more accurate than baselines that require fine-tuning using samples from the target domain or some level of supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/AmitRozner/domain-generalizable-multiple-domain-clustering."
2301.13656,A Survey and Benchmark of Automatic Surface Reconstruction from Point   Clouds,"We present a comprehensive survey and benchmark of both traditional and learning-based methods for surface reconstruction from point clouds. This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors such as noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can require tedious hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluate various time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. When both trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, the learning-based models consistently produce higher-quality surfaces compared to their traditional counterparts -- even in scenarios involving novel shape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilience to the diverse anomalies commonly found in real-world 3D acquisitions. For the benefit of the research community, we make our code and datasets available, inviting further enhancements to learning-based surface reconstruction. This can be accessed at https://github.com/raphaelsulzer/dsr-benchmark ."
2301.13803,Fairness-aware Vision Transformer via Debiased Self-Attention,"Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently gained significant attention in solving computer vision (CV) problems due to its capability of extracting informative features and modeling long-range dependencies through the attention mechanism. Whereas recent works have explored the trustworthiness of ViT, including its robustness and explainability, the issue of fairness has not yet been adequately addressed. We establish that the existing fairness-aware algorithms designed for CNNs do not perform well on ViT, which highlights the need to develop our novel framework via Debiased Self-Attention (DSA). DSA is a fairness-through-blindness approach that enforces ViT to eliminate spurious features correlated with the sensitive label for bias mitigation and simultaneously retain real features for target prediction. Notably, DSA leverages adversarial examples to locate and mask the spurious features in the input image patches with an additional attention weights alignment regularizer in the training objective to encourage learning real features for target prediction. Importantly, our DSA framework leads to improved fairness guarantees over prior works on multiple prediction tasks without compromising target prediction performance. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/qiangyao1988/DSA}{https://github.com/qiangyao1988/DSA}."
2302.00290,MS-DETR: Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Transformer with Loosely   Coupled Fusion and Modality-Balanced Optimization,"Multispectral pedestrian detection is an important task for many around-the-clock applications, since the visible and thermal modalities can provide complementary information especially under low light conditions. Due to the presence of two modalities, misalignment and modality imbalance are the most significant issues in multispectral pedestrian detection. In this paper, we propose M ulti S pectral pedestrian DE tection TR ansformer (MS-DETR) to fix above issues. MS-DETR consists of two modality-specific backbones and Transformer encoders, followed by a multi-modal Transformer decoder, and the visible and thermal features are fused in the multi-modal Transformer decoder. To well resist the misalignment between multi-modal images, we design a loosely coupled fusion strategy by sparsely sampling some keypoints from multi-modal features independently and fusing them with adaptively learned attention weights. Moreover, based on the insight that not only different modalities, but also different pedestrian instances tend to have different confidence scores to final detection, we further propose an instance-aware modality-balanced optimization strategy, which preserves visible and thermal decoder branches and aligns their predicted slots through an instance-wise dynamic loss. Our end-to-end MS-DETR shows superior performance on the challenging KAIST, CVC-14 and LLVIP benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/MS-DETR."
2302.00487,"A Comprehensive Survey of Continual Learning: Theory, Method and   Application","To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, accumulate, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. In a general sense, continual learning is explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance degradation of the old tasks. Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications. Based on existing theoretical and empirical results, we summarize the general objectives of continual learning as ensuring a proper stability-plasticity trade-off and an adequate intra/inter-task generalizability in the context of resource efficiency. Then we provide a state-of-the-art and elaborated taxonomy, extensively analyzing how representative methods address continual learning, and how they are adapted to particular challenges in realistic applications. Through an in-depth discussion of promising directions, we believe that such a holistic perspective can greatly facilitate subsequent exploration in this field and beyond."
2302.00509,Exploring Semantic Perturbations on Grover,"With news and information being as easy to access as they currently are, it is more important than ever to ensure that people are not mislead by what they read. Recently, the rise of neural fake news (AI-generated fake news) and its demonstrated effectiveness at fooling humans has prompted the development of models to detect it. One such model is the Grover model, which can both detect neural fake news to prevent it, and generate it to demonstrate how a model could be misused to fool human readers. In this work we explore the Grover model's fake news detection capabilities by performing targeted attacks through perturbations on input news articles. Through this we test Grover's resilience to these adversarial attacks and expose some potential vulnerabilities which should be addressed in further iterations to ensure it can detect all types of fake news accurately."
2302.00556,Correspondence-free online human motion retargeting,"We present a data-driven framework for unsupervised human motion retargeting that animates a target subject with the motion of a source subject. Our method is correspondence-free, requiring neither spatial correspondences between the source and target shapes nor temporal correspondences between different frames of the source motion. This allows to animate a target shape with arbitrary sequences of humans in motion, possibly captured using 4D acquisition platforms or consumer devices. Our method unifies the advantages of two existing lines of work, namely skeletal motion retargeting, which leverages long-term temporal context, and surface-based retargeting, which preserves surface details, by combining a geometry-aware deformation model with a skeleton-aware motion transfer approach. This allows to take into account long-term temporal context while accounting for surface details. During inference, our method runs online, i.e. input can be processed in a serial way, and retargeting is performed in a single forward pass per frame. Experiments show that including long-term temporal context during training improves the method's accuracy for skeletal motion and detail preservation. Furthermore, our method generalizes to unobserved motions and body shapes. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two test datasets and that it can be used to animate human models with the output of a multi-view acquisition platform. Code is available at \url{https://gitlab.inria.fr/rrekikdi/human-motion-retargeting2023}."
2302.00816,Dynamic Atomic Column Detection in Transmission Electron Microscopy   Videos via Ridge Estimation,"Ridge detection is a classical tool to extract curvilinear features in image processing. As such, it has great promise in applications to material science problems; specifically, for trend filtering relatively stable atom-shaped objects in image sequences, such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) videos. Standard analysis of TEM videos is limited to frame-by-frame object recognition. We instead harness temporal correlation across frames through simultaneous analysis of long image sequences, specified as a spatio-temporal image tensor. We define new ridge detection algorithms to non-parametrically estimate explicit trajectories of atomic-level object locations as a continuous function of time. Our approach is specially tailored to handle temporal analysis of objects that seemingly stochastically disappear and subsequently reappear throughout a sequence. We demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective and efficient in simulation scenarios, and delivers notable performance improvements in TEM experiments compared to other material science benchmarks."
2302.00833,RobustNeRF: Ignoring Distractors with Robust Losses,"Neural radiance fields (NeRF) excel at synthesizing new views given multi-view, calibrated images of a static scene. When scenes include distractors, which are not persistent during image capture (moving objects, lighting variations, shadows), artifacts appear as view-dependent effects or 'floaters'. To cope with distractors, we advocate a form of robust estimation for NeRF training, modeling distractors in training data as outliers of an optimization problem. Our method successfully removes outliers from a scene and improves upon our baselines, on synthetic and real-world scenes. Our technique is simple to incorporate in modern NeRF frameworks, with few hyper-parameters. It does not assume a priori knowledge of the types of distractors, and is instead focused on the optimization problem rather than pre-processing or modeling transient objects. More results on our page https://robustnerf.github.io."
2302.00923,Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. However, existing CoT studies have primarily focused on the language modality. We propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates language (text) and vision (images) modalities into a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference. In this way, answer inference can leverage better generated rationales that are based on multimodal information. Experimental results on ScienceQA and A-OKVQA benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScienceQA benchmark. Our analysis indicates that Multimodal-CoT offers the advantages of mitigating hallucination and enhancing convergence speed. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/mm-cot."
2302.01034,An Efficient Convex Hull-based Vehicle Pose Estimation Method for 3D   LiDAR,"Vehicle pose estimation with LiDAR is essential in the perception technology of autonomous driving. However, due to incomplete observation measurements and sparsity of the LiDAR point cloud, it is challenging to achieve satisfactory pose extraction based on 3D LiDAR with the existing pose estimation methods. In addition, the demand for real-time performance further increases the difficulty of the pose estimation task. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle pose estimation method based on the convex hull. The extracted 3D cluster is reduced to the convex hull, reducing the subsequent computation burden while preserving essential contour information. Subsequently, a novel criterion based on the minimum occlusion area is developed for the search-based algorithm, enabling accurate pose estimation. Additionally, this criterion renders the proposed algorithm particularly well-suited for obstacle avoidance. The proposed algorithm is validated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired at an industrial park. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better accuracy than the classical pose estimation method while maintaining real-time speed."
2302.01089,Curriculum Learning for ab initio Deep Learned Refractive Optics,"Deep optical optimization has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing computational imaging systems using only the output image as the objective. However, it has been limited to either simple optical systems consisting of a single element such as a diffractive optical element (DOE) or metalens, or the fine-tuning of compound lenses from good initial designs. Here we present a DeepLens design method based on curriculum learning, which is able to learn optical designs of compound lenses ab initio from randomly initialized surfaces without human intervention, therefore overcoming the need for a good initial design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by fully automatically designing both classical imaging lenses and a large field-of-view extended depth-of-field computational lens in a cellphone-style form factor, with highly aspheric surfaces and a short back focal length."
2302.01540,DEVICE: Depth and Visual Concepts Aware Transformer for OCR-based Image   Captioning,"OCR-based image captioning is an important but under-explored task, aiming to generate descriptions containing visual objects and scene text. Recent studies have made encouraging progress, but they are still suffering from a lack of overall understanding of scenes and generating inaccurate captions. One possible reason is that current studies mainly focus on constructing the plane-level geometric relationship of scene text without depth information. This leads to insufficient scene text relational reasoning so that models may describe scene text inaccurately. The other possible reason is that existing methods fail to generate fine-grained descriptions of some visual objects. In addition, they may ignore essential visual objects, leading to the scene text belonging to these ignored objects not being utilized. To address the above issues, we propose a Depth and Visual Concepts Aware Transformer (DEVICE) for OCR-based image captinong. Concretely, to construct three-dimensional geometric relations, we introduce depth information and propose a depth-enhanced feature updating module to ameliorate OCR token features. To generate more precise and comprehensive captions, we introduce semantic features of detected visual concepts as auxiliary information, and propose a semantic-guided alignment module to improve the model's ability to utilize visual concepts. Our DEVICE is capable of comprehending scenes more comprehensively and boosting the accuracy of described visual entities. Sufficient experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEVICE, which outperforms state-of-the-art models on the TextCaps test set."
2302.01541,Contrastive Learning with Consistent Representations,"Contrastive learning demonstrates great promise for representation learning. Data augmentations play a critical role in contrastive learning by providing informative views of the data without necessitating explicit labels. Nonetheless, the efficacy of current methodologies heavily hinges on the quality of employed data augmentation (DA) functions, often chosen manually from a limited set of options. While exploiting diverse data augmentations is appealing, the complexities inherent in both DAs and representation learning can lead to performance deterioration. Addressing this challenge and facilitating the systematic incorporation of diverse data augmentations, this paper proposes Contrastive Learning with Consistent Representations CoCor. At the heart of CoCor is a novel consistency metric termed DA consistency. This metric governs the mapping of augmented input data to the representation space, ensuring that these instances are positioned optimally in a manner consistent with the applied intensity of the DA. Moreover, we propose to learn the optimal mapping locations as a function of DA, all while preserving a desired monotonic property relative to DA intensity. Experimental results demonstrate that CoCor notably enhances the generalizability and transferability of learned representations in comparison to baseline methods."
2302.01585,SegForestNet: Spatial-Partitioning-Based Aerial Image Segmentation,"Aerial image segmentation is the basis for applications such as automatically creating maps or tracking deforestation. In true orthophotos, which are often used in these applications, many objects and regions can be approximated well by polygons. However, this fact is rarely exploited by state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. Instead, most models allow unnecessary degrees of freedom in their predictions by allowing arbitrary region shapes. We therefore present a refinement of our deep learning model which predicts binary space partitioning trees, an efficient polygon representation. The refinements include a new feature decoder architecture and a new differentiable BSP tree renderer which both avoid vanishing gradients. Additionally, we designed a novel loss function specifically designed to improve the spatial partitioning defined by the predicted trees. Furthermore, our expanded model can predict multiple trees at once and thus can predict class-specific segmentations. As an additional contribution, we investigate the impact of a non-optimal training process in comparison to an optimized training process. While model architectures optimized for aerial images, such as PFNet or our own model, show an advantage under non-optimal conditions, this advantage disappears under optimal training conditions. Despite this observation, our model still makes better predictions for small rectangular objects, e.g., cars."
2302.01622,"Private, fair and accurate: Training large-scale, privacy-preserving AI   models in medical imaging","Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly used in the medical domain. However, as medical data is highly sensitive, special precautions to ensure its protection are required. The gold standard for privacy preservation is the introduction of differential privacy (DP) to model training. Prior work indicates that DP has negative implications on model accuracy and fairness, which are unacceptable in medicine and represent a main barrier to the widespread use of privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we evaluated the effect of privacy-preserving training of AI models regarding accuracy and fairness compared to non-private training. For this, we used two datasets: (1) A large dataset (N=193,311) of high quality clinical chest radiographs, and (2) a dataset (N=1,625) of 3D abdominal computed tomography (CT) images, with the task of classifying the presence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Both were retrospectively collected and manually labeled by experienced radiologists. We then compared non-private deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and privacy-preserving (DP) models with respect to privacy-utility trade-offs measured as area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUROC), and privacy-fairness trade-offs, measured as Pearson's r or Statistical Parity Difference. We found that, while the privacy-preserving trainings yielded lower accuracy, they did largely not amplify discrimination against age, sex or co-morbidity. Our study shows that -- under the challenging realistic circumstances of a real-life clinical dataset -- the privacy-preserving training of diagnostic deep learning models is possible with excellent diagnostic accuracy and fairness."
2302.01647,Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning at Scale,"Current state-of-the-art deep networks are all powered by backpropagation. In this paper, we explore alternatives to full backpropagation in the form of blockwise learning rules, leveraging the latest developments in self-supervised learning. We show that a blockwise pretraining procedure consisting of training independently the 4 main blocks of layers of a ResNet-50 with Barlow Twins' loss function at each block performs almost as well as end-to-end backpropagation on ImageNet: a linear probe trained on top of our blockwise pretrained model obtains a top-1 classification accuracy of 70.48%, only 1.1% below the accuracy of an end-to-end pretrained network (71.57% accuracy). We perform extensive experiments to understand the impact of different components within our method and explore a variety of adaptations of self-supervised learning to the blockwise paradigm, building an exhaustive understanding of the critical avenues for scaling local learning rules to large networks, with implications ranging from hardware design to neuroscience."
2302.01790,Understanding metric-related pitfalls in image analysis validation,"Validation metrics are key for the reliable tracking of scientific progress and for bridging the current chasm between artificial intelligence (AI) research and its translation into practice. However, increasing evidence shows that particularly in image analysis, metrics are often chosen inadequately in relation to the underlying research problem. This could be attributed to a lack of accessibility of metric-related knowledge: While taking into account the individual strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of validation metrics is a critical prerequisite to making educated choices, the relevant knowledge is currently scattered and poorly accessible to individual researchers. Based on a multi-stage Delphi process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert consortium as well as extensive community feedback, the present work provides the first reliable and comprehensive common point of access to information on pitfalls related to validation metrics in image analysis. Focusing on biomedical image analysis but with the potential of transfer to other fields, the addressed pitfalls generalize across application domains and are categorized according to a newly created, domain-agnostic taxonomy. To facilitate comprehension, illustrations and specific examples accompany each pitfall. As a structured body of information accessible to researchers of all levels of expertise, this work enhances global comprehension of a key topic in image analysis validation."
2302.02070,Semantic-Guided Generative Image Augmentation Method with Diffusion   Models for Image Classification,"Existing image augmentation methods consist of two categories: perturbation-based methods and generative methods. Perturbation-based methods apply pre-defined perturbations to augment an original image, but only locally vary the image, thus lacking image diversity. In contrast, generative methods bring more image diversity in the augmented images but may not preserve semantic consistency, thus incorrectly changing the essential semantics of the original image. To balance image diversity and semantic consistency in augmented images, we propose SGID, a Semantic-guided Generative Image augmentation method with Diffusion models for image classification. Specifically, SGID employs diffusion models to generate augmented images with good image diversity. More importantly, SGID takes image labels and captions as guidance to maintain semantic consistency between the augmented and original images. Experimental results show that SGID outperforms the best augmentation baseline by 1.72% on ResNet-50 (from scratch), 0.33% on ViT (ImageNet-21k), and 0.14% on CLIP-ViT (LAION-2B). Moreover, SGID can be combined with other image augmentation baselines and further improves the overall performance. We demonstrate the semantic consistency and image diversity of SGID through quantitative human and automated evaluations, as well as qualitative case studies."
2302.02108,Knowledge Distillation in Vision Transformers: A Critical Review,"In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformers have already revolutionized the field by utilizing an attention-based encoder-decoder model. Recently, some pioneering works have employed Transformer-like architectures in Computer Vision (CV) and they have reported outstanding performance of these architectures in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance improvements over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their competitive modelling capabilities. However, these architectures demand massive computational resources which makes these models difficult to be deployed in the resource-constrained applications. Many solutions have been developed to combat this issue, such as compressive transformers and compression functions such as dilated convolution, min-max pooling, 1D convolution, etc. Model compression has recently attracted considerable research attention as a potential remedy. A number of model compression methods have been proposed in the literature such as weight quantization, weight multiplexing, pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, techniques like weight quantization, pruning and weight multiplexing typically involve complex pipelines for performing the compression. KD has been found to be a simple and much effective model compression technique that allows a relatively simple model to perform tasks almost as accurately as a complex model. This paper discusses various approaches based upon KD for effective compression of ViT models. The paper elucidates the role played by KD in reducing the computational and memory requirements of these models. The paper also presents the various challenges faced by ViTs that are yet to be resolved."
2302.02150,This Intestine Does Not Exist: Multiscale Residual Variational   Autoencoder for Realistic Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Image Generation,"Medical image synthesis has emerged as a promising solution to address the limited availability of annotated medical data needed for training machine learning algorithms in the context of image-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems. To this end, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been mainly applied to support the algorithm training process by generating synthetic images for data augmentation. However, in the field of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE), the limited content diversity and size of existing publicly available annotated datasets, adversely affect both the training stability and synthesis performance of GANs. Aiming to a viable solution for WCE image synthesis, a novel Variational Autoencoder architecture is proposed, namely ""This Intestine Does not Exist"" (TIDE). The proposed architecture comprises multiscale feature extraction convolutional blocks and residual connections, which enable the generation of high-quality and diverse datasets even with a limited number of training images. Contrary to the current approaches, which are oriented towards the augmentation of the available datasets, this study demonstrates that using TIDE, real WCE datasets can be fully substituted by artificially generated ones, without compromising classification performance. Furthermore, qualitative and user evaluation studies by experienced WCE specialists, validate from a medical viewpoint that both the normal and abnormal WCE images synthesized by TIDE are sufficiently realistic."
2302.02181,Model Stitching and Visualization How GAN Generators can Invert Networks   in Real-Time,"In this work, we propose a fast and accurate method to reconstruct activations of classification and semantic segmentation networks by stitching them with a GAN generator utilizing a 1x1 convolution. We test our approach on images of animals from the AFHQ wild dataset, ImageNet1K, and real-world digital pathology scans of stained tissue samples. Our results show comparable performance to established gradient descent methods but with a processing time that is two orders of magnitude faster, making this approach promising for practical applications."
2302.02213,CosPGD: an efficient white-box adversarial attack for pixel-wise   prediction tasks,"While neural networks allow highly accurate predictions in many tasks, their lack of robustness towards even slight input perturbations often hampers their deployment. Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation. We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/cospgd."
2302.02314,CECT: Controllable Ensemble CNN and Transformer for COVID-19 Image   Classification,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hundreds of million cases and numerous deaths worldwide. Here, we develop a novel classification network CECT by controllable ensemble convolutional neural network and transformer to provide a timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. The CECT is composed of a parallel convolutional encoder block, an aggregate transposed-convolutional decoder block, and a windowed attention classification block. Each block captures features at different scales from 28 $\times$ 28 to 224 $\times$ 224 from the input, composing enriched and comprehensive information. Different from existing methods, our CECT can capture features at both multi-local and global scales without any sophisticated module design. Moreover, the contribution of local features at different scales can be controlled with the proposed ensemble coefficients. We evaluate CECT on two public COVID-19 datasets and it reaches the highest accuracy of 98.1% in the intra-dataset evaluation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the developed CECT achieves an accuracy of 90.9% on the unseen dataset in the inter-dataset evaluation, showing extraordinary generalization ability. With remarkable feature capture ability and generalization ability, we believe CECT can be extended to other medical scenarios as a powerful diagnosis tool. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-Tim/CECT."
2302.02504,Motion-compensated MR CINE reconstruction with reconstruction-driven   motion estimation,"In cardiac CINE, motion-compensated MR reconstruction (MCMR) is an effective approach to address highly undersampled acquisitions by incorporating motion information between frames. In this work, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the MCMR problem and a more integrated and efficient solution to the MCMR field. Contrary to state-of-the-art (SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem as a single entity with one single optimization. Our approach is unique in that the motion estimation is directly driven by the ultimate goal, reconstruction, but not by the canonical motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and target images). We align the objectives of motion estimation and reconstruction, eliminating the drawbacks of artifacts-affected motion estimation and therefore error-propagated reconstruction. Further, we can deliver high-quality reconstruction and realistic motion without applying any regularization/smoothness loss terms, circumventing the non-trivial weighting factor tuning. We evaluate our method on two datasets: 1) an in-house acquired 2D CINE dataset for the retrospective study and 2) the public OCMR cardiac dataset for the prospective study. The conducted experiments indicate that the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x, outperforming SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation across all experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/JZPeterPan/MCMR-Recon-Driven-Motion."
2302.02524,Novel Fundus Image Preprocessing for Retcam Images to Improve Deep   Learning Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity,"Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding eye disorder because of damage to the eye's retina which can affect babies born prematurely. Screening of ROP is essential for early detection and treatment. This is a laborious and manual process which requires trained physician performing dilated ophthalmological examination which can be subjective resulting in lower diagnosis success for clinically significant disease. Automated diagnostic methods can assist ophthalmologists increase diagnosis accuracy using deep learning. Several research groups have highlighted various approaches. Captured ROP Retcam images suffer from poor quality. This paper proposes the use of improved novel fundus preprocessing methods using pretrained transfer learning frameworks to create hybrid models to give higher diagnosis accuracy. Once trained and validated, the evaluations showed that these novel methods in comparison to traditional imaging processing contribute to better and in many aspects higher accuracy in classifying Plus disease, Stages of ROP and Zones in comparison to peer papers."
2302.02535,PaRot: Patch-Wise Rotation-Invariant Network via Feature Disentanglement   and Pose Restoration,"Recent interest in point cloud analysis has led rapid progress in designing deep learning methods for 3D models. However, state-of-the-art models are not robust to rotations, which remains an unknown prior to real applications and harms the model performance. In this work, we introduce a novel Patch-wise Rotation-invariant network (PaRot), which achieves rotation invariance via feature disentanglement and produces consistent predictions for samples with arbitrary rotations. Specifically, we design a siamese training module which disentangles rotation invariance and equivariance from patches defined over different scales, e.g., the local geometry and global shape, via a pair of rotations. However, our disentangled invariant feature loses the intrinsic pose information of each patch. To solve this problem, we propose a rotation-invariant geometric relation to restore the relative pose with equivariant information for patches defined over different scales. Utilising the pose information, we propose a hierarchical module which implements intra-scale and inter-scale feature aggregation for 3D shape learning. Moreover, we introduce a pose-aware feature propagation process with the rotation-invariant relative pose information embedded. Experiments show that our disentanglement module extracts high-quality rotation-robust features and the proposed lightweight model achieves competitive results in rotated 3D object classification and part segmentation tasks. Our project page is released at: https://patchrot.github.io/."
2302.02688,HyperSLICE: HyperBand optimized Spiral for Low-latency Interactive   Cardiac Examination,"PURPOSE: Interactive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used for fast scan planning and MR guided interventions. However, the requirement for real-time acquisition and near real-time visualization constrains the achievable spatio-temporal resolution. This study aims to improve interactive imaging resolution through optimization of undersampled spiral sampling and leveraging of deep learning for low-latency reconstruction (deep artifact suppression). METHODS: A variable density spiral trajectory was parametrized and optimized via HyperBand to provide the best candidate trajectory for rapid deep artifact suppression. Training data consisted of 692 breath-held CINEs. The developed interactive sequence was tested in simulations and prospectively in 13 subjects (10 for image evaluation, 2 during catheterization, 1 during exercise). In the prospective study, the optimized framework -HyperSLICE- was compared to conventional Cartesian real-time, and breath-hold CINE imaging in terms quantitative and qualitative image metrics. Statistical differences were tested using Friedman chi-squared tests with post-hoc Nemenyi test (p<0.05). RESULTS: In simulations the NRMSE, pSNR, SSIM and LAPE were all statistically significantly higher using optimized spiral compared to radial and uniform spiral sampling, particularly after scan plan changes (SSIM: 0.71 vs 0.45 and 0.43). Prospectively, HyperSLICE enabled a higher spatial and temporal resolution than conventional Cartesian real-time imaging. The pipeline was demonstrated in patients during catheter pull back showing sufficiently fast reconstruction for interactive imaging. CONCLUSION: HyperSLICE enables high spatial and temporal resolution interactive imaging. Optimizing the spiral sampling enabled better overall image quality and superior handling of image transitions compared to radial and uniform spiral trajectories."
2302.02809,Listen2Scene: Interactive material-aware binaural sound propagation for   reconstructed 3D scenes,"We present an end-to-end binaural audio rendering approach (Listen2Scene) for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications. We propose a novel neural-network-based binaural sound propagation method to generate acoustic effects for indoor 3D models of real environments. Any clean audio or dry audio can be convolved with the generated acoustic effects to render audio corresponding to the real environment. We propose a graph neural network that uses both the material and the topology information of the 3D scenes and generates a scene latent vector. Moreover, we use a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to generate acoustic effects from the scene latent vector. Our network can handle holes or other artifacts in the reconstructed 3D mesh model. We present an efficient cost function for the generator network to incorporate spatial audio effects. Given the source and the listener position, our learning-based binaural sound propagation approach can generate an acoustic effect in 0.1 milliseconds on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. We have evaluated the accuracy of our approach with binaural acoustic effects generated using an interactive geometric sound propagation algorithm and captured real acoustic effects / real-world recordings. We also performed a perceptual evaluation and observed that the audio rendered by our approach is more plausible than audio rendered using prior learning-based and geometric-based sound propagation algorithms. We quantitatively evaluated the accuracy of our approach using statistical acoustic parameters, and energy decay curves. The demo videos, code and dataset are available online (https://anton-jeran.github.io/Listen2Scene/)."
2302.02887,UVDoc: Neural Grid-based Document Unwarping,"Restoring the original, flat appearance of a printed document from casual photographs of bent and wrinkled pages is a common everyday problem. In this paper we propose a novel method for grid-based single-image document unwarping. Our method performs geometric distortion correction via a fully convolutional deep neural network that learns to predict the 3D grid mesh of the document and the corresponding 2D unwarping grid in a dual-task fashion, implicitly encoding the coupling between the shape of a 3D piece of paper and its 2D image. In order to allow unwarping models to train on data that is more realistic in appearance than the commonly used synthetic Doc3D dataset, we create and publish our own dataset, called UVDoc, which combines pseudo-photorealistic document images with physically accurate 3D shape and unwarping function annotations. Our dataset is labeled with all the information necessary to train our unwarping network, without having to engineer separate loss functions that can deal with the lack of ground-truth typically found in document in the wild datasets. We perform an in-depth evaluation that demonstrates that with the inclusion of our novel pseudo-photorealistic dataset, our relatively small network architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the DocUNet benchmark. We show that the pseudo-photorealistic nature of our UVDoc dataset allows for new and better evaluation methods, such as lighting-corrected MS-SSIM. We provide a novel benchmark dataset that facilitates such evaluations, and propose a metric that quantifies line straightness after unwarping. Our code, results and UVDoc dataset are available at https://github.com/tanguymagne/UVDoc."
2302.03296,Multi-organ segmentation: a progressive exploration of learning   paradigms under scarce annotation,"Precise delineation of multiple organs or abnormal regions in the human body from medical images plays an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis, surgical simulation, image-guided interventions, and especially in radiotherapy treatment planning. Thus, it is of great significance to explore automatic segmentation approaches, among which deep learning-based approaches have evolved rapidly and witnessed remarkable progress in multi-organ segmentation. However, obtaining an appropriately sized and fine-grained annotated dataset of multiple organs is extremely hard and expensive. Such scarce annotation limits the development of high-performance multi-organ segmentation models but promotes many annotation-efficient learning paradigms. Among these, studies on transfer learning leveraging external datasets, semi-supervised learning using unannotated datasets and partially-supervised learning integrating partially-labeled datasets have led the dominant way to break such dilemma in multi-organ segmentation. We first review the traditional fully supervised method, then present a comprehensive and systematic elaboration of the 3 abovementioned learning paradigms in the context of multi-organ segmentation from both technical and methodological perspectives, and finally summarize their challenges and future trends."
2302.03531,Structured Generative Models for Scene Understanding,"This position paper argues for the use of \emph{structured generative models} (SGMs) for the understanding of static scenes. This requires the reconstruction of a 3D scene from an input image (or a set of multi-view images), whereby the contents of the image(s) are causally explained in terms of models of instantiated objects, each with their own type, shape, appearance and pose, along with global variables like scene lighting and camera parameters. This approach also requires scene models which account for the co-occurrences and inter-relationships of objects in a scene. The SGM approach has the merits that it is compositional and generative, which lead to interpretability and editability. \\\\ To pursue the SGM agenda, we need models for objects and scenes, and approaches to carry out inference. We first review models for objects, which include ``things'' (object categories that have a well defined shape), and ``stuff'' (categories which have amorphous spatial extent). We then move on to review \emph{scene models} which describe the inter-relationships of objects. Perhaps the most challenging problem for SGMs is \emph{inference} of the objects, lighting and camera parameters, and scene inter-relationships from input consisting of a single or multiple images. We conclude with a discussion of issues that need addressing to advance the SGM agenda."
2302.03566,Look Around and Learn: Self-Training Object Detection by Exploration,"When an object detector is deployed in a novel setting it often experiences a drop in performance. This paper studies how an embodied agent can automatically fine-tune a pre-existing object detector while exploring and acquiring images in a new environment without relying on human intervention, i.e., a fully self-supervised approach. In our setting, an agent initially learns to explore the environment using a pre-trained off-the-shelf detector to locate objects and associate pseudo-labels. By assuming that pseudo-labels for the same object must be consistent across different views, we learn the exploration policy Look Around to mine hard samples, and we devise a novel mechanism called Disagreement Reconciliation for producing refined pseudo-labels from the consensus among observations. We implement a unified benchmark of the current state-of-the-art and compare our approach with pre-existing exploration policies and perception mechanisms. Our method is shown to outperform existing approaches, improving the object detector by 6.2% in a simulated scenario, a 3.59% advancement over other state-of-the-art methods, and by 9.97% in the real robotic test without relying on ground-truth. Code for the proposed approach and baselines are available at https://iit-pavis.github.io/Look_Around_And_Learn/."
2302.03640,SSR-2D: Semantic 3D Scene Reconstruction from 2D Images,"Most deep learning approaches to comprehensive semantic modeling of 3D indoor spaces require costly dense annotations in the 3D domain. In this work, we explore a central 3D scene modeling task, namely, semantic scene reconstruction without using any 3D annotations. The key idea of our approach is to design a trainable model that employs both incomplete 3D reconstructions and their corresponding source RGB-D images, fusing cross-domain features into volumetric embeddings to predict complete 3D geometry, color, and semantics with only 2D labeling which can be either manual or machine-generated. Our key technical innovation is to leverage differentiable rendering of color and semantics to bridge 2D observations and unknown 3D space, using the observed RGB images and 2D semantics as supervision, respectively. We additionally develop a learning pipeline and corresponding method to enable learning from imperfect predicted 2D labels, which could be additionally acquired by synthesizing in an augmented set of virtual training views complementing the original real captures, enabling more efficient self-supervision loop for semantics. As a result, our end-to-end trainable solution jointly addresses geometry completion, colorization, and semantic mapping from limited RGB-D images, without relying on any 3D ground-truth information. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance of semantic scene completion on two large-scale benchmark datasets MatterPort3D and ScanNet, surpasses baselines even with costly 3D annotations in predicting both geometry and semantics. To our knowledge, our method is also the first 2D-driven method addressing completion and semantic segmentation of real-world 3D scans simultaneously."
2302.03648,Class-Incremental Learning: A Survey,"Deep models, e.g., CNNs and Vision Transformers, have achieved impressive achievements in many vision tasks in the closed world. However, novel classes emerge from time to time in our ever-changing world, requiring a learning system to acquire new knowledge continually. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables the learner to incorporate the knowledge of new classes incrementally and build a universal classifier among all seen classes. Correspondingly, when directly training the model with new class instances, a fatal problem occurs -- the model tends to catastrophically forget the characteristics of former ones, and its performance drastically degrades. There have been numerous efforts to tackle catastrophic forgetting in the machine learning community. In this paper, we survey comprehensively recent advances in class-incremental learning and summarize these methods from several aspects. We also provide a rigorous and unified evaluation of 17 methods in benchmark image classification tasks to find out the characteristics of different algorithms empirically. Furthermore, we notice that the current comparison protocol ignores the influence of memory budget in model storage, which may result in unfair comparison and biased results. Hence, we advocate fair comparison by aligning the memory budget in evaluation, as well as several memory-agnostic performance measures.

2302.03675,Auditing Gender Presentation Differences in Text-to-Image Models,"Text-to-image models, which can generate high-quality images based on textual input, have recently enabled various content-creation tools. Despite significantly affecting a wide range of downstream applications, the distributions of these generated images are still not fully understood, especially when it comes to the potential stereotypical attributes of different genders. In this work, we propose a paradigm (Gender Presentation Differences) that utilizes fine-grained self-presentation attributes to study how gender is presented differently in text-to-image models. By probing gender indicators in the input text (e.g., ""a woman"" or ""a man""), we quantify the frequency differences of presentation-centric attributes (e.g., ""a shirt"" and ""a dress"") through human annotation and introduce a novel metric: GEP. Furthermore, we propose an automatic method to estimate such differences. The automatic GEP metric based on our approach yields a higher correlation with human annotations than that based on existing CLIP scores, consistently across three state-of-the-art text-to-image models. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our metrics in the context of gender stereotypes related to occupations."
2302.03868,A Generalized Surface Loss for Reducing the Hausdorff Distance in   Medical Imaging Segmentation,"Within medical imaging segmentation, the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff-based metrics are standard measures of success for deep learning models. However, modern loss functions for medical image segmentation often only consider the Dice coefficient or similar region-based metrics during training. As a result, segmentation architectures trained over such loss functions run the risk of achieving high accuracy for the Dice coefficient but low accuracy for Hausdorff-based metrics. Low accuracy on Hausdorff-based metrics can be problematic for applications such as tumor segmentation, where such benchmarks are crucial. For example, high Dice scores accompanied by significant Hausdorff errors could indicate that the predictions fail to detect small tumors. We propose the Generalized Surface Loss function, a novel loss function to minimize Hausdorff-based metrics with more desirable numerical properties than current methods and with weighting terms for class imbalance. Our loss function outperforms other losses when tested on the LiTS and BraTS datasets using the state-of-the-art nnUNet architecture. These results suggest we can improve medical imaging segmentation accuracy with our novel loss function."
2302.04032,A Systematic Performance Analysis of Deep Perceptual Loss Networks:   Breaking Transfer Learning Conventions,"In recent years, deep perceptual loss has been widely and successfully used to train machine learning models for many computer vision tasks, including image synthesis, segmentation, and autoencoding. Deep perceptual loss is a type of loss function for images that computes the error between two images as the distance between deep features extracted from a neural network. Most applications of the loss use pretrained networks called loss networks for deep feature extraction. However, despite increasingly widespread use, the effects of loss network implementation on the trained models have not been studied.   This work rectifies this through a systematic evaluation of the effect of different pretrained loss networks on four different application areas. Specifically, the work evaluates 14 different pretrained architectures with four different feature extraction layers. The evaluation reveals that VGG networks without batch normalization have the best performance and that the choice of feature extraction layer is at least as important as the choice of architecture. The analysis also reveals that deep perceptual loss does not adhere to the transfer learning conventions that better ImageNet accuracy implies better downstream performance and that feature extraction from the later layers provides better performance."
2302.04143,Predicting Thrombectomy Recanalization from CT Imaging Using Deep   Learning Models,"For acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusions, clinicians must decide if the benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MTB) outweighs the risks and potential complications following an invasive procedure. Pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) and angiography (CTA) are widely used to characterize occlusions in the brain vasculature. If a patient is deemed eligible, a modified treatment in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) score will be used to grade how well blood flow is reestablished throughout and following the MTB procedure. An estimation of the likelihood of successful recanalization can support treatment decision-making. In this study, we proposed a fully automated prediction of a patient's recanalization score using pre-treatment CT and CTA imaging. We designed a spatial cross attention network (SCANet) that utilizes vision transformers to localize to pertinent slices and brain regions. Our top model achieved an average cross-validated ROC-AUC of 77.33 $\pm$ 3.9\%. This is a promising result that supports future applications of deep learning on CT and CTA for the identification of eligible AIS patients for MTB."
2302.04341,Neonatal Face and Facial Landmark Detection from Video Recordings,"This paper explores automated face and facial landmark detection of neonates, which is an important first step in many video-based neonatal health applications, such as vital sign estimation, pain assessment, sleep-wake classification, and jaundice detection. Utilising three publicly available datasets of neonates in the clinical environment, 366 images (258 subjects) and 89 (66 subjects) were annotated for training and testing, respectively. Transfer learning was applied to two YOLO-based models, with input training images augmented with random horizontal flipping, photo-metric colour distortion, translation and scaling during each training epoch. Additionally, the re-orientation of input images and fusion of trained deep learning models was explored. Our proposed model based on YOLOv7Face outperformed existing methods with a mean average precision of 84.8% for face detection, and a normalised mean error of 0.072 for facial landmark detection. Overall, this will assist in the development of fully automated neonatal health assessment algorithms."
2302.04419,An Investigation into Pre-Training Object-Centric Representations for   Reinforcement Learning,"Unsupervised object-centric representation (OCR) learning has recently drawn attention as a new paradigm of visual representation. This is because of its potential of being an effective pre-training technique for various downstream tasks in terms of sample efficiency, systematic generalization, and reasoning. Although image-based reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most important and thus frequently mentioned such downstream tasks, the benefit in RL has surprisingly not been investigated systematically thus far. Instead, most of the evaluations have focused on rather indirect metrics such as segmentation quality and object property prediction accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of OCR pre-training for image-based reinforcement learning via empirical experiments. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a simple object-centric visual RL benchmark and conduct experiments to answer questions such as ``Does OCR pre-training improve performance on object-centric tasks?'' and ``Can OCR pre-training help with out-of-distribution generalization?''. Our results provide empirical evidence for valuable insights into the effectiveness of OCR pre-training for RL and the potential limitations of its use in certain scenarios. Additionally, this study also examines the critical aspects of incorporating OCR pre-training in RL, including performance in a visually complex environment and the appropriate pooling layer to aggregate the object representations."
2302.04440,Feature Likelihood Divergence: Evaluating the Generalization of   Generative Models Using Samples,"The past few years have seen impressive progress in the development of deep generative models capable of producing high-dimensional, complex, and photo-realistic data. However, current methods for evaluating such models remain incomplete: standard likelihood-based metrics do not always apply and rarely correlate with perceptual fidelity, while sample-based metrics, such as FID, are insensitive to overfitting, i.e., inability to generalize beyond the training set. To address these limitations, we propose a new metric called the Feature Likelihood Divergence (FLD), a parametric sample-based metric that uses density estimation to provide a comprehensive trichotomic evaluation accounting for novelty (i.e., different from the training samples), fidelity, and diversity of generated samples. We empirically demonstrate the ability of FLD to identify overfitting problem cases, even when previously proposed metrics fail. We also extensively evaluate FLD on various image datasets and model classes, demonstrating its ability to match intuitions of previous metrics like FID while offering a more comprehensive evaluation of generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/marcojira/fld."
2302.04607,Deep Intra-Image Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised One-Step   Person Search,"Weakly supervised person search aims to perform joint pedestrian detection and re-identification (re-id) with only person bounding-box annotations. Recently, the idea of contrastive learning is initially applied to weakly supervised person search, where two common contrast strategies are memory-based contrast and intra-image contrast. We argue that current intra-image contrast is shallow, which suffers from spatial-level and occlusion-level variance. In this paper, we present a novel deep intra-image contrastive learning using a Siamese network. Two key modules are spatial-invariant contrast (SIC) and occlusion-invariant contrast (OIC). SIC performs many-to-one contrasts between two branches of Siamese network and dense prediction contrasts in one branch of Siamese network. With these many-to-one and dense contrasts, SIC tends to learn discriminative scale-invariant and location-invariant features to solve spatial-level variance. OIC enhances feature consistency with the masking strategy to learn occlusion-invariant features. Extensive experiments are performed on two person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW, respectively. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised one-step person search approaches. We hope that our simple intra-image contrastive learning can provide more paradigms on weakly supervised person search. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/jiabeiwangTJU/DICL}."
2302.04676,Stacked Cross-modal Feature Consolidation Attention Networks for Image   Captioning,"Recently, the attention-enriched encoder-decoder framework has aroused great interest in image captioning due to its overwhelming progress. Many visual attention models directly leverage meaningful regions to generate image descriptions. However, seeking a direct transition from visual space to text is not enough to generate fine-grained captions. This paper exploits a feature-compounding approach to bring together high-level semantic concepts and visual information regarding the contextual environment fully end-to-end. Thus, we propose a stacked cross-modal feature consolidation (SCFC) attention network for image captioning in which we simultaneously consolidate cross-modal features through a novel compounding function in a multi-step reasoning fashion. Besides, we jointly employ spatial information and context-aware attributes (CAA) as the principal components in our proposed compounding function, where our CAA provides a concise context-sensitive semantic representation. To make better use of consolidated features potential, we further propose an SCFC-LSTM as the caption generator, which can leverage discriminative semantic information through the caption generation process. The experimental results indicate that our proposed SCFC can outperform various state-of-the-art image captioning benchmarks in terms of popular metrics on the MSCOCO and Flickr30K datasets."
2302.04850,Robot Synesthesia: A Sound and Emotion Guided AI Painter,"If a picture paints a thousand words, sound may voice a million. While recent robotic painting and image synthesis methods have achieved progress in generating visuals from text inputs, the translation of sound into images is vastly unexplored. Generally, sound-based interfaces and sonic interactions have the potential to expand accessibility and control for the user and provide a means to convey complex emotions and the dynamic aspects of the real world. In this paper, we propose an approach for using sound and speech to guide a robotic painting process, known here as robot synesthesia. For general sound, we encode the simulated paintings and input sounds into the same latent space. For speech, we decouple speech into its transcribed text and the tone of the speech. Whereas we use the text to control the content, we estimate the emotions from the tone to guide the mood of the painting. Our approach has been fully integrated with FRIDA, a robotic painting framework, adding sound and speech to FRIDA's existing input modalities, such as text and style. In two surveys, participants were able to correctly guess the emotion or natural sound used to generate a given painting more than twice as likely as random chance. On our sound-guided image manipulation and music-guided paintings, we discuss the results qualitatively."
2302.04865,ELBA: Learning by Asking for Embodied Visual Navigation and Task   Completion,"The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Although there have been significant advancements in related vision-language benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in embodied environments. To address this gap, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate ELBA on the TEACh vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improved task performance compared to baseline models without question-answering capabilities."
2302.04871,In-N-Out: Faithful 3D GAN Inversion with Volumetric Decomposition for   Face Editing,"3D-aware GANs offer new capabilities for view synthesis while preserving the editing functionalities of their 2D counterparts. GAN inversion is a crucial step that seeks the latent code to reconstruct input images or videos, subsequently enabling diverse editing tasks through manipulation of this latent code. However, a model pre-trained on a particular dataset (e.g., FFHQ) often has difficulty reconstructing images with out-of-distribution (OOD) objects such as faces with heavy make-up or occluding objects. We address this issue by explicitly modeling OOD objects from the input in 3D-aware GANs. Our core idea is to represent the image using two individual neural radiance fields: one for the in-distribution content and the other for the out-of-distribution object. The final reconstruction is achieved by optimizing the composition of these two radiance fields with carefully designed regularization. We demonstrate that our explicit decomposition alleviates the inherent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editability. We evaluate reconstruction accuracy and editability of our method on challenging real face images and videos and showcase favorable results against other baselines."
2302.05041,Data-Driven Stochastic Motion Evaluation and Optimization with Image by   Spatially-Aligned Temporal Encoding,"This paper proposes a probabilistic motion prediction method for long motions. The motion is predicted so that it accomplishes a task from the initial state observed in the given image. While our method evaluates the task achievability by the Energy-Based Model (EBM), previous EBMs are not designed for evaluating the consistency between different domains (i.e., image and motion in our method). Our method seamlessly integrates the image and motion data into the image feature domain by spatially-aligned temporal encoding so that features are extracted along the motion trajectory projected onto the image. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a data-driven motion optimization method, Deep Motion Optimizer (DMO), that works with EBM for motion prediction. Different from previous gradient-based optimizers, our self-supervised DMO alleviates the difficulty of hyper-parameter tuning to avoid local minima. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a variety of experiments with similar SOTA methods."
2302.05043,A Review of Predictive and Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for   Medical Images,"Over the last decade, supervised deep learning on manually annotated big data has been progressing significantly on computer vision tasks. But the application of deep learning in medical image analysis was limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotated medical imaging data. An emerging solution is self-supervised learning (SSL), among which contrastive SSL is the most successful approach to rivalling or outperforming supervised learning. This review investigates several state-of-the-art contrastive SSL algorithms originally on natural images as well as their adaptations for medical images, and concludes by discussing recent advances, current limitations, and future directions in applying contrastive SSL in the medical domain."
2302.05087,Generalized Video Anomaly Event Detection: Systematic Taxonomy and   Comparison of Deep Models,"Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) serves as a pivotal technology in the intelligent surveillance systems, enabling the temporal or spatial identification of anomalous events within videos. While existing reviews predominantly concentrate on conventional unsupervised methods, they often overlook the emergence of weakly-supervised and fully-unsupervised approaches. To address this gap, this survey extends the conventional scope of VAD beyond unsupervised methods, encompassing a broader spectrum termed Generalized Video Anomaly Event Detection (GVAED). By skillfully incorporating recent advancements rooted in diverse assumptions and learning frameworks, this survey introduces an intuitive taxonomy that seamlessly navigates through unsupervised, weakly-supervised, supervised and fully-unsupervised VAD methodologies, elucidating the distinctions and interconnections within these research trajectories. In addition, this survey facilitates prospective researchers by assembling a compilation of research resources, including public datasets, available codebases, programming tools, and pertinent literature. Furthermore, this survey quantitatively assesses model performance, delves into research challenges and directions, and outlines potential avenues for future exploration."
2302.05109,Adjacent-Level Feature Cross-Fusion With 3-D CNN for Remote Sensing   Image Change Detection,"Deep learning-based change detection (CD) using remote sensing images has received increasing attention in recent years. However, how to effectively extract and fuse the deep features of bi-temporal images for improving the accuracy of CD is still a challenge. To address that, a novel adjacent-level feature fusion network with 3D convolution (named AFCF3D-Net) is proposed in this article. First, through the inner fusion property of 3D convolution, we design a new feature fusion way that can simultaneously extract and fuse the feature information from bi-temporal images. Then, to alleviate the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level features, we propose an adjacent-level feature cross-fusion (AFCF) module to aggregate complementary feature information between the adjacent levels. Furthermore, the full-scale skip connection strategy is introduced to improve the capability of pixel-wise prediction and the compactness of changed objects in the results. Finally, the proposed AFCF3D-Net has been validated on the three challenging remote sensing CD datasets: the Wuhan building dataset (WHU-CD), the LEVIR building dataset (LEVIR-CD), and the Sun Yat-Sen University dataset (SYSU-CD). The results of quantitative analysis and qualitative comparison demonstrate that the proposed AFCF3D-Net achieves better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/wm-Githuber/AFCF3D-Net."
2302.05119,Fast Learnings of Coupled Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition Using Optimal   Gradient and Low-rank Approximation,"Tensor decomposition is a fundamental technique widely applied in signal processing, machine learning, and various other fields. However, traditional tensor decomposition methods encounter limitations when jointly analyzing multi-block tensors, as they often struggle to effectively explore shared information among tensors. In this study, we first introduce a novel coupled nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition algorithm optimized by the alternating proximal gradient method (CoNCPD-APG). This algorithm is specially designed to address the challenges of jointly decomposing different tensors that are partially or fully linked, while simultaneously extracting common components, individual components and, core tensors. Recognizing the computational challenges inherent in optimizing nonnegative constraints over high-dimensional tensor data, we further propose the lraCoNCPD-APG algorithm. By integrating low-rank approximation with the proposed CoNCPD-APG method, the proposed algorithm can significantly decrease the computational burden without compromising decomposition quality, particularly for multi-block large-scale tensors. Simulation experiments conducted on synthetic data, real-world face image data, and two kinds of electroencephalography (EEG) data demonstrate the practicality and superiority of the proposed algorithms for coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition problems. Our results underscore the efficacy of our methods in uncovering meaningful patterns and structures from complex multi-block tensor data, thereby offering valuable insights for future applications."
2302.05154,Industrial and Medical Anomaly Detection Through Cycle-Consistent   Adversarial Networks,"In this study, a new Anomaly Detection (AD) approach for industrial and medical images is proposed. This method leverages the theoretical strengths of unsupervised learning and the data availability of both normal and abnormal classes. Indeed, the AD is often formulated as an unsupervised task, implying only normal images during training. These normal images are devoted to be reconstructed, through an autoencoder architecture for instance. However, the information contained in abnormal data, when available, is also valuable for this reconstruction. The model would be able to identify its weaknesses by better learning how to transform an abnormal (respectively normal) image into a normal (respectively abnormal) one, helping the entire model to learn better than a single normal to normal reconstruction. To address this challenge, the proposed method uses Cycle-Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GAN) for (ab)normal-to-normal translation. After an input image has been reconstructed by the normal generator, an anomaly score quantifies the differences between the input and its reconstruction. Based on a threshold set to satisfy a business quality constraint, the input image is then flagged as normal or not. The proposed method is evaluated on industrial and medical datasets. The results demonstrate accurate performance with a zero false negative constraint compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ValDelch/CycleGANS-AnomalyDetection."
2302.05262,Evaluation of Data Augmentation and Loss Functions in Semantic Image   Segmentation for Drilling Tool Wear Detection,"Tool wear monitoring is crucial for quality control and cost reduction in manufacturing processes, of which drilling applications are one example. In this paper, we present a U-Net based semantic image segmentation pipeline, deployed on microscopy images of cutting inserts, for the purpose of wear detection. The wear area is differentiated in two different types, resulting in a multiclass classification problem. Joining the two wear types in one general wear class, on the other hand, allows the problem to be formulated as a binary classification task. Apart from the comparison of the binary and multiclass problem, also different loss functions, i. e., Cross Entropy, Focal Cross Entropy, and a loss based on the Intersection over Union (IoU), are investigated. Furthermore, models are trained on image tiles of different sizes, and augmentation techniques of varying intensities are deployed. We find, that the best performing models are binary models, trained on data with moderate augmentation and an IoU-based loss function."
2302.05309,"The LuViRA Dataset: Synchronized Vision, Radio, and Audio Sensors for   Indoor Localization","We present a synchronized multisensory dataset for accurate and robust indoor localization: the Lund University Vision, Radio, and Audio (LuViRA) Dataset. The dataset includes color images, corresponding depth maps, inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings, channel response between a 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) testbed and user equipment, audio recorded by 12 microphones, and accurate six degrees of freedom (6DOF) pose ground truth of 0.5 mm. We synchronize these sensors to ensure that all data is recorded simultaneously. A camera, speaker, and transmit antenna are placed on top of a slowly moving service robot, and 89 trajectories are recorded. Each trajectory includes 20 to 50 seconds of recorded sensor data and ground truth labels. Data from different sensors can be used separately or jointly to perform localization tasks, and data from the motion capture (mocap) system is used to verify the results obtained by the localization algorithms. The main aim of this dataset is to enable research on sensor fusion with the most commonly used sensors for localization tasks. Moreover, the full dataset or some parts of it can also be used for other research areas such as channel estimation, image classification, etc. Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/ilaydayaman/LuViRA_Dataset"
2302.05435,A deep convolutional neural network for salt-and-pepper noise removal   using selective convolutional blocks,"In recent years, there has been an unprecedented upsurge in applying deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to solve image denoising problems, owing to their superior performance. However, CNNs mostly rely on Gaussian noise, and there is a conspicuous lack of exploiting CNNs for salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise reduction. In this paper, we proposed a deep CNN model, namely SeConvNet, to suppress SAP noise in gray-scale and color images. To meet this objective, we introduce a new selective convolutional (SeConv) block. SeConvNet is compared to state-of-the-art SAP denoising methods using extensive experiments on various common datasets. The results illustrate that the proposed SeConvNet model effectively restores images corrupted by SAP noise and surpasses all its counterparts at both quantitative criteria and visual effects, especially at high and very high noise densities."
2302.05666,Jaccard Metric Losses: Optimizing the Jaccard Index with Soft Labels,"Intersection over Union (IoU) losses are surrogates that directly optimize the Jaccard index. Leveraging IoU losses as part of the loss function have demonstrated superior performance in semantic segmentation tasks compared to optimizing pixel-wise losses such as the cross-entropy loss alone. However, we identify a lack of flexibility in these losses to support vital training techniques like label smoothing, knowledge distillation, and semi-supervised learning, mainly due to their inability to process soft labels. To address this, we introduce Jaccard Metric Losses (JMLs), which are identical to the soft Jaccard loss in standard settings with hard labels but are fully compatible with soft labels. We apply JMLs to three prominent use cases of soft labels: label smoothing, knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning, and demonstrate their potential to enhance model accuracy and calibration. Our experiments show consistent improvements over the cross-entropy loss across 4 semantic segmentation datasets (Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K, DeepGlobe Land) and 13 architectures, including classic CNNs and recent vision transformers. Remarkably, our straightforward approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning methods. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/zifuwanggg/JDTLosses}{https://github.com/zifuwanggg/JDTLosses}."
2302.05803,TPE-Net: Track Point Extraction and Association Network for Rail Path   Proposal Generation,"One essential feature of an autonomous train is minimizing collision risks with third-party objects. To estimate the risk, the control system must identify topological information of all the rail routes ahead on which the train can possibly move, especially within merging or diverging rails. This way, the train can figure out the status of potential obstacles with respect to its route and hence, make a timely decision. Numerous studies have successfully extracted all rail tracks as a whole within forward-looking images without considering element instances. Still, some image-based methods have employed hard-coded prior knowledge of railway geometry on 3D data to associate left-right rails and generate rail route instances. However, we propose a rail path extraction pipeline in which left-right rail pixels of each rail route instance are extracted and associated through a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture called TPE-Net. Two different regression branches for TPE-Net are proposed to regress the locations of center points of each rail route, along with their corresponding left-right pixels. Extracted rail pixels are then spatially clustered to generate topological information of all the possible train routes (ego-paths), discarding non-ego-path ones. Experimental results on a challenging, publicly released benchmark show true-positive-pixel level average precision and recall of 0.9207 and 0.8721, respectively, at about 12 frames per second. Even though our evaluation results are not higher than the SOTA, the proposed regression pipeline performs remarkably in extracting the correspondences by looking once at the image. It generates strong rail route hypotheses without reliance on camera parameters, 3D data, and geometrical constraints."
2302.05844,Graph Matching Optimization Network for Point Cloud Registration,"Point Cloud Registration is a fundamental and challenging problem in 3D computer vision. Recent works often utilize the geometric structure information in point feature embedding or outlier rejection for registration while neglecting to consider explicitly isometry-preserving constraint ($e.g.,$ point pair linked edge's length preserving after transformation) in training. We claim that the explicit isometry-preserving constraint is also important for improving feature representation abilities in the feature training stage. To this end, we propose a \underline{G}raph \underline{M}atching \underline{O}ptimization based \underline{Net}work (GMONet for short), which utilizes the graph-matching optimizer to explicitly exert the isometry preserving constraints in the point feature training to improve the point feature representation. Specifically, we exploit a partial graph-matching optimizer to optimize the super point ($i.e.,$ down-sampled key points) features and a full graph-matching optimizer to optimize fine-level point features in the overlap region. Meanwhile, we leverage the inexact proximal point method and the mini-batch sampling technique to accelerate these two graph-matching optimizers. Given high discriminative point features in the evaluation stage, we utilize the RANSAC approach to estimate the transformation between the scanned pairs. The proposed method has been evaluated on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch benchmarks and the KITTI benchmark. The experimental results show that our method performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art baselines."
2302.05846,OAMatcher: An Overlapping Areas-based Network for Accurate Local Feature   Matching,"Local feature matching is an essential component in many visual applications. In this work, we propose OAMatcher, a Tranformer-based detector-free method that imitates humans behavior to generate dense and accurate matches. Firstly, OAMatcher predicts overlapping areas to promote effective and clean global context aggregation, with the key insight that humans focus on the overlapping areas instead of the entire images after multiple observations when matching keypoints in image pairs. Technically, we first perform global information integration across all keypoints to imitate the humans behavior of observing the entire images at the beginning of feature matching. Then, we propose Overlapping Areas Prediction Module (OAPM) to capture the keypoints in co-visible regions and conduct feature enhancement among them to simulate that humans transit the focus regions from the entire images to overlapping regions, hence realizeing effective information exchange without the interference coming from the keypoints in non overlapping areas. Besides, since humans tend to leverage probability to determine whether the match labels are correct or not, we propose a Match Labels Weight Strategy (MLWS) to generate the coefficients used to appraise the reliability of the ground-truth match labels, while alleviating the influence of measurement noise coming from the data. Moreover, we integrate depth-wise convolution into Tranformer encoder layers to ensure OAMatcher extracts local and global feature representation concurrently. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OAMatcher outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, while exhibiting excellent robustness to extreme appearance variants. The source code is available at https://github.com/DK-HU/OAMatcher."
2302.05881,A generalizable framework for low-rank tensor completion with numerical   priors,"Low-Rank Tensor Completion, a method which exploits the inherent structure of tensors, has been studied extensively as an effective approach to tensor completion. Whilst such methods attained great success, none have systematically considered exploiting the numerical priors of tensor elements. Ignoring numerical priors causes loss of important information regarding the data, and therefore prevents the algorithms from reaching optimal accuracy. Despite the existence of some individual works which consider ad hoc numerical priors for specific tasks, no generalizable frameworks for incorporating numerical priors have appeared. We present the Generalized CP Decomposition Tensor Completion (GCDTC) framework, the first generalizable framework for low-rank tensor completion that takes numerical priors of the data into account. We test GCDTC by further proposing the Smooth Poisson Tensor Completion (SPTC) algorithm, an instantiation of the GCDTC framework, whose performance exceeds current state-of-the-arts by considerable margins in the task of non-negative tensor completion, exemplifying GCDTC's effectiveness. Our code is open-source."
2302.05923,Uncertainty-Aware AB3DMOT by Variational 3D Object Detection,"Autonomous driving needs to rely on high-quality 3D object detection to ensure safe navigation in the world. Uncertainty estimation is an effective tool to provide statistically accurate predictions, while the associated detection uncertainty can be used to implement a more safe navigation protocol or include the user in the loop. In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural Network-based TANet 3D object detector to generate 3D object detections with uncertainty and introduce these detections to an uncertainty-aware AB3DMOT tracker. This is done by applying a linear transformation to the estimated uncertainty matrix, which is subsequently used as a measurement noise for the adopted Kalman filter. We implement two ways to estimate output uncertainty, i.e., internally, by computing the variance of the CNN outputs and then propagating the uncertainty through the post-processing, and externally, by associating the final predictions of different samples and computing the covariance of each predicted box. In experiments, we show that the external uncertainty estimation leads to better results, outperforming both internal uncertainty estimation and classical tracking approaches. Furthermore, we propose a method to initialize the Variational 3D object detector with a pretrained TANet model, which leads to the best performing models."
2302.06072,Actional Atomic-Concept Learning for Demystifying Vision-Language   Navigation,"Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task which requires an agent to align complex visual observations to language instructions to reach the goal position. Most existing VLN agents directly learn to align the raw directional features and visual features trained using one-hot labels to linguistic instruction features. However, the big semantic gap among these multi-modal inputs makes the alignment difficult and therefore limits the navigation performance. In this paper, we propose Actional Atomic-Concept Learning (AACL), which maps visual observations to actional atomic concepts for facilitating the alignment. Specifically, an actional atomic concept is a natural language phrase containing an atomic action and an object, e.g., ``go up stairs''. These actional atomic concepts, which serve as the bridge between observations and instructions, can effectively mitigate the semantic gap and simplify the alignment. AACL contains three core components: 1) a concept mapping module to map the observations to the actional atomic concept representations through the VLN environment and the recently proposed Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, 2) a concept refining adapter to encourage more instruction-oriented object concept extraction by re-ranking the predicted object concepts by CLIP, and 3) an observation co-embedding module which utilizes concept representations to regularize the observation representations. Our AACL establishes new state-of-the-art results on both fine-grained (R2R) and high-level (REVERIE and R2R-Last) VLN benchmarks. Moreover, the visualization shows that AACL significantly improves the interpretability in action decision."
2302.06089,Federated attention consistent learning models for prostate cancer   diagnosis and Gleason grading,"Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise in transforming medical imaging, enhancing diagnostics, and refining treatment strategies. However, the reliance on extensive multicenter datasets for training AI models poses challenges due to privacy concerns. Federated learning provides a solution by facilitating collaborative model training across multiple centers without sharing raw data. This study introduces a federated attention-consistent learning (FACL) framework to address challenges associated with large-scale pathological images and data heterogeneity. FACL enhances model generalization by maximizing attention consistency between local clients and the server model. To ensure privacy and validate robustness, we incorporated differential privacy by introducing noise during parameter transfer. We assessed the effectiveness of FACL in cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading tasks using 19,461 whole-slide images of prostate cancer from multiple centers. In the diagnosis task, FACL achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9718, outperforming seven centers with an average AUC of 0.9499 when categories are relatively balanced. For the Gleason grading task, FACL attained a Kappa score of 0.8463, surpassing the average Kappa score of 0.7379 from six centers. In conclusion, FACL offers a robust, accurate, and cost-effective AI training model for prostate cancer pathology while maintaining effective data safeguards."
2302.06279,Sneaky Spikes: Uncovering Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Spiking Neural   Networks with Neuromorphic Data,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, including image and speech recognition. However, maximizing the effectiveness of DNNs requires meticulous optimization of numerous hyperparameters and network parameters through training. Moreover, high-performance DNNs entail many parameters, which consume significant energy during training. In order to overcome these challenges, researchers have turned to spiking neural networks (SNNs), which offer enhanced energy efficiency and biologically plausible data processing capabilities, rendering them highly suitable for sensory data tasks, particularly in neuromorphic data. Despite their advantages, SNNs, like DNNs, are susceptible to various threats, including adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. Yet, the field of SNNs still needs to be explored in terms of understanding and countering these attacks.   This paper delves into backdoor attacks in SNNs using neuromorphic datasets and diverse triggers. Specifically, we explore backdoor triggers within neuromorphic data that can manipulate their position and color, providing a broader scope of possibilities than conventional triggers in domains like images. We present various attack strategies, achieving an attack success rate of up to 100% while maintaining a negligible impact on clean accuracy. Furthermore, we assess these attacks' stealthiness, revealing that our most potent attacks possess significant stealth capabilities. Lastly, we adapt several state-of-the-art defenses from the image domain, evaluating their efficacy on neuromorphic data and uncovering instances where they fall short, leading to compromised performance."
2302.06287,Render-and-Compare: Cross-View 6 DoF Localization from Noisy Prior,"Despite the significant progress in 6-DoF visual localization, researchers are mostly driven by ground-level benchmarks. Compared with aerial oblique photography, ground-level map collection lacks scalability and complete coverage. In this work, we propose to go beyond the traditional ground-level setting and exploit the cross-view localization from aerial to ground. We solve this problem by formulating camera pose estimation as an iterative render-and-compare pipeline and enhancing the robustness through augmenting seeds from noisy initial priors. As no public dataset exists for the studied problem, we collect a new dataset that provides a variety of cross-view images from smartphones and drones and develop a semi-automatic system to acquire ground-truth poses for query images. We benchmark our method as well as several state-of-the-art baselines and demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches by a large margin."
2302.06308,Fine-tuning Is a Surprisingly Effective Domain Adaptation Baseline in   Handwriting Recognition,"In many machine learning tasks, a large general dataset and a small specialized dataset are available. In such situations, various domain adaptation methods can be used to adapt a general model to the target dataset. We show that in the case of neural networks trained for handwriting recognition using CTC, simple fine-tuning with data augmentation works surprisingly well in such scenarios and that it is resistant to overfitting even for very small target domain datasets. We evaluated the behavior of fine-tuning with respect to augmentation, training data size, and quality of the pre-trained network, both in writer-dependent and writer-independent settings. On a large real-world dataset, fine-tuning on new writers provided an average relative CER improvement of 25 % for 16 text lines and 50 % for 256 text lines."
2302.06318,Towards Writing Style Adaptation in Handwriting Recognition,"One of the challenges of handwriting recognition is to transcribe a large number of vastly different writing styles. State-of-the-art approaches do not explicitly use information about the writer's style, which may be limiting overall accuracy due to various ambiguities. We explore models with writer-dependent parameters which take the writer's identity as an additional input. The proposed models can be trained on datasets with partitions likely written by a single author (e.g. single letter, diary, or chronicle). We propose a Writer Style Block (WSB), an adaptive instance normalization layer conditioned on learned embeddings of the partitions. We experimented with various placements and settings of WSB and contrastively pre-trained embeddings. We show that our approach outperforms a baseline with no WSB in a writer-dependent scenario and that it is possible to estimate embeddings for new writers. However, domain adaptation using simple fine-tuning in a writer-independent setting provides superior accuracy at a similar computational cost. The proposed approach should be further investigated in terms of training stability and embedding regularization to overcome such a baseline."
2302.06352,"Deep Anatomical Federated Network (Dafne): An open client-server   framework for the continuous, collaborative improvement of deep   learning-based medical image segmentation","Purpose: To present and evaluate Dafne (deep anatomical federated network), a freely available decentralized, collaborative deep learning system for the semantic segmentation of radiological images through federated incremental learning. Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability. Conclusion: Dafne showed improvement in segmentation quality over time, demonstrating potential for learning and generalization."
2302.06358,Anticipating Next Active Objects for Egocentric Videos,"This paper addresses the problem of anticipating the next-active-object location in the future, for a given egocentric video clip where the contact might happen, before any action takes place. The problem is considerably hard, as we aim at estimating the position of such objects in a scenario where the observed clip and the action segment are separated by the so-called ``time to contact'' (TTC) segment. Many methods have been proposed to anticipate the action of a person based on previous hand movements and interactions with the surroundings. However, there have been no attempts to investigate the next possible interactable object, and its future location with respect to the first-person's motion and the field-of-view drift during the TTC window. We define this as the task of Anticipating the Next ACTive Object (ANACTO). To this end, we propose a transformer-based self-attention framework to identify and locate the next-active-object in an egocentric clip.   We benchmark our method on three datasets: EpicKitchens-100, EGTEA+ and Ego4D. We also provide annotations for the first two datasets. Our approach performs best compared to relevant baseline methods. We also conduct ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of the proposed and baseline methods on varying conditions. Code and ANACTO task annotations will be made available upon paper acceptance."
2302.06432,A Deep Learning-based Global and Segmentation-based Semantic Feature   Fusion Approach for Indoor Scene Classification,"This work proposes a novel approach that uses a semantic segmentation mask to obtain a 2D spatial layout of the segmentation-categories across the scene, designated by segmentation-based semantic features (SSFs). These features represent, per segmentation-category, the pixel count, as well as the 2D average position and respective standard deviation values. Moreover, a two-branch network, GS2F2App, that exploits CNN-based global features extracted from RGB images and the segmentation-based features extracted from the proposed SSFs, is also proposed. GS2F2App was evaluated in two indoor scene benchmark datasets: the SUN RGB-D and the NYU Depth V2, achieving state-of-the-art results on both datasets."
2302.06441,ContrasInver: Ultra-Sparse Label Semi-supervised Regression for   Multi-dimensional Seismic Inversion,"The automated interpretation and inversion of seismic data have advanced significantly with the development of Deep Learning (DL) methods. However, these methods often require numerous costly well logs, limiting their application only to mature or synthetic data. This paper presents ContrasInver, a method that achieves seismic inversion using as few as two or three well logs, significantly reducing current requirements. In ContrasInver, we propose three key innovations to address the challenges of applying semi-supervised learning to regression tasks with ultra-sparse labels. The Multi-dimensional Sample Generation (MSG) technique pioneers a paradigm for sample generation in multi-dimensional inversion. It produces a large number of diverse samples from a single well, while establishing lateral continuity in seismic data. MSG yields substantial improvements over current techniques, even without the use of semi-supervised learning. The Region-Growing Training (RGT) strategy leverages the inherent continuity of seismic data, effectively propagating accuracy from closer to more distant regions based on the proximity of well logs. The Impedance Vectorization Projection (IVP) vectorizes impedance values and performs semi-supervised learning in a compressed space. We demonstrated that the Jacobian matrix derived from this space can filter out some outlier components in pseudo-label vectors, thereby solving the value confusion issue in semi-supervised regression learning. In the experiments, ContrasInver achieved state-of-the-art performance in the synthetic data SEAM I. In the field data with two or three well logs, only the methods based on the components proposed in this paper were able to achieve reasonable results. It's the first data-driven approach yielding reliable results on the Netherlands F3 and Delft, using only three and two well logs respectively."
2302.06504,Preconditioned Score-based Generative Models,"Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models. However, a fundamental limitation is that their sampling process is slow due to a need for many (e.g., 2000) iterations of sequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the sampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We assault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and reverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a novel preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output distribution of the SGM, with no risk of inducing systematical bias to the original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations, easing the parameter estimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various image datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our PDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the synthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to 28x on more challenging high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation. Compared with the latest generative models (e.g., CLD-SGM and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the best sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at an FID score of 1.99. Our code is publicly available to foster any further research https://github.com/fudan-zvg/PDS."
2302.06555,Do Vision and Language Models Share Concepts? A Vector Space Alignment   Study,"Large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) are said to ``lack the ability to connect utterances to the world'' (Bender and Koller, 2020), because they do not have ``mental models of the world' '(Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023). If so, one would expect LM representations to be unrelated to representations induced by vision models. We present an empirical evaluation across four families of LMs (BERT, GPT-2, OPT and LLaMA-2) and three vision model architectures (ResNet, SegFormer, and MAE). Our experiments show that LMs partially converge towards representations isomorphic to those of vision models, subject to dispersion, polysemy and frequency. This has important implications for both multi-modal processing and the LM understanding debate (Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023)."
2302.06564,A Domain Decomposition-Based CNN-DNN Architecture for Model Parallel   Training Applied to Image Recognition Problems,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) and, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances in a wide range of modern computer application problems. However, the increasing availability of large amounts of datasets as well as the increasing available computational power of modern computers lead to a steady growth in the complexity and size of DNN and CNN models, respectively, and thus, to longer training times. Hence, various methods and attempts have been developed to accelerate and parallelize the training of complex network architectures. In this work, a novel CNN-DNN architecture is proposed that naturally supports a model parallel training strategy and that is loosely inspired by two-level domain decomposition methods (DDM). First, local CNN models, that is, subnetworks, are defined that operate on overlapping or nonoverlapping parts of the input data, for example, sub-images. The subnetworks can be trained completely in parallel and independently of each other. Each subnetwork then outputs a local decision for the given machine learning problem which is exclusively based on the respective local input data. Subsequently, in a second step, an additional DNN model is trained which evaluates the local decisions of the local subnetworks and generates a final, global decision. In this paper, we apply the proposed architecture to image classification problems using CNNs. Experimental results for different 2D image classification problems are provided as well as a face recognition problem, and a classification problem for 3D computer tomography (CT) scans. Therefore, classical ResNet and VGG architectures are considered. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly accelerate the required training time compared to the global model and, additionally, can also help to improve the accuracy of the underlying classification problem."
2302.06727,Deep Learning Predicts Prevalent and Incident Parkinson's Disease From   UK Biobank Fundus Imaging,"Parkinson's disease is the world's fastest-growing neurological disorder. Research to elucidate the mechanisms of Parkinson's disease and automate diagnostics would greatly improve the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. Current diagnostic methods are expensive and have limited availability. Considering the insidious and preclinical onset and progression of the disease, a desirable screening should be diagnostically accurate even before the onset of symptoms to allow medical interventions. We highlight retinal fundus imaging, often termed a window to the brain, as a diagnostic screening modality for Parkinson's disease. We conducted a systematic evaluation of conventional machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify Parkinson's disease from UK Biobank fundus imaging. Our results show that Parkinson's disease individuals can be differentiated from age and gender-matched healthy subjects with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.77. This accuracy is maintained when predicting either prevalent or incident Parkinson's disease. Explainability and trustworthiness are enhanced by visual attribution maps of localized biomarkers and quantified metrics of model robustness to data perturbations."
2302.06815,Self-Supervised Likelihood Estimation with Energy Guidance for Anomaly   Segmentation in Urban Scenes,"Robust autonomous driving requires agents to accurately identify unexpected areas (anomalies) in urban scenes. To this end, some critical issues remain open: how to design advisable metric to measure anomalies, and how to properly generate training samples of anomaly data? Classical effort in anomaly detection usually resorts to pixel-wise uncertainty or sample synthesis, which ignores the contextual information and sometimes requires auxiliary data with fine-grained annotations. On the contrary, in this paper, we exploit the strong context-dependent nature of the segmentation task and design an energy-guided self-supervised framework for anomaly segmentation, which optimizes an anomaly head by maximizing the likelihood of self-generated anomaly pixels. For this purpose, we design two estimators to model anomaly likelihood, one is a task-agnostic binary estimator and the other depicts the likelihood as residual of task-oriented joint energy. Based on the proposed estimators, we devise an adaptive self-supervised training framework, which exploits the contextual reliance and estimated likelihood to refine mask annotations in anomaly areas. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging Fishyscapes and Road Anomaly benchmarks, demonstrating that without any auxiliary data or synthetic models, our method can still achieve comparable performance to supervised competitors. Code is available at https://github.com/yuanpengtu/SLEEG.."
2302.06874,Robust Representation Learning with Self-Distillation for Domain   Generalization,"Despite the recent success of deep neural networks, there remains a need for effective methods to enhance domain generalization using vision transformers. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization technique called Robust Representation Learning with Self-Distillation (RRLD) comprising i) intermediate-block self-distillation and ii) augmentation-guided self-distillation to improve the generalization capabilities of transformer-based models on unseen domains. This approach enables the network to learn robust and general features that are invariant to different augmentations and domain shifts while effectively mitigating overfitting to source domains. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on PACS and OfficeHome benchmark datasets, as well as an industrial wafer semiconductor defect dataset. The results demonstrate that RRLD achieves robust and accurate generalization performance. We observe an average accuracy improvement in the range of 1.2% to 2.3% over the state-of-the-art on the three datasets."
2302.06891,UKnow: A Unified Knowledge Protocol with Multimodal Knowledge Graph   Datasets for Reasoning and Vision-Language Pre-Training,"This work presents a unified knowledge protocol, called UKnow, which facilitates knowledge-based studies from the perspective of data. Particularly focusing on visual and linguistic modalities, we categorize data knowledge into five unit types, namely, in-image, in-text, cross-image, cross-text, and image-text, and set up an efficient pipeline to help construct the multimodal knowledge graph from any data collection. Thanks to the logical information naturally contained in knowledge graph, organizing datasets under UKnow format opens up more possibilities of data usage compared to the commonly used image-text pairs. Following UKnow protocol, we collect, from public international news, a large-scale multimodal knowledge graph dataset that consists of 1,388,568 nodes (with 571,791 vision-related ones) and 3,673,817 triplets. The dataset is also annotated with rich event tags, including 11 coarse labels and 9,185 fine labels. Experiments on 4 benchmarks demonstrate the potential of UKnow in supporting common-sense reasoning and boosting vision-language pre-training with a single dataset, benefiting from its unified form of knowledge organization. See Appendix to download the dataset."
2302.06961,DualStreamFoveaNet: A Dual Stream Fusion Architecture with Anatomical   Awareness for Robust Fovea Localization,"Accurate fovea localization is essential for analyzing retinal diseases to prevent irreversible vision loss. While current deep learning-based methods outperform traditional ones, they still face challenges such as the lack of local anatomical landmarks around the fovea, the inability to robustly handle diseased retinal images, and the variations in image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture called DualStreamFoveaNet (DSFN) for multi-cue fusion. This architecture explicitly incorporates long-range connections and global features using retina and vessel distributions for robust fovea localization. We introduce a spatial attention mechanism in the dual-stream encoder to extract and fuse self-learned anatomical information, focusing more on features distributed along blood vessels and significantly reducing computational costs by decreasing token numbers. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and one large-scale private dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DSFN is more robust on both normal and diseased retina images and has better generalization capacity in cross-dataset experiments."
2302.06992,Hard-aware Instance Adaptive Self-training for Unsupervised Cross-domain   Semantic Segmentation,"The divergence between labeled training data and unlabeled testing data is a significant challenge for recent deep learning models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to solve such problem. Recent works show that self-training is a powerful approach to UDA. However, existing methods have difficulty in balancing the scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose a hard-aware instance adaptive self-training framework for UDA on the task of semantic segmentation. To effectively improve the quality and diversity of pseudo-labels, we develop a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with an instance adaptive selector. We further enrich the hard class pseudo-labels with inter-image information through a skillfully designed hard-aware pseudo-label augmentation. Besides, we propose the region-adaptive regularization to smooth the pseudo-label region and sharpen the non-pseudo-label region. For the non-pseudo-label region, consistency constraint is also constructed to introduce stronger supervision signals during model optimization. Our method is so concise and efficient that it is easy to be generalized to other UDA methods. Experiments on GTA5 to Cityscapes, SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, and Cityscapes to Oxford RobotCar demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/HIAST."
2302.07224,Painting 3D Nature in 2D: View Synthesis of Natural Scenes from a Single   Semantic Mask,"We introduce a novel approach that takes a single semantic mask as input to synthesize multi-view consistent color images of natural scenes, trained with a collection of single images from the Internet. Prior works on 3D-aware image synthesis either require multi-view supervision or learning category-level prior for specific classes of objects, which can hardly work for natural scenes. Our key idea to solve this challenging problem is to use a semantic field as the intermediate representation, which is easier to reconstruct from an input semantic mask and then translate to a radiance field with the assistance of off-the-shelf semantic image synthesis models. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline methods and produces photorealistic, multi-view consistent videos of a variety of natural scenes."
2302.07661,Depth- and Semantics-aware Multi-modal Domain Translation: Generating 3D   Panoramic Color Images from LiDAR Point Clouds,"This work presents a new depth- and semantics-aware conditional generative model, named TITAN-Next, for cross-domain image-to-image translation in a multi-modal setup between LiDAR and camera sensors. The proposed model leverages scene semantics as a mid-level representation and is able to translate raw LiDAR point clouds to RGB-D camera images by solely relying on semantic scene segments. We claim that this is the first framework of its kind and it has practical applications in autonomous vehicles such as providing a fail-safe mechanism and augmenting available data in the target image domain. The proposed model is evaluated on the large-scale and challenging Semantic-KITTI dataset, and experimental findings show that it considerably outperforms the original TITAN-Net and other strong baselines by 23.7$\%$ margin in terms of IoU."
2302.07944,Effective Data Augmentation With Diffusion Models,"Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains."
2302.07950,Self-Organising Neural Discrete Representation Learning \`a la Kohonen,"Unsupervised learning of discrete representations in neural networks (NNs) from continuous ones is essential for many modern applications. Vector Quantisation (VQ) has become popular for this, in particular in the context of generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), where the exponential moving average-based VQ (EMA-VQ) algorithm is often used. Here, we study an alternative VQ algorithm based on Kohonen's learning rule for the Self-Organising Map (KSOM; 1982). EMA-VQ is a special case of KSOM. KSOM is known to offer two potential benefits: empirically, it converges faster than EMA-VQ, and KSOM-generated discrete representations form a topological structure on the grid whose nodes are the discrete symbols, resulting in an artificial version of the brain's topographic map. We revisit these properties by using KSOM in VQ-VAEs for image processing. In our experiments, the speed-up compared to well-configured EMA-VQ is only observable at the beginning of training, but KSOM is generally much more robust, e.g., w.r.t. the choice of initialisation schemes."
2302.08062,Fossil Image Identification using Deep Learning Ensembles of Data   Augmented Multiviews,"Identification of fossil species is crucial to evolutionary studies. Recent advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image identification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images are often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensive and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great challenges to training deep learning based image classification models. To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and propose a multiview ensemble framework, which collects Original (O), Gray (G), and Skeleton (S) views of each fossil image reflecting its different characteristics to train multiple base models, and then makes the final decision via soft voting. Experiments on the largest fusulinid dataset with 2400 images show that the proposed OGS consistently outperforms baselines (using a single model for each view), and obtains superior or comparable performance compared to OOO (using three base models for three the same Original views). Besides, as the training data decreases, the proposed framework achieves more gains. While considering the identification consistency estimation with respect to human experts, OGS receives the highest agreement with the original labels of dataset and with the re-identifications of two human experts. The validation performance provides a quantitative estimation of consistency across different experts and genera. We conclude that the proposed framework can present state-of-the-art performance in the fusulinid fossil identification case study. This framework is designed for general fossil identification and it is expected to see applications to other fossil datasets in future work. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/houchengbin/Fossil-Image-Identification to benefit future research in fossil image identification."
2302.08102,Prompt Tuning of Deep Neural Networks for Speaker-adaptive Visual Speech   Recognition,"Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) aims to infer speech into text depending on lip movements alone. As it focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements, and this makes the VSR models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen speakers. In this paper, to remedy the performance degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically, motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover, by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID."
2302.08212,Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification via Patch-Mixed Cross-Modality   Learning,"Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same pedestrian from different modalities, where the challenges lie in the significant modality discrepancy. To alleviate the modality gap, recent methods generate intermediate images by GANs, grayscaling, or mixup strategies. However, these methods could introduce extra data distribution, and the semantic correspondence between the two modalities is not well learned. In this paper, we propose a Patch-Mixed Cross-Modality framework (PMCM), where two images of the same person from two modalities are split into patches and stitched into a new one for model learning. A part-alignment loss is introduced to regularize representation learning, and a patch-mixed modality learning loss is proposed to align between the modalities. In this way, the model learns to recognize a person through patches of different styles, thereby the modality semantic correspondence can be inferred. In addition, with the flexible image generation strategy, the patch-mixed images freely adjust the ratio of different modality patches, which could further alleviate the modality imbalance problem. On two VI-ReID datasets, we report new state-of-the-art performance with the proposed method."
2302.08274,Robust Human Motion Forecasting using Transformer-based Model,"Comprehending human motion is a fundamental challenge for developing Human-Robot Collaborative applications. Computer vision researchers have addressed this field by only focusing on reducing error in predictions, but not taking into account the requirements to facilitate its implementation in robots. In this paper, we propose a new model based on Transformer that simultaneously deals with the real time 3D human motion forecasting in the short and long term. Our 2-Channel Transformer (2CH-TR) is able to efficiently exploit the spatio-temporal information of a shortly observed sequence (400ms) and generates a competitive accuracy against the current state-of-the-art. 2CH-TR stands out for the efficient performance of the Transformer, being lighter and faster than its competitors. In addition, our model is tested in conditions where the human motion is severely occluded, demonstrating its robustness in reconstructing and predicting 3D human motion in a highly noisy environment. Our experiment results show that the proposed 2CH-TR outperforms the ST-Transformer, which is another state-of-the-art model based on the Transformer, in terms of reconstruction and prediction under the same conditions of input prefix. Our model reduces in 8.89% the mean squared error of ST-Transformer in short-term prediction, and 2.57% in long-term prediction in Human3.6M dataset with 400ms input prefix.

2302.08878,Less is More: The Influence of Pruning on the Explainability of CNNs,"Over the last century, deep learning models have become the state-of-the-art for solving complex computer vision problems. These modern computer vision models have millions of parameters, which presents two major challenges: (1) the increased computational requirements hamper the deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or IoT devices, and (2) explaining the complex decisions of such networks to humans is challenging. Network pruning is a technical approach to reduce the complexity of models, where less important parameters are removed. The work presented in this paper investigates whether this reduction in technical complexity also helps with perceived explainability. To do so, we conducted a pre-study and two human-grounded experiments, assessing the effects of different pruning ratios on explainability. Overall, we evaluate four different compression rates (i.e., 2, 4, 8, and 32) with 37 500 tasks on Mechanical Turk. Results indicate that lower compression rates have a positive influence on explainability, while higher compression rates show negative effects. Furthermore, we were able to identify sweet spots that increase both the perceived explainability and the model's performance."
2302.08890,Deep Learning for Event-based Vision: A Comprehensive Survey and   Benchmarks,"Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the per-pixel intensity changes asynchronously and produce event streams encoding the time, pixel position, and polarity (sign) of the intensity changes. Event cameras possess a myriad of advantages over canonical frame-based cameras, such as high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, etc. Being capable of capturing information in challenging visual conditions, event cameras have the potential to overcome the limitations of frame-based cameras in the computer vision and robotics community. In very recent years, deep learning (DL) has been brought to this emerging field and inspired active research endeavors in mining its potential. However, there is still a lack of taxonomies in DL techniques for event-based vision. We first scrutinize the typical event representations with quality enhancement methods as they play a pivotal role as inputs to the DL models. We then provide a comprehensive survey of existing DL-based methods by structurally grouping them into two major categories: 1) image/video reconstruction and restoration; 2) event-based scene understanding and 3D vision. We conduct benchmark experiments for the existing methods in some representative research directions, i.e., image reconstruction, deblurring, and object recognition, to identify some critical insights and problems. Finally, we have discussions regarding the challenges and provide new perspectives for inspiring more research studies."
2302.08913,Referential communication in heterogeneous communities of pre-trained   visual deep networks,"As large pre-trained image-processing neural networks are being embedded in autonomous agents such as self-driving cars or robots, the question arises of how such systems can communicate with each other about the surrounding world, despite their different architectures and training regimes. As a first step in this direction, we systematically explore the task of referential communication in a community of heterogeneous state-of-the-art pre-trained visual networks, showing that they can develop, in a self-supervised way, a shared protocol to refer to a target object among a set of candidates. This shared protocol can also be used, to some extent, to communicate about previously unseen object categories of different granularity. Moreover, a visual network that was not initially part of an existing community can learn the community's protocol with remarkable ease. Finally, we study, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the properties of the emergent protocol, providing some evidence that it is capturing high-level semantic features of objects."
2302.09027,CK-Transformer: Commonsense Knowledge Enhanced Transformers for   Referring Expression Comprehension,"The task of multimodal referring expression comprehension (REC), aiming at localizing an image region described by a natural language expression, has recently received increasing attention within the research comminity. In this paper, we specifically focus on referring expression comprehension with commonsense knowledge (KB-Ref), a task which typically requires reasoning beyond spatial, visual or semantic information. We propose a novel framework for Commonsense Knowledge Enhanced Transformers (CK-Transformer) which effectively integrates commonsense knowledge into the representations of objects in an image, facilitating identification of the target objects referred to by the expressions. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmarks for the task of KB-Ref. Our results show that the proposed CK-Transformer achieves a new state of the art, with an absolute improvement of 3.14% accuracy over the existing state of the art."
2302.09389,Vulnerability analysis of captcha using Deep learning,"Several websites improve their security and avoid dangerous Internet attacks by implementing CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), a type of verification to identify whether the end-user is human or a robot. The most prevalent type of CAPTCHA is text-based, designed to be easily recognized by humans while being unsolvable towards machines or robots. However, as deep learning technology progresses, development of convolutional neural network (CNN) models that predict text-based CAPTCHAs becomes easier. The purpose of this research is to investigate the flaws and vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA generating systems in order to design more resilient CAPTCHAs. To achieve this, we created CapNet, a Convolutional Neural Network. The proposed platform can evaluate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs"
2302.09411,MultiScale Probability Map guided Index Pooling with Attention-based   learning for Road and Building Segmentation,"Efficient road and building footprint extraction from satellite images are predominant in many remote sensing applications. However, precise segmentation map extraction is quite challenging due to the diverse building structures camouflaged by trees, similar spectral responses between the roads and buildings, and occlusions by heterogeneous traffic over the roads. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods focus on either enriched spatial semantics learning for the building extraction or the fine-grained road topology extraction. The profound semantic information loss due to the traditional pooling mechanisms in CNN generates fragmented and disconnected road maps and poorly segmented boundaries for the densely spaced small buildings in complex surroundings. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-aware segmentation framework, Multi-Scale Supervised Dilated Multiple-Path Attention Network (MSSDMPA-Net), equipped with two new modules Dynamic Attention Map Guided Index Pooling (DAMIP) and Dynamic Attention Map Guided Spatial and Channel Attention (DAMSCA) to precisely extract the building footprints and road maps from remotely sensed images. DAMIP mines the salient features by employing a novel index pooling mechanism to retain important geometric information. On the other hand, DAMSCA simultaneously extracts the multi-scale spatial and spectral features. Besides, using dilated convolution and multi-scale deep supervision in optimizing MSSDMPA-Net helps achieve stellar performance. Experimental results over multiple benchmark building and road extraction datasets, ensures MSSDMPA-Net as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for building and road extraction."
2302.09429,NU-AIR -- A Neuromorphic Urban Aerial Dataset for Detection and   Localization of Pedestrians and Vehicles,"This paper presents an open-source aerial neuromorphic dataset that captures pedestrians and vehicles moving in an urban environment. The dataset, titled NU-AIR, features 70.75 minutes of event footage acquired with a 640 x 480 resolution neuromorphic sensor mounted on a quadrotor operating in an urban environment. Crowds of pedestrians, different types of vehicles, and street scenes featuring busy urban environments are captured at different elevations and illumination conditions. Manual bounding box annotations of vehicles and pedestrians contained in the recordings are provided at a frequency of 30 Hz, yielding 93,204 labels in total. Evaluation of the dataset's fidelity is performed through comprehensive ablation study for three Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and training ten Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to validate the quality and reliability of both the dataset and corresponding annotations. All data and Python code to voxelize the data and subsequently train SNNs/DNNs has been open-sourced."
2302.09579,Evaluating Representations with Readout Model Switching,"Although much of the success of Deep Learning builds on learning good representations, a rigorous method to evaluate their quality is lacking. In this paper, we treat the evaluation of representations as a model selection problem and propose to use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to devise an evaluation metric. Contrary to the established practice of limiting the capacity of the readout model, we design a hybrid discrete and continuous-valued model space for the readout models and employ a switching strategy to combine their predictions. The MDL score takes model complexity, as well as data efficiency into account. As a result, the most appropriate model for the specific task and representation will be chosen, making it a unified measure for comparison. The proposed metric can be efficiently computed with an online method and we present results for pre-trained vision encoders of various architectures (ResNet and ViT) and objective functions (supervised and self-supervised) on a range of downstream tasks. We compare our methods with accuracy-based approaches and show that the latter are inconsistent when multiple readout models are used. Finally, we discuss important properties revealed by our evaluations such as model scaling, preferred readout model, and data efficiency."
2302.09585,StreamingFlow: Streaming Occupancy Forecasting with Asynchronous   Multi-modal Data Streams via Neural Ordinary Differential Equation,"Predicting the future occupancy states of the surrounding environment is a vital task for autonomous driving. However, current best-performing single-modality methods or multi-modality fusion perception methods are only able to predict uniform snapshots of future occupancy states and require strictly synchronized sensory data for sensor fusion. We propose a novel framework, StreamingFlow, to lift these strong limitations. StreamingFlow is a novel BEV occupancy predictor that ingests asynchronous multi-sensor data streams for fusion and performs streaming forecasting of the future occupancy map at any future timestamps. By integrating neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODE) into recurrent neural networks, StreamingFlow learns derivatives of BEV features over temporal horizons, updates the implicit sensor's BEV features as part of the fusion process, and propagates BEV states to the desired future time point. It shows good zero-shot generalization ability of prediction, reflected in the interpolation of the observed prediction time horizon and the reasonable inference of the unseen farther future period. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, nuScenes and Lyft L5, demonstrate that StreamingFlow significantly outperforms previous vision-based, LiDAR-based methods, and shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art fusion-based methods."
2302.09682,Dual Attention Model with Reinforcement Learning for Classification of   Histology Whole-Slide Images,"Digital whole slide images (WSIs) are generally captured at microscopic resolution and encompass extensive spatial data. Directly feeding these images to deep learning models is computationally intractable due to memory constraints, while downsampling the WSIs risks incurring information loss. Alternatively, splitting the WSIs into smaller patches may result in a loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel dual attention approach, consisting of two main components, both inspired by the visual examination process of a pathologist: The first soft attention model processes a low magnification view of the WSI to identify relevant regions of interest, followed by a custom sampling method to extract diverse and spatially distinct image tiles from the selected ROIs. The second component, the hard attention classification model further extracts a sequence of multi-resolution glimpses from each tile for classification. Since hard attention is non-differentiable, we train this component using reinforcement learning to predict the location of the glimpses. This approach allows the model to focus on essential regions instead of processing the entire tile, thereby aligning with a pathologist's way of diagnosis. The two components are trained in an end-to-end fashion using a joint loss function to demonstrate the efficacy of the model. The proposed model was evaluated on two WSI-level classification problems: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 scoring on breast cancer histology images and prediction of Intact/Loss status of two Mismatch Repair biomarkers from colorectal cancer histology images. We show that the proposed model achieves performance better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods while processing less than 10% of the WSI at the highest magnification and reducing the time required to infer the WSI-level label by more than 75%."
2302.09833,Domain-Specific Pre-training Improves Confidence in Whole Slide Image   Classification,"Whole Slide Images (WSIs) or histopathology images are used in digital pathology. WSIs pose great challenges to deep learning models for clinical diagnosis, owing to their size and lack of pixel-level annotations. With the recent advancements in computational pathology, newer multiple-instance learning-based models have been proposed. Multiple-instance learning for WSIs necessitates creating patches and uses the encoding of these patches for diagnosis. These models use generic pre-trained models (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) for patch encoding. The recently proposed KimiaNet, a DenseNet121 model pre-trained on TCGA slides, is a domain-specific pre-trained model. This paper shows the effect of domain-specific pre-training on WSI classification. To investigate the effect of domain-specific pre-training, we considered the current state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models, 1) CLAM, an attention-based model, and 2) TransMIL, a self-attention-based model, and evaluated the models' confidence and predictive performance in detecting primary brain tumors - gliomas. Domain-specific pre-training improves the confidence of the models and also achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of WSI-based glioma subtype classification, showing a high clinical applicability in assisting glioma diagnosis. We will publicly share our code and experimental results at https://github.com/soham-chitnis10/WSI-domain-specific."
2302.10035,Large-scale Multi-Modal Pre-trained Models: A Comprehensive Survey,"With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big models are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of these models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language processing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of these models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh researchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly introduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the conventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process, computer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key challenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and discuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures, and knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream tasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative, classification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis of the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks. Finally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may benefit future works. In addition, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for large-scale pre-trained multi-modal big models: https://github.com/wangxiao5791509/MultiModal_BigModels_Survey. This paper has been published by the journal Machine Intelligence Research (MIR), https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11633-022-1410-8, DOI: 10.1007/s11633-022-1410-8, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 447-482, 2023."
2302.10174,Towards Universal Fake Image Detectors that Generalize Across Generative   Models,"With generative models proliferating at a rapid rate, there is a growing need for general purpose fake image detectors. In this work, we first show that the existing paradigm, which consists of training a deep network for real-vs-fake classification, fails to detect fake images from newer breeds of generative models when trained to detect GAN fake images. Upon analysis, we find that the resulting classifier is asymmetrically tuned to detect patterns that make an image fake. The real class becomes a sink class holding anything that is not fake, including generated images from models not accessible during training. Building upon this discovery, we propose to perform real-vs-fake classification without learning; i.e., using a feature space not explicitly trained to distinguish real from fake images. We use nearest neighbor and linear probing as instantiations of this idea. When given access to the feature space of a large pretrained vision-language model, the very simple baseline of nearest neighbor classification has surprisingly good generalization ability in detecting fake images from a wide variety of generative models; e.g., it improves upon the SoTA by +15.07 mAP and +25.90% acc when tested on unseen diffusion and autoregressive models."
2302.10306,Deep Convolutional Framelet Denoising for Panoramic by Mixed Wavelet   Integration,"Enhancing quality and removing noise during preprocessing is one of the most critical steps in image processing. X-ray images are created by photons colliding with atoms and the variation in scattered noise absorption. This noise leads to a deterioration in the graph's medical quality and, at times, results in repetition, thereby increasing the patient's effective dose. One of the most critical challenges in this area has consistently been lowering the image noise. Techniques like BM3d, low-pass filters, and Autoencoder have taken this step. Owing to their structural design and high rate of repetition, neural networks employing diverse architectures have, over the past decade, achieved noise reduction with satisfactory outcomes, surpassing the traditional BM3D and low-pass filters. The combination of the Hankel matrix with neural networks represents one of these configurations. The Hankel matrix aims to identify a local circle by separating individual values into local and non-local components, utilizing a non-local matrix. A non-local matrix can be created using the wave or DCT. This paper suggests integrating the waveform with the Daubechies (D4) wavelet due to its higher energy concentration and employs the u-Net neural network architecture, which incorporates the waveform exclusively at each stage. The outcomes were evaluated using the PSNR and SSIM criteria, and the outcomes were verified by using various waves. The effectiveness of a one-wave network has increased from 0.5% to 1.2%, according to studies done on other datasets"
2302.10341,DC4L: Distribution Shift Recovery via Data-Driven Control for Deep   Learning Models,"Deep neural networks have repeatedly been shown to be non-robust to the uncertainties of the real world, even to naturally occurring ones. A vast majority of current approaches have focused on data-augmentation methods to expand the range of perturbations that the classifier is exposed to while training. A relatively unexplored avenue that is equally promising involves sanitizing an image as a preprocessing step, depending on the nature of perturbation. In this paper, we propose to use control for learned models to recover from distribution shifts online. Specifically, our method applies a sequence of semantic-preserving transformations to bring the shifted data closer in distribution to the training set, as measured by the Wasserstein distance. Our approach is to 1) formulate the problem of distribution shift recovery as a Markov decision process, which we solve using reinforcement learning, 2) identify a minimum condition on the data for our method to be applied, which we check online using a binary classifier, and 3) employ dimensionality reduction through orthonormal projection to aid in our estimates of the Wasserstein distance. We provide theoretical evidence that orthonormal projection preserves characteristics of the data at the distributional level. We apply our distribution shift recovery approach to the ImageNet-C benchmark for distribution shifts, demonstrating an improvement in average accuracy of up to 14.21% across a variety of state-of-the-art ImageNet classifiers. We further show that our method generalizes to composites of shifts from the ImageNet-C benchmark, achieving improvements in average accuracy of up to 9.81%. Finally, we test our method on CIFAR-100-C and report improvements of up to 8.25%."
2302.10463,Vision-based Multi-future Trajectory Prediction: A Survey,"Vision-based trajectory prediction is an important task that supports safe and intelligent behaviours in autonomous systems. Many advanced approaches have been proposed over the years with improved spatial and temporal feature extraction. However, human behaviour is naturally diverse and uncertain. Given the past trajectory and surrounding environment information, an agent can have multiple plausible trajectories in the future. To tackle this problem, an essential task named multi-future trajectory prediction (MTP) has recently been studied. This task aims to generate a diverse, acceptable and explainable distribution of future predictions for each agent. In this paper, we present the first survey for MTP with our unique taxonomies and a comprehensive analysis of frameworks, datasets and evaluation metrics. We also compare models on existing MTP datasets and conduct experiments on the ForkingPath dataset. Finally, we discuss multiple future directions that can help researchers develop novel multi-future trajectory prediction systems and other diverse learning tasks similar to MTP."
2302.10473,Oriented Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images using Deep   Learning: A Survey,"Oriented object detection is one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks in remote sensing, aiming to locate and classify objects with arbitrary orientations. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of oriented object detection. Given the rapid development of this field, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in oriented object detection. To be specific, we begin by tracing the technical evolution from horizontal object detection to oriented object detection and highlighting the specific challenges, including feature misalignment, spatial misalignment, and oriented bounding box (OBB) regression problems. Subsequently, we further categorize existing methods into detection framework, OBB regression, and feature representations, and provide an in-depth discussion on how these approaches address the above challenges. In addition, we cover several publicly available datasets and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive comparison and analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Toward the end of this paper, we identify several future directions for oriented object detection."
2302.10494,The Role of Masking for Efficient Supervised Knowledge Distillation of   Vision Transformers,"Knowledge distillation is an effective method for training lightweight vision models. However, acquiring teacher supervision for training samples is often costly, especially from large-scale models like vision transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we develop a simple framework to reduce the supervision cost of ViT distillation: masking out a fraction of input tokens given to the teacher. By masking input tokens, one can skip the computations associated with the masked tokens without requiring any change to teacher parameters or architecture. We find that masking patches with the lowest student attention scores is highly effective, saving up to 50% of teacher FLOPs without any drop in student accuracy, while other masking criterion leads to suboptimal efficiency gains. Through in-depth analyses, we reveal that the student-guided masking provides a good curriculum to the student, making teacher supervision easier to follow during the early stage and challenging in the later stage."
2302.10630,LIT-Former: Linking In-plane and Through-plane Transformers for   Simultaneous CT Image Denoising and Deblurring,"This paper studies 3D low-dose computed tomography (CT) imaging. Although various deep learning methods were developed in this context, typically they focus on 2D images and perform denoising due to low-dose and deblurring for super-resolution separately. Up to date, little work was done for simultaneous in-plane denoising and through-plane deblurring, which is important to obtain high-quality 3D CT images with lower radiation and faster imaging speed. For this task, a straightforward method is to directly train an end-to-end 3D network. However, it demands much more training data and expensive computational costs. Here, we propose to link in-plane and through-plane transformers for simultaneous in-plane denoising and through-plane deblurring, termed as LIT-Former, which can efficiently synergize in-plane and through-plane sub-tasks for 3D CT imaging and enjoy the advantages of both convolution and transformer networks. LIT-Former has two novel designs: efficient multi-head self-attention modules (eMSM) and efficient convolutional feedforward networks (eCFN). First, eMSM integrates in-plane 2D self-attention and through-plane 1D self-attention to efficiently capture global interactions of 3D self-attention, the core unit of transformer networks. Second, eCFN integrates 2D convolution and 1D convolution to extract local information of 3D convolution in the same fashion. As a result, the proposed LIT-Former synergize these two subtasks, significantly reducing the computational complexity as compared to 3D counterparts and enabling rapid convergence. Extensive experimental results on simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art models. The source code is made available at https://github.com/hao1635/LIT-Former."
2302.10634,A Deep Learning-Based Fully Automated Pipeline for Regurgitant Mitral   Valve Anatomy Analysis From 3D Echocardiography,"Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE) is the recommended imaging technique for the assessment of mitral valve (MV) morphology and lesions in case of mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring surgical or transcatheter repair. Such assessment is key to thorough intervention planning and to intraprocedural guidance. However, it requires segmentation from 3DTEE images, which is timeconsuming, operator-dependent, and often merely qualitative. In the present work, a novel workflow to quantify the patient-specific MV geometry from 3DTEE is proposed. The developed approach relies on a 3D multi-decoder residual convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture for multi-class segmentation of MV annulus and leaflets. The CNN was trained and tested on a dataset comprising 55 3DTEE examinations of MR-affected patients. After training, the CNN is embedded into a fully automatic, and hence fully repeatable, pipeline that refines the predicted segmentation, detects MV anatomical landmarks and quantifies MV morphology. The trained 3D CNN achieves an average Dice score of $0.82 \pm 0.06$, mean surface distance of $0.43 \pm 0.14$ mm and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) of $3.57 \pm 1.56$ mm before segmentation refinement, outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline residual U-Net architecture, and provides an unprecedented multi-class segmentation of the annulus, anterior and posterior leaflet. The automatic 3D linear morphological measurements of the annulus and leaflets, specifically diameters and lengths, exhibit differences of less than 1.45 mm when compared to ground truth values. These measurements also demonstrate strong overall agreement with analyses conducted by semi-automated commercial software. The whole process requires minimal user interaction and requires approximately 15 seconds"
2302.10763,Contrastive Learning and the Emergence of Attributes Associations,"In response to an object presentation, supervised learning schemes generally respond with a parsimonious label. Upon a similar presentation we humans respond again with a label, but are flooded, in addition, by a myriad of associations. A significant portion of these consist of the presented object attributes. Contrastive learning is a semi-supervised learning scheme based on the application of identity preserving transformations on the object input representations. It is conjectured in this work that these same applied transformations preserve, in addition to the identity of the presented object, also the identity of its semantically meaningful attributes. The corollary of this is that the output representations of such a contrastive learning scheme contain valuable information not only for the classification of the presented object, but also for the presence or absence decision of any attribute of interest. Simulation results which demonstrate this idea and the feasibility of this conjecture are presented."
2302.10764,On The Coherence of Quantitative Evaluation of Visual Explanations,"Recent years have shown an increased development of methods for justifying the predictions of neural networks through visual explanations. These explanations usually take the form of heatmaps which assign a saliency (or relevance) value to each pixel of the input image that expresses how relevant the pixel is for the prediction of a label.   Complementing this development, evaluation methods have been proposed to assess the ""goodness"" of such explanations. On the one hand, some of these methods rely on synthetic datasets. However, this introduces the weakness of having limited guarantees regarding their applicability on more realistic settings. On the other hand, some methods rely on metrics for objective evaluation. However the level to which some of these evaluation methods perform with respect to each other is uncertain.   Taking this into account, we conduct a comprehensive study on a subset of the ImageNet-1k validation set where we evaluate a number of different commonly-used explanation methods following a set of evaluation methods. We complement our study with sanity checks on the studied evaluation methods as a means to investigate their reliability and the impact of characteristics of the explanations on the evaluation methods.   Results of our study suggest that there is a lack of coherency on the grading provided by some of the considered evaluation methods. Moreover, we have identified some characteristics of the explanations, e.g. sparsity, which can have a significant effect on the performance."
2302.10798,Learning a Consensus Sub-Network with Polarization Regularization and   One Pass Training,"The subject of green AI has been gaining attention within the deep learning community given the recent trend of ever larger and more complex neural network models. Existing solutions for reducing the computational load of training at inference time usually involve pruning the network parameters. Pruning schemes often create extra overhead either by iterative training and fine-tuning for static pruning or repeated computation of a dynamic pruning graph. We propose a new parameter pruning strategy for learning a lighter-weight sub-network that minimizes the energy cost while maintaining comparable performance to the fully parameterised network on given downstream tasks. Our proposed pruning scheme is green-oriented, as it only requires a one-off training to discover the optimal static sub-networks by dynamic pruning methods. The pruning scheme consists of a binary gating module and a polarizing loss function to uncover sub-networks with user-defined sparsity. Our method enables pruning and training simultaneously, which saves energy in both the training and inference phases and avoids extra computational overhead from gating modules at inference time. Our results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny Imagenet suggest that our scheme can remove 50% of connections in deep networks with <1% reduction in classification accuracy. Compared to other related pruning methods, our method demonstrates a lower drop in accuracy for equivalent reductions in computational cost."
2302.10883,Combining Blockchain and Biometrics: A Survey on Technical Aspects and a   First Legal Analysis,"Biometric recognition as a unique, hard-to-forge, and efficient way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integrating it into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the very attractive decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received both by the research and industry in the past years and it is being increasingly deployed nowadays in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate what would be the pros and cons and what would be the best applications when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of technical literature research on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration to shed light on challenges and potentials. While this combination is still in its infancy and a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic understanding of blockchains applicability in the biometric sector. This study demonstrates that combining blockchain and biometrics would be beneficial for novel applications in biometrics such as the PKI mechanism, distributed trusted service, and identity management. However, blockchain networks at their current stage are not efficient and economical for real-time applications. From a legal point of view, the allocation of accountability remains a main issue, while other difficulties remain, such as conducting a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment. Finally, it supplies technical and legal recommendations to reap the benefits and mitigate the risks of the combination."
2302.10970,Differentiable Rendering with Reparameterized Volume Sampling,"In view synthesis, a neural radiance field approximates underlying density and radiance fields based on a sparse set of scene pictures. To generate a pixel of a novel view, it marches a ray through the pixel and computes a weighted sum of radiance emitted from a dense set of ray points. This rendering algorithm is fully differentiable and facilitates gradient-based optimization of the fields. However, in practice, only a tiny opaque portion of the ray contributes most of the radiance to the sum. We propose a simple end-to-end differentiable sampling algorithm based on inverse transform sampling. It generates samples according to the probability distribution induced by the density field and picks non-transparent points on the ray. We utilize the algorithm in two ways. First, we propose a novel rendering approach based on Monte Carlo estimates. This approach allows for evaluating and optimizing a neural radiance field with just a few radiance field calls per ray. Second, we use the sampling algorithm to modify the hierarchical scheme proposed in the original NeRF work. We show that our modification improves reconstruction quality of hierarchical models, at the same time simplifying the training procedure by removing the need for auxiliary proposal network losses."
2302.11325,Video-SwinUNet: Spatio-temporal Deep Learning Framework for VFSS   Instance Segmentation,"This paper presents a deep learning framework for medical video segmentation. Convolution neural network (CNN) and transformer-based methods have achieved great milestones in medical image segmentation tasks due to their incredible semantic feature encoding and global information comprehension abilities. However, most existing approaches ignore a salient aspect of medical video data - the temporal dimension. Our proposed framework explicitly extracts features from neighbouring frames across the temporal dimension and incorporates them with a temporal feature blender, which then tokenises the high-level spatio-temporal feature to form a strong global feature encoded via a Swin Transformer. The final segmentation results are produced via a UNet-like encoder-decoder architecture. Our model outperforms other approaches by a significant margin and improves the segmentation benchmarks on the VFSS2022 dataset, achieving a dice coefficient of 0.8986 and 0.8186 for the two datasets tested. Our studies also show the efficacy of the temporal feature blending scheme and cross-dataset transferability of learned capabilities. Code and models are fully available at https://github.com/SimonZeng7108/Video-SwinUNet."
2302.11364,Vision-Based Estimation of Small Body Rotational State during the   Approach Phase,"The heterogeneity of the small body population complicates the prediction of small body properties before the spacecraft's arrival. In the context of autonomous small body exploration, it is crucial to develop algorithms that estimate the small body characteristics before orbit insertion and close proximity operations. This paper develops a vision-based estimation of the small-body rotational state (i.e., the center of rotation and rotation axis direction) during the approach phase. In this mission phase, the spacecraft observes the rotating celestial body and tracks features in images. As feature tracks are the projection of the landmarks' circular movement, the possible rotation axes are computed. Then, the rotation axis solution is chosen among the possible candidates by exploiting feature motion and a heuristic approach. Finally, the center of rotation is estimated from the center of brightness. The algorithm is tested on more than 800 test cases with two different asteroids (i.e., Bennu and Itokawa), three different lighting conditions, and more than 100 different rotation axis orientations. Each test case is composed of about 250 synthetic images of the asteroid which are used to track features and determine the rotational state. Results show that the error between the true rotation axis and its estimation is below $10^{\circ}$ for $80\%$ of the considered test cases, implying that the proposed algorithm is a suitable method for autonomous small body characterization."
2302.11427,Enhanced Face Authentication With Separate Loss Functions,"The overall objective of the main project is to propose and develop a system of facial authentication in unlocking phones or applications in phones using facial recognition. The system will include four separate architectures: face detection, face recognition, face spoofing, and classification of closed eyes. In which, we consider the problem of face recognition to be the most important, determining the true identity of the person standing in front of the screen with absolute accuracy is what facial recognition systems need to achieve. Along with the development of the face recognition problem, the problem of the anti-fake face is also gradually becoming popular and equally important. Our goal is to propose and develop two loss functions: LMCot and Double Loss. Then apply them to the face authentication process."
2302.11464,Gap-closing Matters: Perceptual Quality Evaluation and Optimization of   Low-Light Image Enhancement,"There is a growing consensus in the research community that the optimization of low-light image enhancement approaches should be guided by the visual quality perceived by end users. Despite the substantial efforts invested in the design of low-light enhancement algorithms, there has been comparatively limited focus on assessing subjective and objective quality systematically. To mitigate this gap and provide a clear path towards optimizing low-light image enhancement for better visual quality, we propose a gap-closing framework. In particular, our gap-closing framework starts with the creation of a large-scale dataset for Subjective QUality Assessment of REconstructed LOw-Light Images (SQUARE-LOL). This database serves as the foundation for studying the quality of enhanced images and conducting a comprehensive subjective user study. Subsequently, we propose an objective quality assessment measure that plays a critical role in bridging the gap between visual quality and enhancement. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed objective quality measure can be incorporated into the process of optimizing the learning of the enhancement model toward perceptual optimality. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through both the accuracy of quality prediction and the perceptual quality of image enhancement. Our database and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Baoliang93/IACA_For_Lowlight_IQA."
2302.11510,Selective experience replay compression using coresets for lifelong deep   reinforcement learning in medical imaging,"Selective experience replay is a popular strategy for integrating lifelong learning with deep reinforcement learning. Selective experience replay aims to recount selected experiences from previous tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, selective experience replay based techniques are model agnostic and allow experiences to be shared across different models. However, storing experiences from all previous tasks make lifelong learning using selective experience replay computationally very expensive and impractical as the number of tasks increase. To that end, we propose a reward distribution-preserving coreset compression technique for compressing experience replay buffers stored for selective experience replay.   We evaluated the coreset compression technique on the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) dataset for the task of ventricle localization and on the whole-body MRI for localization of left knee cap, left kidney, right trochanter, left lung, and spleen. The coreset lifelong learning models trained on a sequence of 10 different brain MR imaging environments demonstrated excellent performance localizing the ventricle with a mean pixel error distance of 12.93 for the compression ratio of 10x. In comparison, the conventional lifelong learning model localized the ventricle with a mean pixel distance of 10.87. Similarly, the coreset lifelong learning models trained on whole-body MRI demonstrated no significant difference (p=0.28) between the 10x compressed coreset lifelong learning models and conventional lifelong learning models for all the landmarks. The mean pixel distance for the 10x compressed models across all the landmarks was 25.30, compared to 19.24 for the conventional lifelong learning models. Our results demonstrate that the potential of the coreset-based ERB compression method for compressing experiences without a significant drop in performance."
2302.11517,A Global and Patch-wise Contrastive Loss for Accurate Automated Exudate   Detection,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading global cause of blindness. Early detection of hard exudates plays a crucial role in identifying DR, which aids in treating diabetes and preventing vision loss. However, the unique characteristics of hard exudates, ranging from their inconsistent shapes to indistinct boundaries, pose significant challenges to existing segmentation techniques. To address these issues, we present a novel supervised contrastive learning framework to optimize hard exudate segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a patch-wise density contrasting scheme to distinguish between areas with varying lesion concentrations, and therefore improve the model's proficiency in segmenting small lesions. To handle the ambiguous boundaries, we develop a discriminative edge inspection module to dynamically analyze the pixels that lie around the boundaries and accurately delineate the exudates. Upon evaluation using the IDRiD dataset and comparison with state-of-the-art frameworks, our method exhibits its effectiveness and shows potential for computer-assisted hard exudate detection. The code to replicate experiments is available at github.com/wetang7/HECL/."
2302.11522,Evaluation of Extra Pixel Interpolation with Mask Processing for Medical   Image Segmentation with Deep Learning,"Current mask processing operations rely on interpolation algorithms that do not produce extra pixels, such as nearest neighbor (NN) interpolation, as opposed to algorithms that do produce extra pixels, like bicubic (BIC) or bilinear (BIL) interpolation. In our previous study, the author proposed an alternative approach to NN-based mask processing and evaluated its effects on deep learning training outcomes. In this study, the author evaluated the effects of both BIC-based image and mask processing and BIC-and-NN-based image and mask processing versus NN-based image and mask processing. The evaluation revealed that the BIC-BIC model/network was an 8.9578 % (with image size 256 x 256) and a 1.0496 % (with image size 384 x 384) increase of the NN-NN network compared to the NN-BIC network which was an 8.3127 % (with image size 256 x 256) and a 0.2887 % (with image size 384 x 384) increase of the NN-NN network."
2302.11552,"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Compositional Generation with Energy-Based   Diffusion Models and MCMC","Since their introduction, diffusion models have quickly become the prevailing approach to generative modeling in many domains. They can be interpreted as learning the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density functions. This interpretation has motivated classifier-based and classifier-free guidance as methods for post-hoc control of diffusion models. In this work, we build upon these ideas using the score-based interpretation of diffusion models, and explore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models for tasks involving compositional generation and guidance. In particular, we investigate why certain types of composition fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that the sampler (not the model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers, inspired by MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation. Further, we propose an energy-based parameterization of diffusion models which enables the use of new compositional operators and more sophisticated, Metropolis-corrected samplers. Intriguingly we find these samplers lead to notable improvements in compositional generation across a wide set of problems such as classifier-guided ImageNet modeling and compositional text-to-image generation."
2302.11571,Personalized and privacy-preserving federated heterogeneous medical   image analysis with PPPML-HMI,"Heterogeneous data is endemic due to the use of diverse models and settings of devices by hospitals in the field of medical imaging. However, there are few open-source frameworks for federated heterogeneous medical image analysis with personalization and privacy protection simultaneously without the demand to modify the existing model structures or to share any private data. In this paper, we proposed PPPML-HMI, an open-source learning paradigm for personalized and privacy-preserving federated heterogeneous medical image analysis. To our best knowledge, personalization and privacy protection were achieved simultaneously for the first time under the federated scenario by integrating the PerFedAvg algorithm and designing our novel cyclic secure aggregation with the homomorphic encryption algorithm. To show the utility of PPPML-HMI, we applied it to a simulated classification task namely the classification of healthy people and patients from the RAD-ChestCT Dataset, and one real-world segmentation task namely the segmentation of lung infections from COVID-19 CT scans. For the real-world task, PPPML-HMI achieved $\sim$5\% higher Dice score on average compared to conventional FL under the heterogeneous scenario. Meanwhile, we applied the improved deep leakage from gradients to simulate adversarial attacks and showed the solid privacy-preserving capability of PPPML-HMI. By applying PPPML-HMI to both tasks with different neural networks, a varied number of users, and sample sizes, we further demonstrated the strong robustness of PPPML-HMI."
2302.11861,Out-of-Domain Robustness via Targeted Augmentations,"Models trained on one set of domains often suffer performance drops on unseen domains, e.g., when wildlife monitoring models are deployed in new camera locations. In this work, we study principles for designing data augmentations for out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. In particular, we focus on real-world scenarios in which some domain-dependent features are robust, i.e., some features that vary across domains are predictive OOD. For example, in the wildlife monitoring application above, image backgrounds vary across camera locations but indicate habitat type, which helps predict the species of photographed animals. Motivated by theoretical analysis on a linear setting, we propose targeted augmentations, which selectively randomize spurious domain-dependent features while preserving robust ones. We prove that targeted augmentations improve OOD performance, allowing models to generalize better with fewer domains. In contrast, existing approaches such as generic augmentations, which fail to randomize domain-dependent features, and domain-invariant augmentations, which randomize all domain-dependent features, both perform poorly OOD. In experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that targeted augmentations set new states-of-the-art for OOD performance by 3.2-15.2 percentage points."
2302.11947,Real-Time Damage Detection in Fiber Lifting Ropes Using Lightweight   Convolutional Neural Networks,"The health and safety hazards posed by worn crane lifting ropes mandate periodic inspection for damage. This task is time-consuming, prone to human error, halts operation, and may result in the premature disposal of ropes. Therefore, we propose using efficient deep learning and computer vision methods to automate the process of detecting damaged ropes. Specifically, we present a vision-based system for detecting damage in synthetic fiber rope images using lightweight convolutional neural networks. We develop a camera-based apparatus to photograph the lifting rope's surface, while in operation, and capture the progressive wear-and-tear as well as the more significant degradation in the rope's health state. Experts from Konecranes annotate the collected images in accordance with the rope's condition; normal or damaged. Then, we pre-process the images, systematically design a deep learning model, evaluate its detection and prediction performance, analyze its computational complexity, and compare it with various other models. Experimental results show the proposed model outperforms other similar techniques with 96.5% accuracy, 94.8% precision, 98.3% recall, 96.5% F1-score, and 99.3% AUC. Besides, they demonstrate the model's real-time operation, low memory footprint, robustness to various environmental and operational conditions, and adequacy for deployment in industrial applications such as lifting, mooring, towing, climbing, and sailing."
2302.12172,Vision-Language Generative Model for View-Specific Chest X-ray   Generation,"Synthetic medical data generation has opened up new possibilities in the healthcare domain, offering a powerful tool for simulating clinical scenarios, enhancing diagnostic and treatment quality, gaining granular medical knowledge, and accelerating the development of unbiased algorithms. In this context, we present a novel approach called ViewXGen, designed to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on general domain pipelines using only radiology reports to generate frontal-view chest X-rays. Our approach takes into consideration the diverse view positions found in the dataset, enabling the generation of chest X-rays with specific views, which marks a significant advancement in the field. To achieve this, we introduce a set of specially designed tokens for each view position, tailoring the generation process to the user's preferences. Furthermore, we leverage multi-view chest X-rays as input, incorporating valuable information from different views within the same study. This integration rectifies potential errors and contributes to faithfully capturing abnormal findings in chest X-ray generation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted statistical analyses, evaluating its performance in a clinical efficacy metric on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Also, human evaluation demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of ViewXGen, particularly in producing realistic view-specific X-rays that closely resemble the original images."
2302.12491,Joint Learning of Blind Super-Resolution and Crack Segmentation for   Realistic Degraded Images,"This paper proposes crack segmentation augmented by super resolution (SR) with deep neural networks. In the proposed method, a SR network is jointly trained with a binary segmentation network in an end-to-end manner. This joint learning allows the SR network to be optimized for improving segmentation results. For realistic scenarios, the SR network is extended from non-blind to blind for processing a low-resolution image degraded by unknown blurs. The joint network is improved by our proposed two extra paths that further encourage the mutual optimization between SR and segmentation. Comparative experiments with State of The Art (SoTA) segmentation methods demonstrate the superiority of our joint learning, and various ablation studies prove the effects of our contributions."
2302.12720,Surface Recognition for e-Scooter Using Smartphone IMU Sensor,"In recent years, as the use of micromobility gained popularity, technological challenges connected to e-scooters became increasingly important. This paper focuses on road surface recognition, an important task in this area. A reliable and accurate method for road surface recognition can help improve the safety and stability of the vehicle. Here a data-driven method is proposed to recognize if an e-scooter is on a road or a sidewalk. The proposed method uses only the widely available inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on a smartphone device. deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to infer whether an e-scooteris driving on a road or on a sidewalk by solving a binary classification problem. A data set is collected and several different deep models as well as classical machine learning approaches for the binary classification problem are applied and compared. Experiment results on a route containing the two surfaces are presented demonstrating the DNNs ability to distinguish between them."
2302.12828,SplineCam: Exact Visualization and Characterization of Deep Network   Geometry and Decision Boundaries,"Current Deep Network (DN) visualization and interpretability methods rely heavily on data space visualizations such as scoring which dimensions of the data are responsible for their associated prediction or generating new data features or samples that best match a given DN unit or representation. In this paper, we go one step further by developing the first provably exact method for computing the geometry of a DN's mapping - including its decision boundary - over a specified region of the data space. By leveraging the theory of Continuous Piece-Wise Linear (CPWL) spline DNs, SplineCam exactly computes a DNs geometry without resorting to approximations such as sampling or architecture simplification. SplineCam applies to any DN architecture based on CPWL nonlinearities, including (leaky-)ReLU, absolute value, maxout, and max-pooling and can also be applied to regression DNs such as implicit neural representations. Beyond decision boundary visualization and characterization, SplineCam enables one to compare architectures, measure generalizability and sample from the decision boundary on or off the manifold.

2302.12986,Self-similarity Driven Scale-invariant Learning for Weakly Supervised   Person Search,"Weakly supervised person search aims to jointly detect and match persons with only bounding box annotations. Existing approaches typically focus on improving the features by exploring relations of persons. However, scale variation problem is a more severe obstacle and under-studied that a person often owns images with different scales (resolutions). On the one hand, small-scale images contain less information of a person, thus affecting the accuracy of the generated pseudo labels. On the other hand, the similarity of cross-scale images is often smaller than that of images with the same scale for a person, which will increase the difficulty of matching. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel one-step framework, named Self-similarity driven Scale-invariant Learning (SSL). Scale invariance can be explored based on the self-similarity prior that it shows the same statistical properties of an image at different scales. To this end, we introduce a Multi-scale Exemplar Branch to guide the network in concentrating on the foreground and learning scale-invariant features by hard exemplars mining. To enhance the discriminative power of the features in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a dynamic multi-label prediction which progressively seeks true labels for training. It is adaptable to different types of unlabeled data and serves as a compensation for clustering based strategy. Experiments on PRW and CUHK-SYSU databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
2302.13056,SATBA: An Invisible Backdoor Attack Based On Spatial Attention,"Backdoor attack has emerged as a novel and concerning threat to AI security. These attacks involve the training of Deep Neural Network (DNN) on datasets that contain hidden trigger patterns. Although the poisoned model behaves normally on benign samples, it exhibits abnormal behavior on samples containing the trigger pattern. However, most existing backdoor attacks suffer from two significant drawbacks: their trigger patterns are visible and easy to detect by backdoor defense or even human inspection, and their injection process results in the loss of natural sample features and trigger patterns, thereby reducing the attack success rate and model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack named SATBA that overcomes these limitations using spatial attention and an U-net based model. The attack process begins by using spatial attention to extract meaningful data features and generate trigger patterns associated with clean images. Then, an U-shaped model is used to embed these trigger patterns into the original data without causing noticeable feature loss. We evaluate our attack on three prominent image classification DNN across three standard datasets. The results demonstrate that SATBA achieves high attack success rate while maintaining robustness against backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we conduct extensive image similarity experiments to emphasize the stealthiness of our attack strategy. Overall, SATBA presents a promising approach to backdoor attack, addressing the shortcomings of previous methods and showcasing its effectiveness in evading detection and maintaining high attack success rate."
2302.13080,Does a Neural Network Really Encode Symbolic Concepts?,"Recently, a series of studies have tried to extract interactions between input variables modeled by a DNN and define such interactions as concepts encoded by the DNN. However, strictly speaking, there still lacks a solid guarantee whether such interactions indeed represent meaningful concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the trustworthiness of interaction concepts from four perspectives. Extensive empirical studies have verified that a well-trained DNN usually encodes sparse, transferable, and discriminative concepts, which is partially aligned with human intuition."
2302.13091,Explaining Generalization Power of a DNN Using Interactive Concepts,"This paper explains the generalization power of a deep neural network (DNN) from the perspective of interactions. Although there is no universally accepted definition of the concepts encoded by a DNN, the sparsity of interactions in a DNN has been proved, i.e., the output score of a DNN can be well explained by a small number of interactions between input variables. In this way, to some extent, we can consider such interactions as interactive concepts encoded by the DNN. Therefore, in this paper, we derive an analytic explanation of inconsistency of concepts of different complexities. This may shed new lights on using the generalization power of concepts to explain the generalization power of the entire DNN. Besides, we discover that the DNN with stronger generalization power usually learns simple concepts more quickly and encodes fewer complex concepts. We also discover the detouring dynamics of learning complex concepts, which explains both the high learning difficulty and the low generalization power of complex concepts. The code will be released when the paper is accepted."
2302.13170,Partial Label Learning for Emotion Recognition from EEG,"Fully supervised learning has recently achieved promising performance in various electroencephalography (EEG) learning tasks by training on large datasets with ground truth labels. However, labeling EEG data for affective experiments is challenging, as it can be difficult for participants to accurately distinguish between similar emotions, resulting in ambiguous labeling (reporting multiple emotions for one EEG instance). This notion could cause model performance degradation, as the ground truth is hidden within multiple candidate labels. To address this issue, Partial Label Learning (PLL) has been proposed to identify the ground truth from candidate labels during the training phase, and has shown good performance in the computer vision domain. However, PLL methods have not yet been adopted for EEG representation learning or implemented for emotion recognition tasks. In this paper, we adapt and re-implement six state-of-the-art PLL approaches for emotion recognition from EEG on two large emotion datasets (SEED-IV and SEED-V). These datasets contain four and five categories of emotions, respectively. We evaluate the performance of all methods in classical, circumplex-based and real-world experiments. The results show that PLL methods can achieve strong results in affective computing from EEG and achieve comparable performance to fully supervised learning. We also investigate the effect of label disambiguation, a key step in many PLL methods. The results show that in most cases, label disambiguation would benefit the model when the candidate labels are generated based on their similarities to the ground truth rather than obeying a uniform distribution. This finding suggests the potential of using label disambiguation-based PLL methods for circumplex-based and real-world affective tasks."
2302.13251,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Low-dose CT Reconstruction via   Bayesian Uncertainty Alignment,"Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) image reconstruction techniques can reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining acceptable imaging quality. Deep learning is widely used in this problem, but the performance of testing data (a.k.a. target domain) is often degraded in clinical scenarios due to the variations that were not encountered in training data (a.k.a. source domain). Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of LDCT reconstruction has been proposed to solve this problem through distribution alignment. However, existing UDA methods fail to explore the usage of uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable intelligent medical systems in clinical scenarios with unexpected variations. Moreover, existing direct alignment for different patients would lead to content mismatch issues. To address these issues, we propose to leverage a probabilistic reconstruction framework to conduct a joint discrepancy minimization between source and target domains in both the latent and image spaces. In the latent space, we devise a Bayesian uncertainty alignment to reduce the epistemic gap between the two domains. This approach reduces the uncertainty level of target domain data, making it more likely to render well-reconstructed results on target domains. In the image space, we propose a sharpness-aware distribution alignment to achieve a match of second-order information, which can ensure that the reconstructed images from the target domain have similar sharpness to normal-dose CT images from the source domain. Experimental results on two simulated datasets and one clinical low-dose imaging dataset show that our proposed method outperforms other methods in quantitative and visualized performance."
2302.13293,PDIWS: Thermal Imaging Dataset for Person Detection in Intrusion Warning   Systems,"In this paper, we present a synthetic thermal imaging dataset for Person Detection in Intrusion Warning Systems (PDIWS). The dataset consists of a training set with 2000 images and a test set with 500 images. Each image is synthesized by compounding a subject (intruder) with a background using the modified Poisson image editing method. There are a total of 50 different backgrounds and nearly 1000 subjects divided into five classes according to five human poses: creeping, crawling, stooping, climbing and other. The presence of the intruder will be confirmed if the first four poses are detected. Advanced object detection algorithms have been implemented with this dataset and give relatively satisfactory results, with the highest mAP values of 95.5% and 90.9% for IoU of 0.5 and 0.75 respectively. The dataset is freely published online for research purposes at https://github.com/thuan-researcher/Intruder-Thermal-Dataset."
2302.13336,Key-Exchange Convolutional Auto-Encoder for Data Augmentation in Early   Knee Osteoarthritis Detection,"Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal condition that significantly affects mobility and quality of life, particularly in elderly populations. However, training deep learning models for early KOA classification is often hampered by the limited availability of annotated medical datasets, owing to the high costs and labour-intensive nature of data labelling. Traditional data augmentation techniques, while useful, rely on simple transformations and fail to introduce sufficient diversity into the dataset. To address these challenges, we propose the Key-Exchange Convolutional Auto-Encoder (KECAE) as an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data augmentation strategy for early KOA classification. Our model employs a convolutional autoencoder with a novel key-exchange mechanism that generates synthetic images by selectively exchanging key pathological features between X-ray images, which not only diversifies the dataset but also ensures the clinical validity of the augmented data. A hybrid loss function is introduced to supervise feature learning and reconstruction, integrating multiple components, including reconstruction, supervision, and feature separation losses. Experimental results demonstrate that the KECAE-generated data significantly improve the performance of KOA classification models, with accuracy gains of up to 1.98% across various standard and state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, a clinical validation study involving expert radiologists confirms the anatomical plausibility and diagnostic realism of the synthetic outputs. These findings highlight the potential of KECAE as a robust tool for augmenting medical datasets in early KOA detection."
2302.13546,Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Deep Image Prior-Based Robust PET Image   Denoising,"Deep image prior (DIP) has been successfully applied to positron emission tomography (PET) image restoration, enabling represent implicit prior using only convolutional neural network architecture without training dataset, whereas the general supervised approach requires massive low- and high-quality PET image pairs. To answer the increased need for PET imaging with DIP, it is indispensable to improve the performance of the underlying DIP itself. Here, we propose a self-supervised pre-training model to improve the DIP-based PET image denoising performance. Our proposed pre-training model acquires transferable and generalizable visual representations from only unlabeled PET images by restoring various degraded PET images in a self-supervised approach. We evaluated the proposed method using clinical brain PET data with various radioactive tracers ($^{18}$F-florbetapir, $^{11}$C-Pittsburgh compound-B, $^{18}$F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, and $^{15}$O-CO$_{2}$) acquired from different PET scanners. The proposed method using the self-supervised pre-training model achieved robust and state-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial details and quantification accuracy compared to other unsupervised methods and pre-training model. These results highlight the potential that the proposed method is particularly effective against rare diseases and probes and helps reduce the scan time or the radiotracer dose without affecting the patients."
2302.13961,Soft labelling for semantic segmentation: Bringing coherence to label   down-sampling,"In semantic segmentation, training data down-sampling is commonly performed due to limited resources, the need to adapt image size to the model input, or improve data augmentation. This down-sampling typically employs different strategies for the image data and the annotated labels. Such discrepancy leads to mismatches between the down-sampled color and label images. Hence, the training performance significantly decreases as the down-sampling factor increases. In this paper, we bring together the down-sampling strategies for the image data and the training labels. To that aim, we propose a novel framework for label down-sampling via soft-labeling that better conserves label information after down-sampling. Therefore, fully aligning soft-labels with image data to keep the distribution of the sampled pixels. This proposal also produces reliable annotations for under-represented semantic classes. Altogether, it allows training competitive models at lower resolutions. Experiments show that the proposal outperforms other down-sampling strategies. Moreover, state-of-the-art performance is achieved for reference benchmarks, but employing significantly less computational resources than foremost approaches. This proposal enables competitive research for semantic segmentation under resource constraints."
2302.13991,Learning to Generalize towards Unseen Domains via a Content-Aware Style   Invariant Model for Disease Detection from Chest X-rays,"Performance degradation due to distribution discrepancy is a longstanding challenge in intelligent imaging, particularly for chest X-rays (CXRs). Recent studies have demonstrated that CNNs are biased toward styles (e.g., uninformative textures) rather than content (e.g., shape), in stark contrast to the human vision system. Radiologists tend to learn visual cues from CXRs and thus perform well across multiple domains. Motivated by this, we employ the novel on-the-fly style randomization modules at both image (SRM-IL) and feature (SRM-FL) levels to create rich style perturbed features while keeping the content intact for robust cross-domain performance. Previous methods simulate unseen domains by constructing new styles via interpolation or swapping styles from existing data, limiting them to available source domains during training. However, SRM-IL samples the style statistics from the possible value range of a CXR image instead of the training data to achieve more diversified augmentations. Moreover, we utilize pixel-wise learnable parameters in the SRM-FL compared to pre-defined channel-wise mean and standard deviations as style embeddings for capturing more representative style features. Additionally, we leverage consistency regularizations on global semantic features and predictive distributions from with and without style-perturbed versions of the same CXR to tweak the model's sensitivity toward content markers for accurate predictions. Our proposed method, trained on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR datasets, achieves 77.32$\pm$0.35, 88.38$\pm$0.19, 82.63$\pm$0.13 AUCs(%) on the unseen domain test datasets, i.e., BRAX, VinDr-CXR, and NIH chest X-ray14, respectively, compared to 75.56$\pm$0.80, 87.57$\pm$0.46, 82.07$\pm$0.19 from state-of-the-art models on five-fold cross-validation with statistically significant results in thoracic disease classification."
2302.14302,Improving Model Generalization by On-manifold Adversarial Augmentation   in the Frequency Domain,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) may suffer from significantly degenerated performance when the training and test data are of different underlying distributions. Despite the importance of model generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on OOD data can plummet. Recent work has demonstrated that regular or off-manifold adversarial examples, as a special case of data augmentation, can be used to improve OOD generalization. Inspired by this, we theoretically prove that on-manifold adversarial examples can better benefit OOD generalization. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to generate on-manifold adversarial examples because the real manifold is generally complex. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method of Augmenting data with Adversarial examples via a Wavelet module (AdvWavAug), an on-manifold adversarial data augmentation technique that is simple to implement. In particular, we project a benign image into a wavelet domain. With the assistance of the sparsity characteristic of wavelet transformation, we can modify an image on the estimated data manifold. We conduct adversarial augmentation based on AdvProp training framework. Extensive experiments on different models and different datasets, including ImageNet and its distorted versions, demonstrate that our method can improve model generalization, especially on OOD data. By integrating AdvWavAug into the training process, we have achieved SOTA results on some recent transformer-based models."
2302.14323,Read Pointer Meters in complex environments based on a Human-like   Alignment and Recognition Algorithm,"Recently, developing an automatic reading system for analog measuring instruments has gained increased attention, as it enables the collection of numerous state of equipment. Nonetheless, two major obstacles still obstruct its deployment to real-world applications. The first issue is that they rarely take the entire pipeline's speed into account. The second is that they are incapable of dealing with some low-quality images (i.e., meter breakage, blur, and uneven scale). In this paper, we propose a human-like alignment and recognition algorithm to overcome these problems. More specifically, a Spatial Transformed Module(STM) is proposed to obtain the front view of images in a self-autonomous way based on an improved Spatial Transformer Networks(STN). Meanwhile, a Value Acquisition Module(VAM) is proposed to infer accurate meter values by an end-to-end trained framework. In contrast to previous research, our model aligns and recognizes meters totally implemented by learnable processing, which mimics human's behaviours and thus achieves higher performances. Extensive results verify the good robustness of the proposed model in terms of the accuracy and efficiency."
2302.14368,Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models via Feature Disentanglement   and Realism-Enhanced Sampling Methods,"As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation."
2302.14383,Linear Spaces of Meanings: Compositional Structures in Vision-Language   Models,"We investigate compositional structures in data embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Traditionally, compositionality has been associated with algebraic operations on embeddings of words from a pre-existing vocabulary. In contrast, we seek to approximate representations from an encoder as combinations of a smaller set of vectors in the embedding space. These vectors can be seen as ""ideal words"" for generating concepts directly within the embedding space of the model. We first present a framework for understanding compositional structures from a geometric perspective. We then explain what these compositional structures entail probabilistically in the case of VLM embeddings, providing intuitions for why they arise in practice. Finally, we empirically explore these structures in CLIP's embeddings and we evaluate their usefulness for solving different vision-language tasks such as classification, debiasing, and retrieval. Our results show that simple linear algebraic operations on embedding vectors can be used as compositional and interpretable methods for regulating the behavior of VLMs."
2302.14409,An Adaptive Method for Camera Attribution under Complex Radial   Distortion Corrections,"Radial correction distortion, applied by in-camera or out-camera software/firmware alters the supporting grid of the image so as to hamper PRNU-based camera attribution. Existing solutions to deal with this problem try to invert/estimate the correction using radial transformations parameterized with few variables in order to restrain the computational load; however, with ever more prevalent complex distortion corrections their performance is unsatisfactory. In this paper we propose an adaptive algorithm that by dividing the image into concentric annuli is able to deal with sophisticated corrections like those applied out-camera by third party software like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Gimp and PT-Lens. We also introduce a statistic called cumulative peak of correlation energy (CPCE) that allows for an efficient early stopping strategy. Experiments on a large dataset of in-camera and out-camera radially corrected images show that our solution improves the state of the art in terms of both accuracy and computational cost."
2302.14418,PCR-CG: Point Cloud Registration via Deep Explicit Color and Geometry,"In this paper, we introduce PCR-CG: a novel 3D point cloud registration module explicitly embedding the color signals into the geometry representation. Different from previous methods that only use geometry representation, our module is specifically designed to effectively correlate color into geometry for the point cloud registration task. Our key contribution is a 2D-3D cross-modality learning algorithm that embeds the deep features learned from color signals to the geometry representation. With our designed 2D-3D projection module, the pixel features in a square region centered at correspondences perceived from images are effectively correlated with point clouds. In this way, the overlapped regions can be inferred not only from point cloud but also from the texture appearances. Adding color is non-trivial. We compare against a variety of baselines designed for adding color to 3D, such as exhaustively adding per-pixel features or RGB values in an implicit manner. We leverage Predator [25] as the baseline method and incorporate our proposed module onto it. To validate the effectiveness of 2D features, we ablate different 2D pre-trained networks and show a positive correlation between the pre-trained weights and the task performance. Our experimental results indicate a significant improvement of 6.5% registration recall over the baseline method on the 3DLoMatch benchmark. We additionally evaluate our approach on SOTA methods and observe consistent improvements, such as an improvement of 2.4% registration recall over GeoTransformer as well as 3.5% over CoFiNet. Our study reveals a significant advantages of correlating explicit deep color features to the point cloud in the registration task."
2302.14431,Efficient Masked Autoencoders with Self-Consistency,"Inspired by the masked language modeling (MLM) in natural language processing tasks, the masked image modeling (MIM) has been recognized as a strong self-supervised pre-training method in computer vision. However, the high random mask ratio of MIM results in two serious problems: 1) the inadequate data utilization of images within each iteration brings prolonged pre-training, and 2) the high inconsistency of predictions results in unreliable generations, $i.e.$, the prediction of the identical patch may be inconsistent in different mask rounds, leading to divergent semantics in the ultimately generated outcomes. To tackle these problems, we propose the efficient masked autoencoders with self-consistency (EMAE) to improve the pre-training efficiency and increase the consistency of MIM. In particular, we present a parallel mask strategy that divides the image into K non-overlapping parts, each of which is generated by a random mask with the same mask ratio. Then the MIM task is conducted parallelly on all parts in an iteration and the model minimizes the loss between the predictions and the masked patches. Besides, we design the self-consistency learning to further maintain the consistency of predictions of overlapping masked patches among parts. Overall, our method is able to exploit the data more efficiently and obtains reliable representations. Experiments on ImageNet show that EMAE achieves the best performance on ViT-Large with only 13% of MAE pre-training time using NVIDIA A100 GPUs. After pre-training on diverse datasets, EMAE consistently obtains state-of-the-art transfer ability on a variety of downstream tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation."
2302.14470,Learning to Estimate Single-View Volumetric Flow Motions without 3D   Supervision,"We address the challenging problem of jointly inferring the 3D flow and volumetric densities moving in a fluid from a monocular input video with a deep neural network. Despite the complexity of this task, we show that it is possible to train the corresponding networks without requiring any 3D ground truth for training. In the absence of ground truth data we can train our model with observations from real-world capture setups instead of relying on synthetic reconstructions. We make this unsupervised training approach possible by first generating an initial prototype volume which is then moved and transported over time without the need for volumetric supervision. Our approach relies purely on image-based losses, an adversarial discriminator network, and regularization. Our method can estimate long-term sequences in a stable manner, while achieving closely matching targets for inputs such as rising smoke plumes."
2302.14595,MateRobot: Material Recognition in Wearable Robotics for People with   Visual Impairments,"People with Visual Impairments (PVI) typically recognize objects through haptic perception. Knowing objects and materials before touching is desired by the target users but under-explored in the field of human-centered robotics. To fill this gap, in this work, a wearable vision-based robotic system, MateRobot, is established for PVI to recognize materials and object categories beforehand. To address the computational constraints of mobile platforms, we propose a lightweight yet accurate model MateViT to perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation, simultaneously recognizing both objects and materials. Our methods achieve respective 40.2% and 51.1% of mIoU on COCOStuff-10K and DMS datasets, surpassing the previous method with +5.7% and +7.0% gains. Moreover, on the field test with participants, our wearable system reaches a score of 28 in the NASA-Task Load Index, indicating low cognitive demands and ease of use. Our MateRobot demonstrates the feasibility of recognizing material property through visual cues and offers a promising step towards improving the functionality of wearable robots for PVI. The source code has been made publicly available at https://junweizheng93.github.io/publications/MATERobot/MATERobot.html."
2302.14696,Dissolving Is Amplifying: Towards Fine-Grained Anomaly Detection,"Medical imaging often contains critical fine-grained features, such as tumors or hemorrhages, crucial for diagnosis yet potentially too subtle for detection with conventional methods. In this paper, we introduce \textit{DIA}, dissolving is amplifying. DIA is a fine-grained anomaly detection framework for medical images. First, we introduce \textit{dissolving transformations}. We employ diffusion with a generative diffusion model as a dedicated feature-aware denoiser. Applying diffusion to medical images in a certain manner can remove or diminish fine-grained discriminative features. Second, we introduce an \textit{amplifying framework} based on contrastive learning to learn a semantically meaningful representation of medical images in a self-supervised manner, with a focus on fine-grained features. The amplifying framework contrasts additional pairs of images with and without dissolving transformations applied and thereby emphasizes the dissolved fine-grained features. DIA significantly improves the medical anomaly detection performance with around 18.40\% AUC boost against the baseline method and achieves an overall SOTA against other benchmark methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/shijianjian/DIA.git}."
2302.14728,Semantically Consistent Person Image Generation,"We propose a data-driven approach for context-aware person image generation. Specifically, we attempt to generate a person image such that the synthesized instance can blend into a complex scene. In our method, the position, scale, and appearance of the generated person are semantically conditioned on the existing persons in the scene. The proposed technique is divided into three sequential steps. At first, we employ a Pix2PixHD model to infer a coarse semantic mask that represents the new person's spatial location, scale, and potential pose. Next, we use a data-centric approach to select the closest representation from a precomputed cluster of fine semantic masks. Finally, we adopt a multi-scale, attention-guided architecture to transfer the appearance attributes from an exemplar image. The proposed strategy enables us to synthesize semantically coherent realistic persons that can blend into an existing scene without altering the global context. We conclude our findings with relevant qualitative and quantitative evaluations."
2303.00180,MMA-MRNNet: Harnessing Multiple Models of Affect and Dynamic Masked RNN   for Precise Facial Expression Intensity Estimation,"This paper presents MMA-MRNNet, a novel deep learning architecture for dynamic multi-output Facial Expression Intensity Estimation (FEIE) from video data. Traditional approaches to this task often rely on complex 3-D CNNs, which require extensive pre-training and assume that facial expressions are uniformly distributed across all frames of a video. These methods struggle to handle videos of varying lengths, often resorting to ad-hoc strategies that either discard valuable information or introduce bias. MMA-MRNNet addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. First, the Multiple Models of Affect (MMA) extractor component is a Multi-Task Learning CNN that concurrently estimates valence-arousal, recognizes basic facial expressions, and detects action units in each frame. These representations are then processed by a Masked RNN component, which captures temporal dependencies and dynamically updates weights according to the true length of the input video, ensuring that only the most relevant features are used for the final prediction. The proposed unimodal non-ensemble learning MMA-MRNNet was evaluated on the Hume-Reaction dataset and demonstrated significantly superior performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin, regardless of whether they were unimodal, multimodal, or ensemble approaches. Finally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the MMA component of our proposed method across multiple in-the-wild datasets, where it consistently outperformed all state-of-the-art methods across various metrics."
2303.00244,SUNY: A Visual Interpretation Framework for Convolutional Neural   Networks from a Necessary and Sufficient Perspective,"Researchers have proposed various methods for visually interpreting the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) via saliency maps, which include Class-Activation-Map (CAM) based approaches as a leading family. However, in terms of the internal design logic, existing CAM-based approaches often overlook the causal perspective that answers the core ""why"" question to help humans understand the explanation. Additionally, current CNN explanations lack the consideration of both necessity and sufficiency, two complementary sides of a desirable explanation. This paper presents a causality-driven framework, SUNY, designed to rationalize the explanations toward better human understanding. Using the CNN model's input features or internal filters as hypothetical causes, SUNY generates explanations by bi-directional quantifications on both the necessary and sufficient perspectives. Extensive evaluations justify that SUNY not only produces more informative and convincing explanations from the angles of necessity and sufficiency, but also achieves performances competitive to other approaches across different CNN architectures over large-scale datasets, including ILSVRC2012 and CUB-200-2011."
